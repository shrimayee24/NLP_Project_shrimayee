‘Who are you to object?': Jharkhand HC judge slams IAS officer over compensation by state govt; video goes viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/who-are-you-to-object-jharkhand-hc-judge-slams-ias-officer-over-compensation-by-state-govt-video-goes-viral/articleshow/123577011.cms,"Image: X@/kumarmanish9

This is a property of the state government, right?

Do you want commission?

Social media reacts



A video from the Jharkhand high court surfaced online showing a judge sternly reprimanding an IAS officer during a hearing. In the clip, which is now going viral on social media, the judge can be seen calling out the officer over alleged discrepancies and irregularities.The IAS officer’s name and posting remain unverified, but the judge is heard warning that an FIR will be filed to initiate an investigation.The incident reportedly took place when the judge was hearing a case related to land acquisition and compensation, but the IAS officer had objected to the compensation being offered to the petitioner.“Who are you to object? Ye state ka property hai na? () the judge can be heard saying in the video.""If the state has recognised any person as a ryot, who are you to say that person is not a ryot. You are an alien to the dispute,"" the judge further added.The judge also accused the officer of taking commissions while questioning his authority to object, saying he was preventing rightful awards from being given.“Commission chahiye aapko? () You want commission in each and every case? Under what authority you have objected? The award has been prepared.You are depriving the person of getting the award” the judge said.“You have to take contempt or I will lodge an FIR against you” he said.“Don’t raise a dispute if you are an outsider. In a property dispute, will you come in like a monkey to claim a share?” the judge can be heard saying.The video has drawn appreciation from the public for how the judge handled the situation.“Wow!! Simply awesome. So satisfying to watch this episode. The bureaucrat thought he was above law for a moment. Hats off to you, the judiciary, and judge,” a user commented.“If all Judges take the right approach and ask all IAS officers, EC, and ED to apply law as per the Constitution, 50 percent cases will go away from court,” commented another.“Judicial accountability in action! The judge's sharp questioning demonstrates that courts are taking corruption seriously. This direct approach could deter future misconduct if consistently applied across all levels of bureaucracy,” read another comment.","A video from the Jharkhand high court surfaced online showing a judge sternly reprimanding an IAS officer during a hearing.

Taco Bell CTO admits AI cannot work everywhere; says company now reconsidering where and where not to use the AI going forward,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/taco-bell-cto-admits-ai-cannot-work-everywhere-says-company-now-reconsidering-where-and-where-not-to-use-the-ai-going-forward/articleshow/123605121.cms,"Representative Image

What Taco Bell CTO said about using AI in the company’s operations



“Like many people, sometimes it falls short, but other times it really impresses me,”

“For our teams, we’ll help coach them: at your restaurant, at these times, we recommend you use voice AI or recommend that you actually really monitor voice AI and jump in as necessary,”

“I can tell you it’s a very active conversation inside Taco Bell in partnership with our franchisees. I think at the end of the day, it’s really, really early. And we feel that. And I think other brands feel that, too,”

Taco Bell is reconsidering its use of artificial intelligence (AI) for food ordering. This decision from the American fast food chain came after its new voice AI system, which has been installed at over 500 drive-thru locations across the US, received mixed reviews. The company's Chief Digital and Technology Officer, Dane Mathews , admitted they are ""learning a lot"" from the experience. The voice AI has been met with social media complaints about glitches, delays, and general customer discomfort. Some users have also been intentionally ""trolling"" the system with unusual orders, such as asking for “18,000 cups of water.”In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Mathews described his experience with the technology as inconsistent.he said.He added that he is now considering more carefully when it makes sense to rely on the technology. Using AI at every drive-through may not always be practical, he noted. Matthews also pointed out that in busy locations with long lines, a human staff member could manage the situation more effectively.Mathews added that he plans to work with restaurants to help them navigate the decision.he explained.However, Taco Bell is still refining its plans while reviewing data from over two million customer orders handled by AI.Matthews highlighted.Nearly three years into the generative AI wave, companies are still testing and revising their strategies, unsure of where the technology fits best. However, drive-through voice AI remains a challenge.McDonald’s dropped its IBM trial and is now working with Google Cloud, while Wendy’s is also expanding its FreshAi system built on Google tech. On the other hand, Taco Bell’s parent, Yum Brands, has partnered with Nvidia to explore potential AI applicattions.","Taco Bell is reconsidering its use of artificial intelligence (AI) for food ordering.

The WhatsApp Scam That Gives Hackers Your Phone!

WhatsApp has said that it uncovered a cyberespionage , or hacking, operation that exploited multiple security vulnerabilities across its platform and Apple devices to conduct targeted surveillance of users, with reportedly civil society activists appearing to be among the primary targets. In a statement issued, the Meta-owned company said that it has plugged the loop holes that hackers used to attack specific users.“Incomplete authorization of linked device synchronization messages in WhatsApp for iOS prior to v2.25.21.73, WhatsApp Business for iOS v2.25.21.78, and WhatsApp for Mac v2.25.21.78 could have allowed an unrelated user to trigger processing of content from an arbitrary URL on a target’s device,” WhatsApp said in a statement.The Meta-owned messaging service disclosed the security breach in a brief statement, revealing that hackers had discovered and weaponised a chain of vulnerabilities that allowed them to compromise both the WhatsApp application and Apple devices in coordinated attacks.“We assess that this vulnerability, in combination with an OS-level vulnerability on Apple platforms (CVE-2025-43300), may have been exploited in a sophisticated attack against specific targeted users,” the company added, without revealing much about the cyber attack.However, a report by news agency Reuters said that an estimated 200 users worldwide have potentially been compromised during the espionage campaign.Donncha O Cearbhaill, who heads Amnesty International's Security Lab, said that members of civic organisations appear to be among those affected by the surveillance operation.“WhatsApp has just sent out a round of threat notifications to individuals they believe where targeted by an advanced spyware campaign in past 90 days. Seek out expert help if you have received this alert,” he said.“Early indications are that the WhatsApp attack is impacting both iPhone and Android users, civil society individuals among them. Government spyware continues to pose a threat to journalists and human rights defenders,” O Cearbhaill wrote in a post on social media platform X.He noted that the Apple vulnerability was in a core image library, advising people that they should update their devices and enable iOS Lockdown Mode or Android‘s Advanced Protection Mode to help protect against attacks like this.","Amnesty International's Security Lab says civic organisations may be a target of the cyber attack.

Former GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke had defended Microsoft 's controversial internal memo requiring managers to evaluate employees based on their AI tool usage , arguing that measuring artificial intelligence adoption should focus on cultural alignment rather than quantifiable metrics like code generation. Speaking on the ""Decoder"" podcast that aired August 7, Dohmke explained that simply counting AI-generated lines of code would be ""easily gamified"" and miss the broader point of fostering an AI-forward organizational mindset. Instead, he emphasized that evaluation should center on whether employees demonstrate willingness to learn and integrate AI tools into their workflow.The former GitHub executive backed a June memo from Julia Liuson, president of Microsoft's developer tools division, which stated that ""using AI is no longer optional"" and should be part of managers' performance evaluations. Business Insider first reported on the internal directive earlier this year.Cultural transformation over metricsDohmke characterized the Microsoft memo as ""totally fair game"" for 2025, suggesting that companies should expect employees to reflect on their AI learning and usage of tools like GitHub Copilot, Microsoft Copilot, and Teams Copilot for meeting summaries.The former CEO drew parallels to GitHub's company culture during his tenure, where every employee across all departments—from HR to sales to legal—was required to use GitHub's platform. He made clear that employees uncomfortable with this requirement could find opportunities at ""tens of thousands of other tech companies.""Dohmke described the evaluation process as ""more nuanced"" than simple usage tracking, focusing instead on meaningful conversations between managers and employees about AI learning and adoption. This approach, he argued, aligned with Microsoft's growth-oriented culture that prioritizes continuous learning and adaptation during his time leading GitHub.The stance reflects broader industry shifts toward mandatory AI integration, with companies increasingly viewing artificial intelligence proficiency as essential for competitive advantage rather than optional technological enhancement.","Former GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke defended Microsoft's controversial internal memo.

Apple Hebbal & Koregaon Park Stores to Open This September

Apple iPhone 17 series will launch on September 9. The Cupertino-based company has scheduled an ‘Awe Dropping’ event for 10:30pm next month where it will unveil 2025 iPhone lineup that may include four models, namely iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max and a slim model rumoured to be called iPhone 17 Plus. ahead of the launch, a new leak has appeared online which says that Apple is also planning to bring a new accessory this year. Tipster Majin Bu says that the company may bring Crossbody Strap, designed primarily for iPhone 17 cases.The upcoming Crossbody Strap is said to feature a flexible metal core to make it fully magnetic along its entire length. Rings at the ends will be polarized opposite to the strap, locking the system firmly for a strong grip. This design makes attaching and removing easy without using hooks or loops, offering a practical option for iPhone 17 cases.The leakster adds that the strap could also be compatible with AirPods Pro 3, expanding its range of uses. The report also shares samples of the upcoming strap which shows a woven nylon body, similar to that used in Sport Loop Bands. Apple may introduce a silicone variant as well. The upcoming iPhone accessory is rumoured to be offered in multiple colour options.Apple’s upcoming iPhone 17 series is expected to feature display sizes similar to the current lineup, with the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max retaining their 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch screens. The new iPhone 17 Air is likely to sit between these two in size. The screen size of the standard iPhone 17 may grow to 6.3 inches, matching the Pro model.Early reports hinted that the slimmer iPhone 17 Air might be a premium device priced higher than the Pro Max. However, sources now indicate it will be a mid-range model, cheaper than both the Pro and Pro Max but more expensive than the standard iPhone 17. This positions it as a direct replacement for the “Plus” model, offering a middle ground in size and price.All four iPhone 17 models are expected to get ProMotion display technology with a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video playback, a feature that was earlier exclusive to Pro models. This upgrade will be made possible by LTPO OLED panels. While LTPO displays also allow for an always-on screen, it is not yet confirmed if this feature will come to all models or remain Pro-only.For the Pro versions, Apple may replace titanium with aluminum for part of the frame, while keeping glass for MagSafe charging. This could result in a half-glass, half-aluminum build that improves durability. A new horizontal pill-shaped camera bump may replace the current square design, with the iPhone 17 Air also tipped to adopt this layout.Powering the iPhone 17 lineup is expected to be Apple’s new A19 Pro chip, built using TSMC’s latest 3nm process for improved speed and power efficiency. For the first time, iPhones could come with 12GB of RAM, allowing smoother multitasking and enabling advanced Apple Intelligence AI features.All iPhone models set to launch in 2025 are rumored to get a major front camera upgrade, moving from the 12-megapixel lens in the iPhone 16 series to a new 24-megapixel sensor. This improvement is expected to deliver sharper photos and allow users to crop images without losing detail.The iPhone 17 Pro Max is tipped to be the first iPhone with three 48-megapixel rear cameras — a Wide, an Ultra Wide, and a Tetraprism Telephoto lens — and may also support 8K video recording for the first time. The iPhone 17 Air is expected to come with a single 48-megapixel rear camera, while the standard iPhone 17 will likely feature a dual-lens setup with Wide and Ultra Wide cameras.The Pro models could introduce a mechanical aperture, allowing users to adjust how much light enters the camera for better control over depth-of-field — a first for iPhones, which currently use fixed apertures. They might also add dual video recording, letting users film with both the front and rear cameras at the same time, a feature popular with content creators but currently limited to some third-party apps.The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will continue to offer a 5x Telephoto optical zoom, which will remain exclusive to the Pro lineup. The standard iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air will not include Telephoto lenses or 5x zoom capabilities.Apple is also said to be working on a 3-year iPhone overhaul strategy with a foldable iPhone coming in 2026.",Apple iPhone 17 series will launch on September 9. The company has scheduled an ‘Awe Dropping’ event for 10:30pm next month where it will unveil 2025 iPhone lineup that may include four models. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are expected to retain their 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch screens. The new iPhone 17 Air is likely to sit between these two in size. The standard iPhone 17 will likely feature a dual-lens setup with Wide and Ultra Wide cameras.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123581189,imgsize-10756,width-400,resizemode-4/iphone-17-launch-on-september-9.jpg"

South Korea has enacted nationwide legislation banning smartphone use in school classrooms, with lawmakers passing the bill on Wednesday, August 26, 2025, to address growing concerns about smartphone addiction among students, as per a report by BBC. The measure, approved by 115 out of 163 lawmakers present, aims to improve academic performance and social interactions among children and teenagers, with implementation scheduled for the next school year beginning March 2026.The new legislation comes as South Korean educators, parents, and lawmakers have observed declining academic progress and performance linked to excessive smartphone use in educational settings. The ban encompasses mobile phones and other smart devices within classroom environments.The initiative aligns South Korea with several other nations that have implemented similar restrictions. Countries including Finland and France have established phone bans specifically for younger students, while Italy, the Netherlands, and China have implemented broader restrictions across all school levels.Many South Korean schools had already implemented various forms of smartphone restrictions prior to this nationwide mandate.The new law formalizes these practices and establishes consistent standards across the country's educational institutions.The implementation timeline provides schools and educational authorities several months to prepare for the transition and establish necessary protocols before the law takes effect in March 2026.The ban reflects growing global awareness of smartphone addiction among youngsters and its potential impact on educational outcomes. Educational institutions worldwide are increasingly examining their policies regarding mobile device use in academic settings.","South Korea has enacted nationwide legislation banning smartphone use in school classrooms.

Expert Drops Bombshell





The 30th anniversary of Princess Diana’s death may reignite one of the monarchy’s most bitter rivalries. According to royal expert Tom Sykes, Prince William and Prince Harry could be planning competing documentaries on their late mother—threatening to turn her legacy into their latest battleground.Speaking on The Daily Beast podcast, Sykes revealed that he’s heard “on good authority” that the brothers, who have not spoken in years, are exploring separate projects to commemorate Diana in 2027. William is reportedly “not remotely amused” by whispers that Harry and Meghan Markle are working on a Netflix feature tied to their Archewell deal—especially after previous projects were panned as “boring” and “disastrous. ”“We could have dueling Diana documentaries from the two boys,” Sykes suggested, noting how such films could cement their clashing narratives about the princess’s life and the events surrounding her 1997 death.The timing comes as Sykes himself stirs controversy with a fresh essay revisiting conspiracy theories about Diana’s fatal Paris car crash, raising questions about whether her death was as straightforward as official inquiries concluded.While he stops short of calling for the case to be reopened, Sykes insists “the holes in the story are just so fascinating, it’s all hidden in plain sight.”Diana was killed on August 31, 1997, when a Mercedes driven by Henri Paul crashed in a Paris underpass. Paul and Diana’s companion, Dodi Fayed, also died. An official investigation blamed speed and Paul’s intoxication, but speculation about foul play has never fully disappeared.Now, as the brothers approach this milestone anniversary on opposite sides of the Atlantic, Diana’s memory risks becoming collateral damage in their fractured relationship.","The 30th anniversary of Princess Diana's death may reignite one of the monarchy's most bitter rivalries.

A video from Birmingham has gone viral after capturing a woman, identified online as an Indian student, demanding £20 (about Rs 2,300) from a car owner after wiping his window.The clip shows the student approaching a parked vehicle, cleaning the glass, and insisting on payment. Surprised by the demand, the car owner recorded the incident and uploaded it to social media, where it has now crossed two million views.In the footage, the owner is heard asking, “for what?” when the student demands £20. She replies, “I just cleaned your window,” prompting him to respond, “you just did a quick wipe. Look, I’m confused – £20?” To this, she insists, “yeah, I mean that is the cost of living.”The exchange escalates as the student blocks the car, warning, “You will have to knock me if you want to leave,” and refusing to let him go without paying. The owner then calls her a “robber,” saying, “this is what robbers look like nowadays apparently.”The video has triggered sharp reactions online, with many users labeling it as “scripted” or “staged” for social media engagement. One user wrote, “Isn’t she the same girl who hit a parked car for insurance, just realised even that was staged.” Another commented, “Staged, this girl appeared in so many videos like this. But it’s not cool as she is damaging the image of India and many people don’t know that it’s just an act. ”Such staged “street encounter” clips, according to users, have become a rising trend on social media, blurring the line between authentic incidents and content created purely for clout.","A video from Birmingham has gone viral after capturing a woman, identified online as an Indian student, demanding £20.

"UAE: Dubai tenants now must share details of who they live with on Ejari platform, how to fill in co-living details",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-dubai-tenants-now-must-share-details-of-who-they-live-with-on-ejari-platform-how-to-fill-in-co-living-details/articleshow/123598929.cms,"Tenants in Dubai must now use the Dubai REST app to register co-living residents, including details like Emirates ID and birthdates/ Representative image

The new requirement: Co-living persons must be registered on Ejari

How tenants can comply: A step-by-step guide

Visa and Residency: Ejari is also a key requirement for processing residency visas.





and Residency: Ejari is also a key requirement for processing residency visas. Legal Enforceability: Non-registered tenancy contracts are inadmissible in court, making Ejari vital for resolving rental-related legal matters.





Why this change matters for tenants and landlords





Dubai tenants are now required to update their Ejari contracts with the details of all individuals living in their apartments or villas. This new mandate comes as part of a government crackdown on unlicensed co-living arrangements, aiming to ensure that only authorized residents occupy rented properties. The change requires tenants to provide full details of everyone living in their unit, regardless of whether they are the primary tenant or a co-occupant. With this step, Dubai’s authorities are tightening enforcement of tenancy laws, ensuring that only those officially listed are permitted to reside in a property.As of recent, landlords in Dubai have started scrutinizing the details included in Ejari contracts to ensure that the names of all individuals residing in a property are listed. The rules are simple: any person staying in the unit for a month or longer must be entered into the system using the Dubai REST app. Failure to do so can lead to complications, with landlords pressing tenants to provide the missing information.The initiative comes as the Dubai Land Department (DLD) intensifies efforts to eliminate unlicensed co-living arrangements. Landlords who continue to violate these regulations face stringent penalties, as the authorities adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards unauthorized shared living.The process of registering co-living individuals on the Ejari system is straightforward, especially with the help of the Dubai REST app, The Ejari contracts are registered with the Dubai Land Department in the name of either the principal tenant or the landlord.Tenants must follow these steps to update their records:The updated rules apply to family members, domestic help, and any other co-occupants who reside in the unit. This is crucial for tenants who wish to avoid issues when dealing with government agencies, utilities, and landlords.Ejari, which means ""My Rent"" in Arabic, is a mandatory rental registration system introduced by the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) under the Dubai Land Department (DLD) in 2007. It serves as the backbone of Dubai’s rental market, ensuring that all agreements are legally documented. Here's why Ejari matters:By ensuring that all co-residents are accurately recorded, Ejari adds transparency to Dubai’s rental market and helps maintain accountability.With stricter enforcement of housing laws, the importance of complying with Ejari regulations cannot be overstated. Tenants benefit from Ejari by ensuring their rental agreements are properly documented, which is essential when setting up utilities, renewing visas, or even resolving disputes. For landlords, having a valid and properly registered Ejari contract provides legal protection and ensures they are not unintentionally breaking any laws.Furthermore, the recent crackdown on unlicensed shared living arrangements is a reminder for tenants to be diligent about their housing agreements. Landlords who permit unauthorized occupants without the proper registrations face heavy penalties, which may include fines or even loss of their ability to lease properties.","Dubai tenants are now required to update their Ejari contracts with the details of all individuals living in their apartments or villas.

Tiny robot captures secrets of the Great Pyramid: Exploring Queen's hidden Chamber for the first time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/tiny-robot-captures-secrets-of-the-great-pyramid-exploring-queens-hidden-chamber-for-the-first-time/articleshow/123578165.cms,"

A remarkable journey inside the Great Pyramid



Hidden symbols and their potential meaning

Preserving history through technology





For more than 4,500 years, Egypt’s Great Pyramid of Giza has intrigued explorers, historians, and archaeologists, holding mysteries that have long eluded discovery. Now, a tiny, purpose-built robot weighing just 5 kg has offered an unprecedented glimpse into one of the pyramid’s most inaccessible areas: a narrow shaft leading out of the Queen’s Chamber. Designed to navigate the 20 cm by 20 cm passage without damaging the ancient structure, the robot captured footage that revealed previously unseen chambers and intricate painted symbols on the stone floor, challenging traditional assumptions about the pyramid’s construction and purpose.The robot’s journey is part of the Djedi Project, led by engineers from the University of Leeds in collaboration with inventor Dr. Tze Chuen Ng. Their goal was to explore the mysterious shafts without harming the centuries-old stones, combining ingenuity, robotics, and patience over several years. This small device’s careful ascent has opened a window into the secrets of a monument that has fascinated the world for millennia.The Queen’s Chamber shaft, which rises at a 40-degree angle, had long resisted exploration due to its narrow dimensions.Previous attempts to probe it caused damage, making a safe, non-invasive approach essential. After nearly five years of development, the tiny 5 kg robot was able to navigate the 60-meter shaft gently, bypassing one blocking stone with a flexible camera arm. Beyond it, the robot discovered a small sealed chamber featuring colored symbols painted directly on the stone floor, hinting at symbolic or ritualistic significance. A second stone further along the shaft blocked the robot, leaving what lies beyond still unknown. The discovery adds yet another layer to the ongoing mystery of the Great Pyramid, showing that even the smallest spaces may hide details of great cultural value. It also reinforces the idea that every exploration inside this monument brings the world a step closer to understanding how and why it was built.The discovery of painted markings challenges the idea that the shafts served solely as air vents. Experts suggest the artwork may indicate ceremonial or symbolic purposes, possibly tied to ancient Egyptian beliefs about the afterlife and the pharaoh’s soul. The deliberate placement of multiple stones also suggests intentional concealment, reinforcing the theory that these spaces had more than just architectural function. Though further exploration is on hold due to security concerns in Egypt, the robot’s footage provides a rare and invaluable view into these long-hidden chambers. The discoveries have reignited worldwide fascination with ancient Egypt, inspiring both researchers and enthusiasts to look closer at the pyramids’ hidden secrets. Experts believe that continued technological innovation may uncover even more chambers, reshaping our understanding of Egyptian history. Such findings remind us that the Great Pyramid is not just an architectural wonder but also a cultural and spiritual symbol. Each new clue adds to its enduring story, proving that its mysteries are far from exhausted even after thousands of years.While the full mysteries of the Great Pyramid remain elusive, the tiny robot’s expedition demonstrates the potential of modern technology to illuminate ancient secrets. By combining robotics, careful engineering, and digital documentation, researchers have not only avoided damaging the pyramid but also sparked renewed global interest in Egyptology. The released footage allows historians, archaeologists, and the public to engage with these discoveries directly, offering insights into a monument that continues to inspire awe more than four millennia after its construction. The Djedi Project team hopes to resume exploration once conditions in Egypt allow, potentially unlocking more hidden chambers. These findings could mark just the beginning of a new era in non-invasive archaeology.","The robot was designed to navigate the 20 cm by 20 cm passage without damaging the ancient structure.

Q. What if my car’s headlights are faulty or not working?

Q. Are aftermarket Xenon or LED headlights legal in the UAE?

Q. When can high beams legally be used?

Driving in the UAE after sunset without proper headlights is both unlawful and dangerous. Motorists are required by law to use their vehicle’s lights between sunset and sunrise and during poor visibility conditions, such as fog and heavy rain. Failure to follow these rules not only risks lives, but also attracts steep penalties and black points on the driver’s licence.Driving without your headlights after sunset, or during low visibility such as heavy rain and fog, constitutes a traffic violation under UAE law. Police actively enforce these rules to keep roads safer. The official penalty for driving without headlights is a Dh500 fine and four black points on your licence, rising to a Dh400 fine and six black points for defective or broken headlights.Headlights aren’t just about keeping your own view clear. Their primary function is to ensure your vehicle is visible to other road users, thereby preventing accidents and collisions. Ignoring this requirement jeopardizes not just the driver, but everyone else on the road.High beams let motorists see farther and are crucial on unlit highways and extremely dark stretches. According to the Dubai Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), they can be safely used only:However, using high beams carelessly, like flashing them at oncoming vehicles or failing to dip them when approaching another car from behind, can blind other drivers and lead to accidents.Drivers are advised to switch to low beams as soon as another vehicle comes into sight, and always dip the lights when following another car.Proper use of headlights is mandatory in the UAE both for safety and compliance. Always ensure your headlights are working and adhere to the law to avoid fines and black points, and only use high beams in appropriate situations to safeguard your own journey and everyone else's.Headlights must be switched on between sunset and sunrise, and during any low-visibility situations such as heavy rain, fog, or dust storms.Driving without headlights at night leads to a Dh500 fine and four black points on your licence.You will incur a Dh400 fine and six black points if caught driving with non-functioning or defective headlights.Aftermarket Xenon headlights are banned. LED headlights are permitted only if they are E-mark certified, installed at GCC-certified workshops, and meet specific safety standards for brightness and colour temperature; modifications must be registered with the RTA.High beams are only allowed on unlit highways or in poor visibility; they should always be dimmed when another vehicle is nearby or when following another car, to prevent dazzling other drivers.",Driving without headlights at night in the UAE can result in a Dh500 fine and four black points.

HUMAIN, as a company, is developing full-stack AI capabilities across four verticals:

Next-generation data centers High-performance infrastructure and cloud platforms Advanced AI models, including multimodal and sector-specific solutions Transformative AI tools for public and private sector innovation

Saudi Arabia has launched HUMAIN Chat, a conversational AI app developed entirely within the Kingdom, marking a major milestone in the region’s artificial intelligence ambitions. Backed by the Public Investment Fund (PIF) and built on the ALLAM 34B large language model, the platform is designed to serve Arabic speakers with linguistic accuracy, cultural relevance, and sovereign data control.HUMAIN Chat is the debut product from HUMAIN, a fully owned subsidiary of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. The company was established in May 2025 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman with the strategic aim of positioning Saudi Arabia as a global hub for artificial intelligence — with a specific focus on Arabic-language capabilities.The launch of HUMAIN Chat signals Saudi Arabia's entry into the global AI landscape with a sovereign, culturally grounded, and technologically advanced offering. The app is powered by ALLAM 34B, HUMAIN’s flagship Arabic large language model, which the company describes as the most advanced Arabic AI model ever developed.Initially available across iOS, Android, and web platforms, the application has been rolled out first in Saudi Arabia, with a regional expansion across the Middle East and a global release planned thereafter.According to CEO Tareq Amin (formerly of Rakuten Symphony), HUMAIN Chat represents a “historic milestone” in building AI that reflects Saudi values, infrastructure, and talent. He emphasized that this launch is only the beginning of a long-term journey to develop AI solutions that serve both regional and global users.ALLAM 34B stands at the core of HUMAIN Chat. This large language model has been developed from the ground up in Saudi Arabia, involving over 120 AI specialists, including 35 Ph.D.-level researchers and a team balanced in gender (50% women). The model was trained on one of the largest Arabic datasets ever compiled and then refined with input from over 600 domain experts and 250 evaluators.The app is built not only to be linguistically accurate but also to reflect Islamic, Middle Eastern, and local cultural contexts — filling a long-standing gap in generative AI for Arabic speakers.The development of ALLAM 34B builds on earlier models from the National Center for AI under the Saudi Data & AI Authority (SDAIA). According to an independent evaluation by Cohere on MMLU benchmarks, ALLAM 34B is now considered the most advanced Arabic LLM produced in the Arab world.The model is bilingual by design but prioritizes Arabic, aiming to serve over 400 million Arabic speakers and 2 billion Muslims globally — a user base historically underserved by mainstream generative AI tools.By combining technical sophistication with cultural sensitivity, HUMAIN Chat seeks to deliver a solution that empowers users to create, learn, and connect in their own linguistic and cultural context.CEO Tareq Amin stressed the symbolic and strategic significance of the release:“We are proving that globally competitive technologies can be rooted in our own language, infrastructure, and values — built in Saudi Arabia by Saudi talent.”HUMAIN Chat is the first release under HUMAIN IQ, a suite of AI-driven products and services that the company plans to expand globally.

What the law actually allows

Royal Lodge context (often bundled into the rumors)

Where public opinion sits

What could change in the next reign

A new sovereign could:

Maintain the 2022 limits;

Tighten style/usage via letters patent (e.g., continued non-use of HRH); or

Ask ministers to explore legislation if removing a peerage were desired.

Bottom line

Facts today:

Talk has picked up again about what happens to Prince Andrew’s titles in the next reign. Several outlets claim Prince William wants a tougher line and could look at further steps once he is king. There is no official plan on record; the stories rely on unnamed sources and remain unconfirmed.In January 2022, Buckingham Palace announced that the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages were returned to the Queen and that he would not undertake public duties; at the same time, briefings confirmed he would no longer use the HRH style in an official capacity. He remains Duke of York and holds no front-line duties. None of that has changed.Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and, in some tellings, press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge. None of this has been announced; it is framed as a possibility, not a decision.A dukedom is a peerage, which is a legal dignity. Removing a peerage requires an Act of Parliament; the House of Lords Library is explicit on this point. The last time Parliament provided a mechanism to strip titles was the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, drafted for wartime enemies, hardly a ready tool for modern scandal.Any fresh action would almost certainly need new legislation.By contrast, styles (like HRH) sit within the sovereign’s power to define by letters patent, hence the 1917 letters patent that limited who is HRH. Using letters patent to refine style/usage is established; using them to annul a peerage would collide with statute and convention. In practice, government-backed legislation is the clean route for removing a dukedom.Prince Andrew holds a 75-year Crown Estate lease on Royal Lodge dating from 2003. Changing his residence would be a landlord-tenant and lease issue, not a simple royal edict. Reporting about pressure to move has see-sawed, but the legal baseline is the lease itself.Recent polling shows strong support for going further: 67% of Britons say Andrew should be stripped of his remaining titles; only 13% are opposed. That mood is real but policy still comes down to law and process.Any move to remove a dukedom would prompt debates on due process, precedent, and where to draw the line for other peers.Andrew does not use HRH, holds no military roles or active patronages, and retains the Duke of York title. Any further step is not something a monarch can do “on a whim”; it would almost certainly require Parliament. Until a legal route exists and is pursued, this remains talk, not policy.","Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge.

"Movement signatures: How we move, gesture, use facial expressions is unique; could be as different as fingerprint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/movement-signatures-how-we-move-gesture-use-facial-expressions-could-be-as-unique-as-fingerprint/articleshow/123483187.cms,"



MANCHESTER: The way someone walks, talks, smiles, or gestures gives a clue to who they are. Whether through the flick of an eyebrow, the rhythm of our walk, or the tilt of a head, movement speaks volumes.And my recent paper shows that people may have their own movement fingerprint. This is a style of movement that is characteristic of a person's identity. So, someone who uses expressive facial gestures might also speak with animated hand movements or walk with a lively gait. These consistencies could form a motion fingerprint that is unique to the individual.First, let's explore how faces move and why this matters.Everyone has their own style of moving their face, for example, how they raise an eyebrow, purse their lips, or squint when laughing. These patterns of movement help us recognise familiar people even when the visual quality is poor, such as in low lighting or from a distance. And as a person becomes more familiar to us, we become tuned to the way they move, learning their unique patterns of motion, just like we remember their face or voice.Human faces are constantly in motion; they blink, smile, grimace and talk, to name a few movements. Researchers categorise facial motion into rigid movements (such as turning or nodding the head) and non-rigid movements (like expressing emotion or speaking). It's the non-rigid movements that tend to be most personally distinctive.The way we gesture with our hands, shift our posture and tilt our heads all carry identity information. Gestures are often shaped by personal habits or cultural norms; for example, someone might habitually nod three times when agreeing, or use a distinctive hand wave common in their home country.Facial movements are synchronised with the way we sound. When we talk, our face plays a role in shaping the sound of our voice. For example, if you talk with a wide open mouth, your speech sounds deeper and richer. Studies show that people can match other people's voices to moving faces more accurately than to static ones. This suggests that dynamic cues to identity are present in the movement of the face and the sound of the voice.People with face recognition difficulties (those who are ""face blind"" or prosopagnosic) may be better at recognising moving faces than still ones. Typically, people who are face blind can see faces and the differences between them, but struggle to link the face to a specific person. Here, idiosyncratic information from movement can provide an additional clue to identity.Gait, a person's walking style, is one of the most studied body movements. Early research, such as a 2005 study, investigated participants' recognition of identity from gait using point-light displays. In this case, bright spots (lights) were placed on key areas of a person's body. All other visual cues were removed. Participants could only see bright spots against a dark background. The study found participants could tell fairly well who someone was from the way the spots moved.Characteristics such as stride length, limb movement, posture and pace form a consistent motion pattern that is unique and surprisingly difficult to fake, making gait analysis a reliable clue for identifying people.Movement fingerprintsMy review brought together evidence from behavioural and brain imaging studies to consider if such consistencies between different types of motion exist and how we might explore this phenomenon further. The paper proposes that people have an overall style of movement.More work needs to be done to find direct evidence of movement fingerprints. For example, we still aren't sure what part of the brain processes these movement-based identity cues.So far, research shows that the posterior temporal sulcus - an area of the brain located roughly above your ear on each side - responds not just to faces and bodies, but to how someone moves more generally. This area is active when we hear voices or see people speak, suggesting it may help link motion and sound. Also, this region plays a key role in allowing us to understand our social world, interpreting other people's actions, determining where they are looking, and picking up on social cues such as gestures, facial expressions and changes in gaze direction.However, it's probably just one part of a larger brain network involved in recognising others through motion.Real-world applicationsMotion-based identity traits aren't as stable or specific as fingerprints or DNA. They're what researchers call soft biometrics: useful but not always accurate.But as we better understand the link between motion and identity, exciting real-world applications are emerging.Motion analysis could support contactless identity verification from gait-based authentication at airports to gesture-based identification in smart environments, such as homes that respond to a user's unique movement patterns. In clinical settings, movement analysis might help support people with social cognition impairments, face recognition or movement issues. For example, helping a doctor identify changes in the way a patient produces non-verbal cues.But many questions remain. We still aren't sure how consistent motion fingerprints are as someone gets older and in different contexts. Individual differences in people and environmental factors like lighting, clothing or stress could affect them.Researchers also aren't sure how exactly we manage to understand all this movement in everyday life without even thinking about it.Figuring this out could not only help improve technologies like social robots and develop tools for people with recognition and communication difficulties, but also tell us more about how we process and react to other people.

SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain dropped a request for Apple to create a tool to give law enforcement access to customers' cloud data.

""Eat at home if you can't afford it! One user asked, ""Why are people these days so lazy to cook?""“This is why you swipe a card before they’re seated. They don’t look like they can afford a McDonald’s, never mind a £200 restaurant bill,"" added the other user.","Four men in Northampton, England, raced away from an Indian restaurant without paying their 200-pound (about Rs 21,000) bill, which led to a spectacular chase by the staff.

Mark Sewards, a British MP for Leeds South West and Morley, has launched an AI version of himself that responds to public complaints using his own voice.He introduced the digital assistant, ""AI Mark"", through his official X account. ""This prototype AI model offers my constituents an additional way to engage with their MP on local casework and policy issues. It can't replace the other work I do – it simply gives people another option to contact me, any time of day,"" Sewards wrote.Encouraging residents to try the tool, he added, ""I encourage any resident of Leeds South West and Morley to give AI Mark a try. This is only a prototype, and every request will help train it and make it better.""The AI responds with supportive messages or offers to forward queries to Sewards' team. While the aim is to make it easier for voters to feel heard by a voice that sounds like their MP, a disclaimer on the website reads:“AI Mark is a prototype digital assistant – this is a work in progress and not everything it says should be taken as fact. All responses are AI-generated.”The chatbot has attracted both interest and criticism from AI experts and the media.The Guardian reported that it struggled with accents, failing to recognise messages from people living just a few kilometres from the constituency’s border.Dr Oman from the University of Sheffield told BBC that the growing use of AI in public services poses challenges, especially for older people. “Many don’t realise they’re speaking to a bot and assume it’s a real person.

A chatty parrot with a knack for drug slang has helped British police crack down on a prison drug ring, squawking its way into an unlikely role in a major narcotics bust, authorities revealed this week.The Lancashire Constabulary filed charges against 15 individuals connected to the gang, which purportedly distributed drugs across Blackpool, England, from February 2023 to July 2024. The operation was orchestrated by 35-year-old Adam Garnett whilst serving a prison sentence, Fox News reported.The case unfolded after prison staff discovered multiple mobile phones and Wi-Fi routers during a search of Garnett's cell. This finding led investigators to his alleged associates, including Dalbir Sandhu, Shannon Hilton and Jason Gerrand.Subsequent home searches revealed heroin, crack cocaine, ketamine, cannabis, substantial cash amounts and mobile phones connected to drug trafficking A notable discovery came from Hilton's phone, containing recordings of her parrot ""Mango"" repeating ""two for 25,"" believed to be drug transaction terminology.Additional footage showed the bird interacting with money allegedly obtained through illegal activities.Video:""What's the most talented thing your pet can do? Sit? Give paw? How about speak?"" Lancashire Police wrote in a post on the department's Facebook page.""One drug dealer's parrot learned to say 'two for 25' - a phrase picked up as part of common language used by the organised crime gang run by her boyfriend. Not a phrase you want your parrot squawking when the police come knocking!""Investigators uncovered video communications between Hilton and Garnett, including footage displaying kilogram-sized cocaine packages, occasionally accompanied by drug-referencing song lyrics.Despite his imprisonment, Garnett reportedly maintained central control, directing evidence concealment efforts and maintaining communication with virtually all network members.Det. Sgt. Anthony Alves of Lancashire Police's West Targeted Crime Team commended the results, describing it as a ""coordinated and complex drug operation that extended far beyond prison walls.""""Garnett continued to run his enterprise while incarcerated, using illegal devices to maintain control. I want to thank my team, our partners at the Crown Prosecution Service, and our prosecution team for their dedication to bringing these criminals to justice.""He noted that warrants remain active for Chloe Stott and Ryan Black, requesting public assistance in locating them.Police reported additional evidence from suspects' devices included videos displaying large cash sums, drug-themed rap lyrics and documented narcotic transactions.Garnett received an additional 19 years and six months imprisonment, consecutive to his existing 15-year sentence. Hilton, 29, received 12 years whilst Sandhu, 41, was given 10 years.The operation formed part of Operation Warrior, Lancashire Police's initiative targeting organised crime, drug trafficking, exploitation and violence. Police and Crime Commissioner Clive Grunshaw supported the initiative and praised the results.""This sends a clear message: we will not tolerate organized crime in our communities. I remain committed to giving law enforcement the resources they need to take down these gangs and protect the public.""",A chatty parrot with a knack for drug slang has helped British police crack down on a prison drug ring.

The AI shift that opened doors

His secret to cracking big tech interviews

Advice for aspiring AI engineers





At just 23, Manoj Tumu has cracked the code many engineers spend years chasing - a $400,000 (Rs 3.36 crore) paycheck and a role at Mark Zuckerberg ’s Meta.The Indian-American software engineer swapped Amazon for the social media giant earlier this year, joining its advertising research team, and now he’s sharing the playbook behind his rapid rise.Tumu admits Amazon gave him a solid foundation, but the lure of Meta’s projects was irresistible. “Though I had learned a lot at Amazon, I just thought there was more interesting work going on at Meta,” he told Business Insider. When the offer landed in June, he didn’t hesitate.Tumu says the timing was perfect. Machine learning has transformed in recent years, shifting from human-driven “classical” techniques to deep learning, where neural networks crunch raw data automatically. “That change has opened up exciting opportunities,” he explained.If you thought referrals or flashy projects were the ticket in, Tumu disagrees. He revealed he got into both Amazon and Meta without a reference - just a “decent resume” and a lot of persistence. His advice? Ditch the college project section once you’ve gained two or three years of experience and focus on professional impact instead.And when it comes to interviews, he insists the behavioral round is where many stumble.“At Amazon, I went through six rounds of interviews. I studied the company’s values, wrote a huge document of stories and follow-ups, and tailored my answers for every principle,” he said. His takeaway: knowing the company’s culture is as important as knowing your code.For students, his golden rule is simple - grab an internship, no matter the pay. “Even low-paying internships can be beneficial. Experience matters more than money early on,” he said.Tumu, who started his master’s program in 2022, also swears by cold emails. Sending them helped him get his foot in the door — something he says aspiring AI professionals shouldn’t shy away from.","Manoj Tumu, 23, left Amazon for Mark Zuckerberg's Meta earlier this year.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.
