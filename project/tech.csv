How is India using AI as a soft power or diplomatic tool globally?



The Election Commission's 2024 AI content labelling advisories set a global benchmark for ethical AI in elections, noted by international media.

PM Modi's safe AI advocacy in G20 and bilateral talks (e.g., with US leaders) enhances India's image as a responsible tech power.

Bhashini's multilingual AI is being adapted for diaspora engagement, translating cultural content for Indian communities in the US and Gulf.

AI startups like Krutrim and Polymath Solutions, plus plans for India-specific AI models, position India as an innovation hub for the Global South.

As tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after the horrific Pahalgam attack on April 22, the nation witnessed a parallel war that erupted online — one that included not drones or missiles but manipulating pixels and synthetic voices.From AI-generated clipping of a newspaper falsely praising Pakistan's air force to deepfaked video of S Jaishankar offering fake apologies, public fell prey to misinformation created with help of Artificial Intelligence.The weaponisation of AI, particularly in times of elections or war, is not just a nuisance or prank; it's a calculated effort to sway voters or influence public sentiment. Even to distort facts.India, with tech-savvy population, is suffering the threat where mass-producing propaganda takes seconds, and it is no longer hypothetical but real, present, and dangerous.The threat isn't just reserved for wartime, it is increasingly creeping into India's democratic bloodstream.A prominent politician appears on your WhatsApp feed, making inflammatory remarks about a sensitive religious issue. The video spreads like wildfire across social media, triggering outrage and potentially swaying thousands of voters. There's just one catch – the politician never actually said those words.Welcome to the age of deepfakes, where seeing is no longer believing.While Artificial Intelligence offers powerful new tools for political campaigning and even diplomatic engagement, its rapid advancement also casts a long shadow – the rise of deepfakes and the potential for widespread digital deception. The very technology that amplifies a campaign's reach can also be weaponised to manipulate the truth, posing significant ethical challenges to the integrity of information and trust within India's democratic processes.In a conversation with TOI, Devesh Singh, a political communication strategist, said deepfakes are a serious threat, undermining electoral integrity through misinformation. In 2024:""Low digital literacy (76.32% adult literacy) exacerbates vulnerability, especially in rural areas. The Election Commission’s May 2024 advisory, mandating deepfake labelling and removal within three hours, lacks robust enforcement, and India has no specific AI laws. With deepfakes created in 2-3 minutes, their viral potential threatens hyper-local constituencies, risking trust erosion and potential unrest if unchecked,"" he added.Talking about deepfakes and morphed videos, a digital communication consultant, Keshav Mishra, said, ""these have been used to defame political opponents during elections. While digitally literate audiences can often identify AI-generated content, rural populations remain vulnerable to misinformation.""While explaining harm caused by fake AI-generated content, Singh said harmful AI content spreads rapidly, often outpacing takedown efforts. ""Misinformation spreads five times faster than corrections. A deepfake can reach tens of thousands in a day, underscoring the need for real-time monitoring and stricter platform accountability,"" he added.As domestic politics is adapting to AI, India's foreign policy is also evolving under its influence. Recently, the world went mad over Ghibli Art, and even politicians went gaga over it.For example, in the wake of Ghibli art, AI united two nations — India and Israel, through AI-generated images. The Israeli Embassy in India shared an image showcasing the friendship between PM Modi and Benjamin Netanyahu in a beautiful Ghibli-style art piece. The Indian Embassy in Israel also shared images of PM Modi driving a vehicle on the shores with Netanyahu enjoying his company.The artistic portrayal is an example of how the two countries are strengthening ties at a crucial time (the Israel-Gaza conflict).Apart from this, India is leveraging AI as a soft power tool on the global stage, from cyber diplomacy to multilateral tech partnerships.D uring AI Action Summit in Paris on February 11, 2025, PM Modi emphasised how ""AI is already re-shaping polity, economy, security and even society.""""AI is developing at an unprecedented scale and speed. And being adopted and deployed even faster. There is also a deep inter-dependence across borders. Therefore, there is a need for collective global efforts to establish governance and standards, that uphold our shared values, address risks, and build trust,"" he added.Highlighting India's tech-savvy youth at a global platform, he underlined the fact that India is building AI applications for public good. ""India is building its own Large Language Model considering our diversity. We also have a unique public-private partnership model for pooling resources like compute power. It is made available to our start-ups and researchers at an affordable cost. And, India is ready to share its experience and expertise to ensure that the AI future is for Good, and for All,"" he added.Cutting short, diplomacy is not just about defence, infrastructure, nuclear deals and trade tariffs anymore — it's also about tech stacks and AI models.Singh said India is leveraging AI to bolster its soft power, positioning itself as a tech governance leader:However, the lack of comprehensive AI legislation limits India's influence compared to the EU or the US. Still, its election AI experiments offer a model for democratic nations, strengthening its diplomatic narrative.Amid fears of AI working at the forefront and replacing jobs, a question arises: will it also replace politicians? Well, time will generate the code to decode the question. But now, we can say that AI might change how they win.With scale, diversity and digital ambition, India is positioned well to become a leader in ethical AI adoption. But, it is noteworthy that leadership won't come from tools alone.","Fake videos of Aamir Khan and Ranveer Singh endorsing Congress sparked police complaints, reaching millions via WhatsApp's 535.8 million users.

Every year, millions of Muslims from across the globe journey to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to perform Hajj — one of the five pillars of Islam and the most significant spiritual undertaking in a Muslim’s life. This year, the Hajj pilgrimage is not only a religious journey of devotion and reflection but also a remarkable feat of digital transformation and technological innovation. For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced a host of cutting-edge upgrades to ensure pilgrims can perform their rituals with ease, safety, and seamless connectivity. From the provision of free, high-speed internet to the deployment of AI-powered crowd monitoring systems and climate-controlled mosque environments, the Kingdom is leveraging advanced technology to modernize the pilgrimage experience at an unprecedented scale.This effort reflects the Kingdom’s broader Vision 2030 goals, which include transforming Saudi Arabia into a global hub for innovation while preserving its deep-rooted religious and cultural heritage. According to the Gulf News report, with over 10,500 WiFi hotspots, full 4G and 5G coverage, AI-driven safety systems, and even the world’s largest mosque cooling infrastructure, Hajj 2025 may be the most technologically advanced pilgrimage in Islamic history.One of the most talked-about innovations this year is the provision of free, high-speed internet access for all Hajj pilgrims. Saudi Arabia has installed more than 10,500 WiFi access points throughout the pilgrimage zones, including Mecca, Medina, Mina, Arafat, and Muzdalifah. This vast network eliminates the need for pilgrims to seek connectivity during their rituals or logistical movements.According to Saad Al Shanbari, spokesperson for the Hajj Communications and Technology System, the initiative aims to enhance both the spiritual and logistical journey of the pilgrims, as per the Gulf News report. “There’s no need to search for WiFi,” he stated. “Internet access is now available for all pilgrims, everywhere.”This connectivity not only allows pilgrims to stay in touch with family back home and access religious resources but also provides real-time updates, maps, and official communications directly from Hajj authorities.In tandem with the WiFi rollout, the Communications, Space and Technology Commission (CST) has achieved 100% 4G and 5G network coverage across all major Hajj sites. This includes high-density areas such as:This move ensures high bandwidth and low latency for millions of simultaneous users, accommodating massive data transfers, real-time video calls, and even live religious broadcasts to families and followers around the world.Saudi authorities report that over 4,000 telecom engineers and technical staff have been deployed to maintain and optimize service during peak Hajj days.Crowd management during Hajj is critical, given that millions of pilgrims converge in confined spaces, especially during peak rituals like the Day of Arafat or the symbolic stoning at Jamarat. For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced an AI-powered crowd control and safety monitoring system developed in collaboration with Aramco Digital.This system integrates:The AI monitors crowd flow in real time, identifies bottlenecks or high-density zones, and alerts authorities instantly to deploy crowd control personnel or reroute groups to avoid stampedes or accidents.Al Shanbari emphasized the real-time responsiveness of the system, saying, “We’ve deployed smart surveillance systems to manage crowd flows through AI-based monitoring and secure communications. The safety of pilgrims is our highest priority.”Another groundbreaking innovation is the world’s largest cooling system installed at the Grand Mosque in Mecca. As Hajj 2025 coincides with the peak of summer in Saudi Arabia, temperatures are expected to soar above 45°C (113°F). To combat this, the Kingdom has enhanced its centralized air conditioning infrastructure, using underground pipelines to pump chilled air across prayer halls and corridors.The cooling system comprises:This is a critical move for public health and comfort, especially for elderly and physically vulnerable pilgrims. Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah confirmed that this upgrade has already helped prevent numerous cases of heatstroke and dehydration during the initial phases of Hajj 2025.As part of the smart Hajj initiative, Saudi Arabia has also digitized its emergency response operations. Hospitals and medical tents near pilgrimage sites are now AI-integrated and GPS-synced, enabling faster triaging, emergency routing, and real-time coordination between ambulances and medical teams.An example of the system’s success emerged recently when an Egyptian pilgrim survived a heart attack and received immediate treatment thanks to the system's real-time alert and GPS tracking. He is now recovering and is expected to resume his pilgrimage after medical clearance.To tie everything together, Saudi Arabia has launched the Hajj Smart App, an all-in-one platform offering:This app is GPS-enabled and linked to the broader smart infrastructure, allowing pilgrims to navigate easily, even in dense crowds or unfamiliar areas.","For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced a host of cutting-edge upgrades to ensure pilgrims can perform their rituals with ease, safety, and seamless connectivity.

Redefining luxury at Monaco Grand Prix 2025

The 2025 Formula 1 Monaco Grand Prix weekend was a dazzling blend of racing, music, art, and luxury. As McLaren’s Lando Norris took his maiden victory on the iconic Monte Carlo circuit, the event became much more than just a race. Celebrities and elite guests including Jeff Bezos, Lauren Sanchez, Dua Lipa, Sofia Vergara, and Odell Beckham Jr. turned Monaco into the ultimate playground of glitz and glamour. From lavish yacht parties to exclusive art events, Monaco gave fans an extraordinary peek into the high life beyond the track.One of the weekend’s most talked-about activities was the debut of the RD Grand Prix, a three-day superyacht experience at Port Hercule. Hosting around a hundred VIPs, the 180-foot yacht combined live music, fine dining, and trackside viewing of the race. Robin Thicke opened with a private concert, followed by a surprise Sunday night set from DJ Rampa, who premiered new speakers to an electrified crowd including Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez.Created by Ben Biscotti and Sylvain Bitton, RD Grand Prix was designed to mix tech billionaires, royalty, and fashion icons with racing fans in a setting of unrivaled luxury. Guests enjoyed champagne on the rooftop bar, relaxed in an outdoor hot tub, shopped fashion pop-ups, and dined on cuisine by Michelin-starred chef Marc Forgione. Sponsors like RUMOR Rosé and Lewis Hamilton’s Almave spirit added to the upscale vibe. Biscotti says the goal is to “redefine luxury and experiential hospitality” by crafting unforgettable moments that blend entertainment and exclusivity.Just a short walk from the RD Grand Prix, NFL star Odell Beckham Jr. hosted his FRI&NDS activation aboard his private yacht. This event combined music, art, and philanthropy in an intimate, lively atmosphere. Guests like Devin Booker and Chanel Iman mingled as DJ HoneyLuv and Paperwater provided live music, while a curated art exhibit by Lisbon’s Underdogs Gallery showcased works by street artist Alexandre Farto (aka “Vhils”).The highlight was a collaborative concrete carving auctioned off by Beckham and Vhils, with proceeds benefiting Iminente’s Bairros project. This initiative empowers underserved Portuguese communities through art and education. Launched at the Super Bowl earlier this year, FRI&NDS aims to celebrate and support creative talent through cultural events tied to major sports and entertainment moments.Formula 1 driver Charles Leclerc also made a splash during the weekend, debuting a new capsule clothing line with Ferrari Style at Nikki Beach Monte Carlo. The rooftop venue offered stunning views of both the Mediterranean and the race’s famous Fairmont Hairpin. Leclerc mingled with fans as Ferrari’s signature red branding adorned the club in celebration of Nikki Beach’s 10th anniversary.This collaboration added a fashionable edge to the Grand Prix festivities and highlighted how Monaco continues to blend sport with luxury lifestyle in unique ways.The Monaco Grand Prix has always been synonymous with luxury and exclusivity, but this year’s events took it to new heights. From Jeff Bezos’ star-studded yacht party to Odell Beckham Jr.’s fusion of art and philanthropy, and Charles Leclerc’s stylish launch, Monaco 2025 was about more than racing. It was a celebration of culture, community, and elite experiences.Event producers Biscotti and Bitton have set the bar high for future activations, with their next major event, Rosé Day Los Angeles, coming up in June.

Today’s NYT Connections answers (June 6, 2025)



Explanation of the Connections

NYT Connections is back with another brain-teasing word puzzle for Friday, June 6, 2025. Today’s puzzle mixes a clever blend of journalism, scams, routine, and even a bit of canine wordplay. If you’re stuck or just curious about how everything fits together, we’ve got you covered with full hints, answers, and an explanation. From newspaper jobs to hidden dog names, today’s Connections puzzle will make you think twice about how you group your words. Let’s break down everything from gameplay basics to today's correct answers.Connections is a daily word game from The New York Times that challenges players to group 16 seemingly unrelated words into four distinct categories. The categories often involve word meanings, puns, pop culture references, or wordplay. Each group of four words has something in common, and only one correct solution exists per puzzle. The game’s growing popularity is due to its unique twist on logic, vocabulary, and lateral thinking.You’re given a grid of 16 words and need to sort them into four groups of four by identifying the hidden connection among them. The connections might involve word meanings, parts of a phrase, puns, or thematic links. Each group is color-coded by difficulty:Yellow – easiestGreen – mediumBlue – trickyPurple – most difficult (often includes wordplay)You have only four chances to get it right. Wrong guesses reduce your lives, and the game ends if you lose all four.Here’s a nudge in the right direction without giving everything away:Yellow: PhotographerGreen: RegularBlue: SwindlePurple: TrendsetterHere are the four correct groups:Yellow group – Newspaper jobsColumnist, Editor, Photographer, ReporterGreen group – EverydayCommon, Regular, Routine, StandardBlue group – What “con” might meanConvention, Criminal, Drawback, SwindlePurple group – Ending with kinds of dogsNewshound, Shadowboxer, Snickerdoodle, TrendsetterNewspaper jobs (Yellow): These are all roles typically found in a newsroom. Think Clark Kent and Peter Parker—superheroes by night, reporters and photographers by day.Everyday (Green): All these words describe something typical, usual, or frequently occurring.What “con” might mean (Blue): Each word relates to meanings or puns involving the prefix “con.” Convention as a gathering, Criminal as in con-man, Swindle as a scam, and Drawback as a “con” or disadvantage.Ending with dog types (Purple): This was the trickiest. Hidden at the end of each word is a dog breed or type:Newshound – HoundShadowboxer – BoxerSnickerdoodle – PoodleTrendsetter – SetterToday’s Connections puzzle was a real test of both language and logic, with clever puns and misdirection—especially in the purple group with hidden dog names. Whether you're in it for the wordplay, the daily mental stretch, or the fun of comparing results with friends, NYT Connections remains a fan favorite among word game lovers. Come back tomorrow for another round, and maybe, just maybe, you’ll spot the connections faster than ever before.","Connections is a daily word game from The New York Times that challenges players to group 16 seemingly unrelated words into four distinct categories.

iOS 26 expected updates

Apple will kick off its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday, June 9 at 1 PM ET (10:30pm IST), where it is expected to unveil its biggest operating system redesign since iOS 7, along with sweeping UI changes and updated names across its operating system platforms. According to rumours, the company may change the name system of operating systems. Instead of version number, operating systems will now be named by year. It means the update after the current iOS 18 will be iOS 26 rather than, say, iOS 19. Similar naming system may be introduced for other OS platforms as well.While artificial intelligence is expected to play a smaller role compared to recent tech industry trends, Apple is aiming to deliver long-requested improvements such as better window management for iPads and deeper personalization features. According to a 9to5Mac report, the company is working on practical updates to everyday apps such as Messages, Music, Notes, and CarPlay, offering a mix of AI-powered tools and design upgrades.Among the standout additions expected on the Messages app in iOS 26 is automatic message translation, powered by Apple Intelligence. This feature will allow real-time translation of incoming and outgoing texts, improving communication across different languages—similar to features already seen in apps like Google Meet.In Apple Music, the Lock Screen Now Playing view is rumoured to get an upgrade. The full-screen album art may feature an animated artwork, making for a more immersive experience directly on the Lock Screen—a small but polished touch that builds on recent UI improvements.As per the report, Apple Notes will also gain the ability to export notes in Markdown, a long-awaited feature for users who frequently move between Apple’s native app and third-party platforms.The 9to5Mac report states that the design refresh coming with iOS 26 will extend to CarPlay, bringing it in line with the broader Apple ecosystem’s updated visual language. Although the full scope of changes is unclear, it says that both regular and “Ultra” versions of CarPlay will receive visual updates.","Apple will kick off its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday, June 9 at 1 PM ET (10:30pm IST) The company is expected to unveil its biggest operating system redesign since iOS 7, along with sweeping UI changes and updated names.

Sharjah’s second mountain retreat





Far from the rolling vineyards of Tuscany or the sun-drenched slopes of southern France, grapevines are now thriving at 850 metres above sea level on the rocky, windswept slopes of Jebel Deem in Sharjah’s eastern mountains. In a landscape more known for its harsh terrain than fertile soil, the crescent-shaped Ghamam retreat has defied expectations, transforming rugged rock into a thriving vineyard, and this landmark moment unfolded at Ghamam, a new high-altitude development on Jebel Deem, where the UAE’s first mountain grape cultivation has just borne fruit.Named after the Arabic word for “ above the clouds,” the Ghamam project is part of a sweeping vision led by Sheikh Dr Sultan Al Qasimi, Ruler of Sharjah. More than 4,500 trees, including grape vines, olives, apples, and pomegranates — have been planted on the slopes of Jebel Deem as part of the emirate’s ambitious strategy to green the mountains and cultivate food in unlikely places. Photos and videos shared bythis week captured the harvest, a moment that is both a technical milestone and a symbol of what sustainable mountain agriculture could look like in the UAE.“Its unique location provides visitors with a panoramic view of the city’s coastline and surrounding mountain valleys, offering a captivating experience and holding significant cultural and social importance,” according to documentation from the Sharjah Ruler’s office.The agricultural breakthrough is only one part of the Ghamam retreat, a crescent-shaped mountaintop destination combining farming, tourism, and leisure.The site spans 4,700 square metres and features two floors that blend mountain hospitality with immersive visitor experiences.The development serves dual purposes: showcasing high-altitude farming in action and offering a space for cultural, social, and educational engagement.Located within the Kalba region, the project adds a new layer to Sharjah’s growing reputation as a destination for innovative development. Kalba has already launched major attractions such as the Hanging Gardens, Al Hefaiyah Lake, and a landmark clock tower, positioning the city as a leading eco- and agri-tourism hub.The Ghamam harvest complements this evolution by offering aexperience for visitors, blending scenic tourism with food sustainability.The initiative also supports Sharjah’s broader environmental and economic goals. By integrating agriculture with tourism, the project creates multiple revenue streams while promoting agricultural education and sustainable practices.Supporting this remote operation is a robust infrastructure network, including 10 kilometres of newly built roads and two bridges. One connects Wadi Al Helo Tunnel to the new Sharjah-Kalba Road, while another leads directly to the peak. These roads are built to accommodate both heavy agricultural vehicles and tourist buses, ensuring safe and efficient access.Future plans in the area include a FIFA-standard stadium on Mount Daym, located 650 metres above sea level, where temperatures are projected to be 10°C cooler than the city. Alongside it, a 100-room sports tourism hotel will rise, connected to the Ghamam retreat via a dedicated pedestrian path. These additions are part of a long-term integrated mountain development strategy combining sports, hospitality, and sustainability.The Ghamam project follows the success of Al Suhub Rest Area, Sharjah’s first mountain retreat, built 600 metres above Khor Fakkan and inaugurated in 2021. Together, the two projects underscore Sharjah’s pioneering role in mountain tourism and eco-conscious development.As the UAE works toward the goals of its National Food Security Strategy 2051, initiatives like Ghamam offer a blueprint for turning difficult terrain into productive, economically viable, and environmentally sensitive landscapes.","Ghamam is the UAE’s first mountain grape cultivation project.

Lisa Kaltenegger’s

Alien Earths

The Matrix’s





Tardigrades are little critters that were around before dinosaurs, and will eventually outlast us on Earth. They are so tough they can survive exposure to -272°C (cooler than liquid helium) and 150°C, which is quite a bit hotter than your pressure cooker. And Earth will be hotter than that in a few hundred million years – not entirely because of your car’s tailpipe emissions. As our Sun grows older, it will expand, making Earth hot like Venus with its middle-age spread. So, we should start planning our escape now. But where can we go?bookhas useful pointers for wannabe galactic hitchhikers. As the founding director of Carl Sagan Institute at Cornell University, Kaltenegger is an authority, but she’s got no recommendations, yet. Ideally, you wouldn’t want to travel too far because you are – asAgent Jones put it – “only human”. How long will you live – 100, 120 years? Unless you hit Star Trek’s fantastical ‘warp speed’ – faster than light – you can’t go far in that time. Voyagers 1 & 2 left Earth in 1977, and they won’t get close to another star for 40,000 years. So, space travel’s a bummer. Besides, space is mostly empty. Looking out the window will mean death by boredom. Step on the gas, and a 1mg speck of space dust could destroy your ship.So, speed and time are not on your side.Worse, your choice of space rock is a gamble. You have chosen it based on signs like the signature of its light, which tells you something about temperature on the planet’s surface and the materials you’ll find on it. Say, everything’s perfect, and this planet circles our Sun’s nearest neighbour, Proxima Centauri, which is about 40tn km away. You gather bag, baggage, family, and everything else that Moses took, and set sail on your ark. But…that light signal from Proxima took four years to reach Earth. Your data was already four years old. By the time you get there – cryofrozen, probably – in, say, 40,000 years, that planet may have ceased to exist. What then?The choice of your future home is complicated by other factors also, Kaltenegger shows. Maybe you’re looking too hard for an Earth-like planet and missing some gems. You want oxygen? Earth had precious little in its atmosphere till cyanobacteria appeared over 2bn years ago. They could split water, use hydrogen and free up oxygen. That’s how oxygen increased in air. If Earth formed at 12am, atmospheric oxygen touched 15% concentration only at 10pm. And now, a few seconds before midnight, it’s at 21%.So, by looking for ready oxygen, you might miss some good candidate planets. Likewise, searching only for a planet with green plants might be a mistake. Plants on Earth are green because sunlight is strong and they absorb its red and violet wavelengths, while reflecting the green. But on a liveable planet around a red star – whose light has less energy – plants may need to absorb all the available light. Hence, their leaves could appear black!Our next ‘Earth’ will definitely need some getting used to. There’s so much to figure out and fix. But we can’t do that if we make this Earth unlivable in the next decade or two. Have you checked your car’s tailpipe emissions?","As our Sun grows older, it will expand, making Earth hot like Venus.

Can high tech boost safety?

Less religion, more cyber





This year, it's drones featuring thermal imaging and robots handing out religious advice.A decade ago, it was all about the miracle of the mobile phone. And a century or so ago, the motor car was the highest of high-tech used during the annual Hajj pilgrimage.The Hajj, one of the largest gatherings of humans on Earth, is meant to be undertaken by every adult Muslim once in their lifetime. It will begin in Saudi Arabia on June 4 and end June 9. During those days, up to 2 million pilgrims from over 180 countries will take part in a number of different religious ceremonies in Mecca.But having so many people moving around in one comparatively small area has led to problems in the past. Thousands of pilgrims were killed in stampeding crowds in 1990 and 2015. Last year over 1,300 died due to extreme heat; pilgrims often walk up to 65 kilometers a day in 40-to-50 degrees Celsius heat. There have also been fires, protests, suicides, collapsing buildings and infectious diseases at the Hajj, as well as more everyday problems like people getting lost or having health problems.No wonder then that the Saudi authorities are trying to use technology to improve how they control crowds and cater to their visitors.This year, Saudi Arabia will use drones with thermal imaging as well as artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology to ensure that only those who have Hajj permits are allowed in.Last year's many deaths were mostly of pilgrims who didn't have official permission to be there and therefore couldn't access services like air-conditioned shelter in the extreme heat.To avoid overcrowding, Saudi Arabia's Nusuk website, also a mobile phone application, allows attendees to register to enter certain areas at allotted times. The Nusuk system includes an electronic identity card and a smart wristband, which hold information on the user's identity, travel plans, finances, health and accommodation, among other things. The Nusuk card must be carried throughout the pilgrimage and is used to access transport and other services. Some of the wristbands have location tracking, monitor the wearer's blood oxygen levels and heart rate, and can even be used to call for medical help.Other technological advances at this year's Hajj include robots to guide visitors around religious sites and to hand out water, Korans or offer advice in 11 languages. There are also newly paved, more reflective (and therefore cooler) streets, paths that minimize vibration for walking comfort, and a special white pilgrim's gown made from futuristic fabric that keeps the wearer up to 2 degrees Celsius cooler.All the technology, surveillance and advanced algorithmic calculation is meant to make the event safer and the chance of tragic accidents less likely. But as the amount of technology grows, so too do concerns about data privacy, state surveillance and potential cybercrime.""All of these technologies are mandatory and those who refuse them are not allowed to perform the pilgrimage,"" explains Zeinab Ismail, a researcher and editor at the Lebanon-based digital rights organization, SMEX. ""All of this, combined with Saudi Arabia's personal data protection law, which only partially aligns with international standards and contains concerning provisions and loopholes, raises increasing concerns about the safety and privacy of pilgrims' data. ""Saudi officials have argued that privacy concerns must outweigh safety at such a huge event.""Regardless of the [Saudi government's] justification, what worries me the most — and irrespective of the technology itself — is the fact that this technology is being deployed in a country where rule of law is weak, there's no transparency and no [state] accountability,"" argues Marwa Fatafta, policy director for the Middle East and North Africa at international digital rights organization, Access Now.It would be difficult to audit the technologies for problems and even harder for individuals to question their use, Fatafta told DW.""For the people who are going to the Hajj pilgrimage, they're not in any position to push back and say, 'I don't want to give my biometric data',"" she continued. ""So just the general context means that the door is wide open for abuse.""Reading the Nusuk app's terms and conditions, information about how long pilgrims' personal data can be kept is vague and even contradictory. DW e-mailed Saudi Arabia's National Data Management Office and the supervising Saudi Data and AI Authority to ask for more information on this. Both organizations publish e-mail addresses for the public to use if they have questions or want to make a complaint.Two DW e-mails received no response. Another bounced back with the message: ""Recipient's mailbox is full.""Since 2023, Saudi Arabia has had a personal data protection law — but as Ismail pointed out, ""the current legal framework … allows legislation to be interpreted or manipulated in ways that may serve state interests over human rights.""It's not just potential misuse of millions of pilgrims' data by local authorities causing concern. Higher dependence on technology to monitor and control Hajj pilgrims also means more vulnerability in general, as there are more places for hackers to attack. And Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states are already some of the biggest victims of cybercrime.The first platform Saudi Arabia used for registering pilgrims, Motawif, was run by a private company and unexpectedly sent spam to users. The state-run Nusuk app replaced it in 2022. The following year, cybersecurity experts found data submitted to Nusuk for sale on illicit websites that deal in stolen personal data.New technology has also brought another worry: Is all that high tech taking away from the once-in-a-lifetime spiritual relevance of the Hajj?A 2018 study conducted by researchers at the University of Central Lancashire in the UK suggested it might be.Pilgrims interviewed for the study complained about others taking selfies at holy sites, talking on the phone while performing rituals and behaving like tourists rather than pious visitors. ""Smartphones are the fourth devil in Hajj,"" one interviewee said, referring to a ritual featuring three representations of the devil.Some even complained all the technology was making the journey too easy.Where once pilgrims walked between holy sites, now they ride a high-speed train. And where once they stayed in simple tents, now they're accommodated in 10,000 air-conditioned, fire-resistant tents.""Since the Hajj has become 'high-tech,' the fundamental spirituality of the pilgrim's experience is arguably being transformed into something more akin to a 'cyber experience',"" the UK researchers wrote. Traditionally the Hajj is meant to be all about simplicity, spiritual purity and contemplative worship, they explained.As with every other kind of digital technology, high tech at the Hajj had its benefits and disadvantages, they concluded.","Saudi Arabia will use drones with thermal imaging and facial recognition to control Hajj crowds. Pilgrims will also wear smart wristbands that monitor their health and can call for help. But as the amount of technology grows, so too do concerns about data privacy and cybercrime.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121620942,imgsize-887447,width-400,resizemode-4/121620942.jpg"

Feud between Musk and Trump







A few days back, people were talking about the bromance between US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, but now their messy breakup has put the internet in front-row seats. Naturally, the memes came fast and furious.As the once-rosy relationship between Trump and Musk turned ugly in public on Thursday with exchanged insults and threats across their respective platforms, X and Truth Social. It all started with Musk criticing Trump over ""One Big Beautiful"" Bill.As they got engaged in ugly divorce, social media lit up with jokes and memes comparing the fallout to iconic feuds — from the backstabbing drama ofto the lyrical warfare between Drake and Kendrick Lamar.""The big beautiful bill led to the big beautiful breakup,"" one user quipped on X, Musk’s own platform, referencing the domestic policy dispute that triggered the clash. Anther posted, ""This is like Drake and Kendrick for republicans, the girls are fighting, Elon is crashing out!”The online discourse included ""Alien vs. Predator"" parodies and the familiar ""two monkeys knife fighting"" scene from ""The Simpsons"". Republicans Against Trump simply stated, ""I'm running out of popcorn.""Historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat cautioned against becoming too engrossed in the social media conflict: ""People, don't let the dramas of these out of control men distract you from the main developments. If Trump were serious he would order every single DOGE employee out of government. That has not happened. DOGE is embedded in over 30 government agencies/departments.""A notable post featured a disappointed sports enthusiast displaying a sign stating, ""I just hope both teams lose.""Trump and Musk, once political allies, are now embroiled in a public feud sparked by disagreements over the government’s 'One Big Beautiful' bill. Musk sharply criticised the legislation, calling it “a disgusting abomination” and urging Americans to “kill the bill.” In response, Trump expressed his disappointment, claiming he had cut Musk out of key EV policy decisions and stripped him of influence in Washington.","Trump and Musk are embroiled in a public feud sparked by disagreements over the government’s 'One Big Beautiful' bill.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.
