A generous move of Travis Kelce for Kansas City youth sparks debate on social media

Poll What do you admire most about Travis Kelce’s game? His clutch performances His powerful catches

Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce is no stranger to giving back, but his latest act of philanthropy is grabbing headlines for more than just its price tag. The tight end recently donated a $3.3 million home to Foster Love, a nonprofit working to support homeless youth in Kansas City. While many have applauded the move as a heartfelt gesture, the internet has exploded with speculation — with some fans claiming pop sensation Taylor Swift may have quietly financed the generous donation.The donation comes on the heels of a tough Super Bowl loss, but Travis Kelce’s influence off the field remains as powerful as ever. With a $17.1 million annual contract and an estimated net worth of $90 million, he’s got the financial means to make a serious impact. Still, not everyone is convinced the donation was purely altruistic.The controversy kicked off when fans began questioning the true origin of the funds. Some social media users speculated that Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce’s high-profile girlfriend, may have contributed — or even footed the entire bill. Theories range from Swift subtly backing the donation to the couple strategically making philanthropic moves to boost their public image. “Some fans assume that the singer paid,” read one line in a Marca report, igniting even more online chatter.Still, those close to the athlete say this isn’t out of character for him. Kelce founded the Eighty-Seven & Running foundation in 2015, focusing on underserved youth in both Cleveland and Kansas City. In 2024 alone, he donated 25,000 meals to students in need — a far cry from a one-off publicity stunt.Many are calling the donation a “classy act” and a reflection of Kelce’s long-standing commitment to social good. Others, however, suggest the timing and optics are too calculated. Tax benefits have also entered the conversation, with critics speculating the move could be financially strategic.Also Read: “Bizarre visuals”: Taylor Swift emoji rumors spark chaos as viral tweet dupes iPhone users with fake Apple update Despite the noise, Kelce's track record speaks volumes. His involvement with programs like Operation Breakthrough and direct contributions to education initiatives underscore a history of impact.

Taylor Swift’s influence shines as Travis Kelce makes $3.3 million donation to homeless youth in Kansas City

Pat McAfee opened up on Travis Kelce’s generosity while acknowledging Taylor Swift’s impact on his growing philanthropic presence. While Travis Kelce continues to make headlines as a Kansas City Chiefs superstar and a three-time Super Bowl champion, it’s his growing off-field legacy that’s earning admiration this week—one that’s closely tied to his high-profile relationship with Taylor Swift . The NFL tight end has made a powerful philanthropic move, donating $3.3 million toward a transitional home for homeless youth in Kansas City, and some are crediting Swift’s influence as part of the inspiration behind it.The 6,500-square-foot facility, built in partnership with the nonprofit Foster Love, will offer more than just a roof over young people’s heads. Designed with heart and purpose, the home includes six bedrooms, five bathrooms, a game room, a study area, a spacious kitchen, and outdoor features like a fire pit and garden. But more importantly, it will provide mentorship, education, and a sense of belonging to youth who are often overlooked.Pat McAfee, speaking on his ESPN show, didn’t shy away from connecting Kelce’s public image and his relationship with Swift to this generous gesture. “There are people that just naturally hate him because he's very popular, very famous,” McAfee said. “Especially now because he's dating the most popular and famous person in the world in Taylor Swift.”He emphasized that Kelce’s decision to invest in social good over luxury or personal gain should be celebrated: “So him giving back, making the world a better place, I think should be chatted about.” McAfee added, “He could have bought something for himself or his family but instead wanted to give it back to society.”Kelce’s charity work isn’t new. Through his 87 & Running Foundation, established in 2015, he’s long championed programs for underserved youth, focusing on education, leadership, and athletics. However, this latest donation feels like a deeper evolution—both in scale and intention.Also Read: Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon calls Taylor Swift’s ‘Exile’ performance an ‘out of body’ moment during Eras Tour reflection Swift’s presence seems to align with this transformation. Known for her own extensive philanthropic efforts, including recent multimillion-dollar disaster relief donations, she brings with her a culture of giving and a massive spotlight—one that may be encouraging Kelce to broaden his impact.In the end, this isn’t just about a donation—it’s about a growing legacy shaped by love, leadership, and the desire to give back.","Travis Kelce donated $3.3 million toward a transitional home for homeless youth in Kansas City.

NFL Rumors: Aaron Rodgers reportedly prefers Vikings over Steelers despite Tomlin connection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-rumors-aaron-rodgers-reportedly-prefers-vikings-over-steelers-despite-tomlin-connection/articleshow/120038440.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

Aaron Rodgers is weighing legacy versus fit as he eyes the NFC North for one last run

Vikings offer a legacy move, but JJ McCarthy may be in the way



Aaron Rodgers is once again at the center of NFL offseason drama, and this time, his decision could reshape the balance of power in the NFC North. While the Pittsburgh Steelers are considered the frontrunners in the race to land the four-time MVP, fresh reports suggest that Rodgers has his sights set elsewhere—specifically, the Minnesota Vikings.Although Rodgers has been linked to Mike Tomlin’s Steelers in what many believe would be a natural pairing, the quarterback reportedly finds himself drawn to the Vikings’ high-powered offense and young talent. The franchise finished 14-3 last season and boasts superstar wideout Justin Jefferson, whose precise routes have been described as “Picasso with cleats.”Rodgers has long admired Minnesota’s head coach Kevin O’Connell, describing him as a “synchronized QB whisperer.” Their mutual respect dates back years, and Rodgers seems to see something special in this Vikings system. “I’ve always respected Mike [Tomlin] from afar,” Rodgers acknowledged in December, “but Minnesota’s built different.”While Rodgers appears to favor a Minnesota move, the team’s recent decision to draft quarterback JJ McCarthy may block his path. O’Connell is playing it cool, stating, “We’re rolling with JJ… unless he faceplants.” Translation? Rodgers’ shot at wearing purple and gold may depend entirely on whether the rookie struggles out of the gate.Still, for Rodgers, who famously values self-reflection, this may be about more than schemes and stats. “Authenticity is everything. You want to be proud of the person in the mirror,” he once said. And perhaps Minnesota, a franchise ready to contend but still searching for its next legendary QB, offers that clarity.Over in Pittsburgh, Tomlin is reportedly all-in. Multiple meetings, extended calls, and an open-ended approach show his willingness to bring Rodgers into the fold. But with Mason Rudolph re-signed and wide receiver George Pickens waiting for a consistent QB1, the Steelers may not feel like the perfect match.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers is the NFL’s problem child — and the league just can’t seem to let go Their $32.9 million in cap space could be stretched to meet Rodgers' rumored $40 million price tag—but does Rodgers see them as contenders or pretenders? At 41, he’s not chasing contracts—he’s chasing legacy. And if legacy means owning the NFC North one more time, then don’t be surprised if Rodgers rides off in purple instead of black and gold.","Vikings offer a legacy move, but JJ McCarthy may be in the way.

Donald Trump’s 'death prediction' on April 12 in The Simpsons is going viral — but is it real,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/donald-trumps-death-prediction-on-april-12-in-the-simpsons-is-going-viral-but-is-it-real/articleshow/119979161.cms,"Donald Trump’s 'death prediction' on April 12 in The Simpsons is going viral

Did The Simpsons predict Donald Trump’s death? The truth behind the viral video

Viral Trump coffin scene from The Simpsons is AI-generated, not real

Similar incidents in the past

Why these fake predictions gain traction

Official response and fact-checking

In the digital age, viral videos and AI-generated content can blur the lines between fact and fiction. One of the latest topics gaining traction online involves a claim that the popular animated show The Simpsons predicted the death of former U.S. President Donald Trump on April 12, 2025. The video, shared across social media platforms, shows what appears to be a scene from the show depicting a Trump-like figure in a coffin surrounded by mourners—prompting many to speculate whether The Simpsons has once again made an eerily accurate prophecy.The popularity of The Simpsons and its history of making surprisingly accurate predictions—such as Donald Trump's presidency or the invention of smartwatches—have fueled the intrigue. However, as with many viral claims, it's important to examine the facts behind the video, verify its source, and understand whether there is any truth to the speculation.The video making the rounds claims to be a scene from The Simpsons showing a Donald Trump-like character lying in a coffin. The setting is somber, with political figures surrounding the casket, and the voiceover suggests that this represents Trump’s death on April 12, 2025. The timestamp and content are intended to reinforce the idea that the show predicted his death years in advance.Adding to the credibility for some viewers is The Simpsons’ reputation for making correct predictions about real-world events. However, this particular clip is not what it appears to be.According to Matt Selman, executive producer of The Simpsons, the specific scene shown in the viral clip never appeared in any episode of the series. In fact, there is no The Simpsons episode, old or recent, that features Donald Trump’s death or anything resembling the visuals used in the video.The image and footage in question have been confirmed to be photoshopped or AI-generated. In some versions, the words “R.I.P Donald Trump 1946–2024” appear, a telltale sign of digital manipulation. These visuals have been widely circulated on platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, and YouTube Shorts, often accompanied by sensational music and misleading captions designed to provoke emotional reactions and maximize engagement.This isn’t the first time fake content involving The Simpsons and Donald Trump has gone viral. Since at least 2017, manipulated clips and images have circulated purporting that the show foresaw Trump’s death. Many of these posts resurface following real-world events involving the former president.For instance, a similar fake image went viral following an assassination attempt on Trump in July 2024, falsely claiming that The Simpsons had shown his death in a previous season. Like the latest viral video, that image was also debunked by fact-checkers and producers associated with the show.The Simpsons has gained notoriety for seemingly accurate predictions, including Trump’s presidency (Season 11, Episode 17: ""Bart to the Future""), the 2012 discovery of the Higgs Boson particle, and the invention of devices resembling modern smartwatches. These accurate predictions have contributed to a belief among some viewers that the series is prophetic.However, the vast majority of these coincidences are either exaggerated, misunderstood, or—like the Trump death scene—fabricated. The show's vast number of episodes and its satirical nature naturally lead to scenarios that may eventually resemble real-world events. But that does not validate manipulated images or support predictions not backed by actual episodes.There has been no official confirmation from Fox or the creators of The Simpsons supporting the authenticity of the viral clip. Executive producer Matt Selman’s statements clearly refute any suggestion that such a scene exists in the show’s extensive catalogue. Independent fact-checking organizations have also debunked the claim, confirming that the video is digitally altered and not taken from any legitimate The Simpsons content.","A viral video claims to show a scene from The Simpsons showing a Donald Trump- like character lying in a coffin.

Apple’s much-anticipated smart home hub, initially slated for release this year, is now expected to launch in 2026, according to a report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The delay stems from engineering challenges with Apple Intelligence and Siri integration, which are central to the hub’s functionality.The smart home hub, envisioned as Apple’s answer to the Amazon Echo Show and Google Nest Hub, was designed to feature a 7-inch square display, a new operating system, and seamless integration with Apple’s ecosystem. However, internal restructuring and complications with Siri’s contextual AI capabilities have pushed back the timeline. Apple is reportedly considering rebuilding some features from scratch to ensure reliability and accuracy.Originally planned for a March 2024 debut, the hub’s launch was postponed to April and later to the fall. Now, Apple is targeting 2026, aligning the release with updates to Siri and Apple Intelligence.The smart display, described as resembling a square-ish iPad with a 6-inch screen, would serve as Apple's entry into a product category where competitors Amazon and Google have been present for years with their Echo Show and Nest Hub devices.According to previous Bloomberg reports, the device features a front-facing camera, speakers, and a built-in battery. It's designed to function as a central hub for controlling smart home devices, offering intercom functionality and FaceTime video communication.Despite the delay, Apple has progressed to advanced testing stages, with select employees now permitted to take the device home for evaluation and feedback. The postponement appears tied to Apple's struggles implementing its App Intents system, which would allow Siri to deeply integrate with both first-party and third-party applications and execute complex voice commands - functionality crucial for a smart home hub.","Apple’s much-anticipated smart home hub, initially slated for release this year, is now expected to launch in 2026.

Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Meanwhile, Travis Scott, who was invited as a special guest by Triple H, also launched some brutal attacks on The American Nightmare that left him severely injured.This action of Travis Scott did not go well among the fans and WWE Universe, and thus, he had to face massive backlash after the PLE event.Despite the controversy, it is being reported that Travis Scott is going to make a shocking return at WrestleMania 41.

Perhaps his appearance is being kept secret, but I’m not sure why, given that everyone would expect him to begin with.”Although The Rock's appearance is unconfirmed, it is believed that WWE will be keeping the comeback involvement under wraps, as his past in-ring appearances were very spontaneous, and that significantly helped the company in their creative direction.As for Travis Scott, he has been undergoing wrestling training at the school of a WWE legend.
