Meghan Markle stirs controversy in Nigeria with 'Windsor dress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/meghan-markle-stirs-controversy-in-nigeria-with-windsor-dress/articleshow/110037065.cms,"In her visit to Nigeria, Meghan Markle has once again become the center of online debate after being spotted in a dress subtly named ""Windsor"". The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, arrived in Nigeria this Friday, invited by the country's chief of defense staff for their first official visit.During their appearance at the Lightway Academy in Abuja, Meghan Markle chose to wear a backless, beige-colored maxi dress designed by Heidi Merrick, which is notably named ""Windsor"".This fashion choice quickly sparked reactions on social media, with one user commenting on X (formerly Twitter), ""Meghan Markle is desperate to have ties to Windsor name. Her strategic marriage and un-strategic moves since then have backfired. Like a dress with the name gives her the legitimacy that continues to elude her!"" Another user added, ""But they have been trying to erase the Windsors from their lives completely, but here comes Mrs. Sussex wearing a dress called ‘Windsor’, haha!!""As per a Fox News report, critics argue that the choice of dress signifies a longing for royal connections despite the couple's previous actions to distance themselves from royal duties. Some go as far as to say, ""She’s desperate for the benefits without the duty.""However, not all feedback was negative. Several supporters defended Markle, suggesting that the controversy might be overblown. One supporter argued, ""Honestly, I think people read too much into this stuff. She wears a dress and suddenly it's a secret message? Maybe she just liked the dress.""The visit also focuses on the Invictus Games, which saw Nigeria participate for the first time in September 2023. According to British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard, the trip aims to boost the couple's popularity, especially following their 2020 departure from royal duties. ""The couple needs positive PR as they are often reminded of their failures,"" Chard stated, noting their intent to maximize media coverage during their stay.Despite the mixed reactions, the visit carries the hallmarks of a significant public relations effort, blending royal ambiance with celebrity flair, aimed at garnering positive attention for their ongoing philanthropic endeavors.","The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, arrived in Nigeria this Friday for their first official visit.

Red flags: Be cautious of these warning signs

WhatsApp investment scams : Scamsters are using social media platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram to trick investors with the promise of fast money. They're creating fake investment groups , pretending to be famous brands and professionals, and offering phony stock tips and trading courses .According to ET, scamsters send group invitations to WhatsApp users, claiming to be from a well-known fund house.The messages promise free access to high-quality investment portfolios and daily stock recommendations as part of an online event celebrating the fund's anniversary in India.1. Victims are added to random WhatsApp investing groups.2. Multiple groups are created simultaneously.3. The profile of a famous investor and their credentials are shared with group members.4. Discussions begin in the group, with some members hyping up upcoming 'lessons' or 'opportunities'.5. Initial stock tips are shared for free, with conflicting tips shared in other groups.6. Some tips work in favor of certain groups, encouraging members to invest more.7. Less successful groups are abandoned.8. Active members are pushed to invest in special programs with promises of bigger rewards.9. If a victim refuses to invest more or tries to withdraw funds, their account is disabled, and the WhatsApp group is deactivated. Scammers vanish with the victims' funds.These scamsters employ a very common tactic to impersonate renowned fund managers, financial advisors , and influential figures within the finance community. By leveraging the identities of individuals like Porinju Veliyath and Ajay Kacholia, these fraudsters aim to lend an air of credibility to their operations, preying on investors' desire for lucrative stock tips, the financial daily’s report said.Santosh Joseph, Founder of Germinate Investor Services, was quoted as saying, “These scamsters prey on investors’ appetite for stock tips, particularly coming from star names.”They might pose as an investment academy or class, with a 'professor' or 'teacher' (often the impersonated individual). Discussions in group chats are often scripted, with members expressing excitement about upcoming opportunities or asking about the trading program. Usually, these active participants are affiliates who pretend to be genuine members, adding a false sense of legitimacy to the operation.Rahul Ghose, CEO of Hedged.in, says, “Messages planted by their own affiliates gives the entire set-up a feel of legitimacy.”Some scamsters even mention past trading successes under the 'teacher's' guidance, providing screenshots as evidence. This is to create a fear of missing out (FOMO) among unsuspecting members. They also create a sense of urgency by pushing a 'limited time opportunity' or warning of missing out on profitable trades. Another tactic is to offer investors a free 'trial' period to test the waters. Initial stock tips may be given for free to build confidence.Many of these scams operate as 'pump and dump' schemes. The scamsters or their associates convince people to buy stocks they already hold. They artificially inflate the stock price through circular trading. Once enough people buy, they sell their shares at a significant profit, causing the stock price to drop sharply. Other scams involve enticing people to transfer money in exchange for supposedly lucrative tips or recommendations. These tips are fake, so scammers create multiple investor groups, suggesting different ideas to each group.Ghose points out that different groups receive conflicting 'buy-sell' calls. Because some of these 'ideas' will succeed, members of those groups are pushed to invest more. Meanwhile, other groups are abandoned, and the cycle repeats.Investors should be cautious and watch for signs of fraud. If you receive a random invitation to join a trading community from unknown contacts, proceed with caution. Avoid falling for promises of quick wealth or guaranteed returns. As Santosh Joseph advises, ""Stay away from stock tips, no matter who shares them.""If an investing group claims affiliation with a trusted name or brand, verify its authenticity by reaching out to the person or company through social media or email, as recommended by Rahul Ghose. They're likely to identify any scam. Lastly, be wary of requests to send money through unverified links or download third-party apps, as these could be suspicious.","Scamsters are using social media platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram to trick investors with the promise of fast money.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Scenario 1 – Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction within the same billing cycle Purchase transaction date – October 15, 2023 As bill is yet to be generated in the given case, the refund amount received on October 19, 2023, shall be adjusted with other debits, prior to calculation of the Total Amount Due. Refund on October 19, 2023 - For cancellation of purchase dated October 15, 2023 Scenario 2 – Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction post generation of bill but before making payment of the dues Purchase transaction date - October 29, 2023 The bill is generated on October 30, 2023, however, the payment towards the dues has not been made till the date of refund. Therefore, the refund amount received on November 04, 2023, shall be adjusted towards the Total Amount Due (TAD) and accordingly the cardholder will be required to pay only the remaining outstanding (Remaining outstanding = TAD – Refund amount). Scenario 3 – Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction for which payment has already been made Purchase transaction date - October 30, 2023 As the cardholder has already cleared the dues, card-issuers shall seek explicit consent of the cardholder to adjust the refund amount in line with the provision stipulated at Para 10(h) of the MD. Payment towards dues – November 06, 2023 Case I - If the cardholder gives explicit consent, then refund amount shall be adjusted. Refund on November 07, 2023 - For cancellation of purchase dated October 30, 2023 Case II - If the cardholder does not provide the consent or no response is received for adjustment of the refund, then the refund amount will be credited to the bank account of the cardholder in line with para 10(h). Further, if the cardholder makes a request for crediting the refund (transaction for which payment has already been made), the same shall be credited back to the bank account of the cardholder irrespective of the cut off defined under Para10(h).

Scenario 2

Purchase transaction date: October 29, 2023

Refund or reversal occurs after the bill is generated but before the payment due date (November 19, 2023).

The refund amount will be credited to the cardholder's account and will reduce the outstanding dues to be paid before the due date.

Credit cards offer a convenient means to manage finances and enhance financial well-being. By using credit cards responsibly, individuals can build a positive credit history and improve their financial habits. It's important to use credit cards for expenses while ensuring timely repayment of debts to boost credit scores.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently introduced amendments effective from March 7, 2024, alongside releasing updated FAQs regarding credit and debit card issuance.One important question addressed in the FAQs is whether a credit card can be used beyond its sanctioned limit, with over-limit charges imposed, states an ET report. According to RBI guidelines, using a credit card beyond the approved limit (overlimit) necessitates explicit consent from the cardholder. Furthermore, cardholders must have the option to enable or disable the overlimit feature through various platforms provided by the card issuer. Without explicit consent, neither overlimit facilities can be extended nor overlimit charges levied.Here are some key FAQs derived from the Master Direction (MD) - Credit Card and Debit Card – Issuance and Conduct Directions, 2022:Card issuers cannot send credit cards without the customer's permission. If a customer gets an unsolicited card, they should not activate it or agree to its activation. If they don't consent, the issuer must close the credit card account within seven working days at no cost to the customer. The issuer will inform the customer about the closure. After that, the customer should destroy the card. If needed, the customer can complain to the issuer and escalate the issue to the RBI Ombudsman.If a cardholder fails to pay the total amount due by the payment due date, they will lose the interest-free credit period. Interest may be charged from the transaction date on the outstanding amount (adjusted for payments, refunds, or reversed transactions) and not the total due amount. Late payment fees and other charges will only apply to the outstanding amount after the payment due date, not the total amount due.Paragraphs 7(b) and 7(c) of the MD allow the issuance of different types of credit cards that can tap into the limits of various loan accounts. These cards are tailored to match the terms and conditions of the specific loan account. For instance, if a customer has an overdraft facility, they can receive a credit card to access the funds from that facility. The terms of use for this credit card, including interest rates, repayment schedules, penalties, and cash withdrawal limits, will mirror those of the overdraft facility.Additionally, paragraph 7(c) gives card issuers the flexibility to design Business Credit Cards according to their credit card policies. However, it's important to note that banks are not allowed to issue debit cards for cash credit or loan accounts.Which transactions can be used to reduce the amount owed and credited to the cardholder's bank account?In a standard credit card cycle from October 1, 2023, to October 30, 2023, assuming the bill is issued on October 30, 2023, and payment is due by November 19, 2023, here are the possible scenarios for adjusting credit:Activation of a credit card is confirmed through customer-initiated actions such as PIN generation, adjusting transaction controls, Interactive Voice Response, contacting customer care through recorded calls, or SMS communication. If the card remains inactive for more than 30 days from the date of issue, the card issuer must request One Time Password (OTP) based consent, as outlined in paragraph 6(a)(vi) of the MD.For business credit cards applied for by a corporate or business entity, card issuers must obtain explicit consent from the principal account holder, as specified in paragraph 6(a)(vi). Similarly, they must send notifications as per paragraph 8(b). This consent should come from the principal cardholder, unless otherwise stated in the agreement. Likewise, for retail credit cards, consent must be obtained from the principal cardholder, not from any add-on cardholders.Card issuers are not permitted to apply interest or other charges to unpaid taxes, levies, or charges. This provision, outlined in paragraph 9(b)(ii) of the MD, took effect from October 1, 2022. Therefore, card issuers cannot apply such charges to any unpaid taxes, levies, or charges billed from that date onwards.Regarding transactions eligible for adjustment towards outstanding dues and credited to the cardholder's bank account, let's consider a typical credit card billing cycle from October 1, 2023, to October 30, 2023. Assume the bill is generated on October 30, 2023, with a payment due date of November 19, 2023. Here are the different scenarios:- Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction within the same billing cycle:- Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction post-generation of bill but before making payment of the dues:","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently introduced amendments effective from March 7, 2024, alongside releasing updated FAQs regarding credit and debit card issuance.

However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109034604,imgsize-54266,width-400,resizemode-4/109034604.jpg"

EPF members can stop automatic EPF account transfers



EPF automatic account transfer : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) offers a convenient solution for its members when changing jobs: automatic transfer of EPF accounts . Despite its usefulness, this facility remains relatively unknown.As per an ET report, the automatic transfer simplifies the process for EPF members switching jobs , enabling them to seamlessly move their PF balances without the need for online or offline transfer requests.The transfer occurs automatically from the old employer to the new one, sparing members the hassle of managing the transfer themselves.Vaibhav Bhardwaj, a Partner at INDUSLAW, said that EPFO's automatic EPF account transfer has been operational since 2017.However, it's important to note that not all EPF members have access to the automatic transfer facility from old to new employers. It's only available for those whose EPF accounts are managed by EPFO. Exempted PF trusts are not included in this automatic transfer option.Gupta explains that if either the previous or current company operates a private provident fund trust, the auto-transfer feature will not function. A private PF trust oversees the provident fund contributions of employees within the respective company, rather than through the EPFO. However, it must still comply with EPFO regulations.Bhardwaj adds that EPF members transferring their old EPF account to a new EPF account, whether from EPF to an exempted trust or vice versa, or between exempted trusts, will need to apply for transfer using Form 13, either online or offline.The EPFO has set specific requirements for automatic EPF account transfers from old to new employers. These conditions, outlined in a November 2017 circular, include:(i) Matching UAN and Aadhaar numbers provided by the new employer with existing details in the UAN.(ii) Aadhaar number of the EPF member must be linked and verified with the UAN at their previous workplace.(iii) Availability of EPF member's details such as date of joining, date of exit, and reason for exit from the old employer.(iv) Activation of EPF member's UAN, with a registered mobile number.Bhardwaj further explains that when an employee starts a new job and receives their first month's provident fund contribution from the new employer, an automatic transfer is activated. This triggers the transfer of the EPF member's previous provident fund dues to their new account.Once the process is triggered, an SMS and email notification inform the member about the initiation of the auto transfer.Sandeep Agrawal, Director and Co-Founder of Teamlease Regtech, said that for automatic transfer claims, there's no requirement to submit Form 13. However, if the automatic transfer doesn't occur within the specified time due to issues like mismatched dates of exit, not updated exit dates by a previous employer, member details mismatch, or pending UAN Aadhaar seeding, members can opt for online Form 13 to transfer EPF and EPS accumulation from the previous employer to the present one.Once an EPF member receives SMS and email notifications regarding the auto transfer of their EPF account, they should verify if the transfer has been successful.Puneet Gupta, Partner at People Advisory Services EY India, mentions that the auto transfer process will only be finalized if the member doesn't request to stop it within 10 days of receiving the notification, either online, through the employer, or at the nearest EPFO office. Additionally, the transfer will be completed after the first contribution from the new employer is deposited and reconciled.The automatic EPF transfer follows a similar process to manual requests. Experts suggest that it may take 2-3 weeks for the automatic transfer to complete.Sandeep Agrawal adds that members can confirm the transfer by checking their passbooks. By logging into the unified portal and navigating to 'View Passbook,' members can see a credit entry if their PF has been successfully transferred.EPF members have the option to halt automatic transfers if they prefer. They can do so within 10 days of receiving the SMS notification about the auto transfer initiation. This can be done online via the Member e-Sewa portal or offline through their current employer or by visiting the nearest EPFO office.Gupta has mentioned the steps for stopping the automatic transfer online:1. Log in to the EPFO Member portal.2. Navigate to the ""Online services"" tab and select ""Track claim status.""3. Choose the option ""Stop auto-initiated claim cases.""If the auto transfer request has been triggered, it will appear under ""Stop auto-initiated claim cases,"" providing the option to halt the transfer. After stopping the EPF transfer, the member will receive communication via SMS to the mobile number linked to the UAN and the registered email address.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) offers a convenient solution for its members when changing jobs: automatic transfer of EPF accounts.

New NPS rule from April 1 : The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has enhanced National Pension System (NPS) security by adding a new layer called two-factor Aadhaar authentication . Starting April 1, all users logging into the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) system with passwords must use this feature, as per the PFRDA circular dated March 15, 2024.According to ET, using two-factor authentication greatly lowers the risk of unauthorised access to the CRA system . This added layer ensures the safety of NPS transactions and protects the interests of subscribers and stakeholders.The login process for NPS CRAs is changing. Following the circular, Aadhaar-based authentication will now be combined with the current user ID and password login system. This update enables access to the NPS central record-keeping agency (CRA) system through two-factor authentication.Here's how to log in to NPS using 2-factor authentication:1. Visit the NPS website: https://enps.nsdl.com/eNPS/NationalPensionSystem.html2. Click on 'Login with PRAIN/IPIN.'3. Select the PRAIN/IPIN tab, and a new window will open.4.

This authentication method will be integrated with the existing User ID and Password login system, enabling 2-factor authentication to access the CRA system.Government sector nodal offices can employ Aadhaar OTP for 2-factor authentication on the CRA and NPSCAN systems. To begin Aadhaar Mapping, the Oversight Office (PrAO/DTA) must initially link Aadhaar with the respective CRA User ID. PAO/DTOs must also link their Aadhaar with their CRA User ID to enable DDOs to initiate Aadhaar linkage.Government and autonomous bodies are required to implement Aadhaar-based login and authentication within the CRA system for NPS operations.","The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has enhanced National Pension System (NPS) security by adding a new layer.

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

ChatGPT is soon getting ‘eyes and ears’. OpenAI has launched GPT-4o – its latest flagship model that is touted to be much better than any existing model at understanding and discussing the images that users share. As per the company, GPT-4o provides GPT-4-level intelligence but at a much faster pace. It gets improved capabilities across text, voice, and vision.Think of ChatGPT powered by GPT-4o model – it pretty much works in a conversational way just like Google Assistant and Apple Siri in a human-like voice but gets the prowess of the familiar ChatGPT that people use in their everyday life.OpenAI announced that it is rolling out GPT-4o to ChatGPT Plus and Team users, with availability for Enterprise users coming soon. Additionally, those who use the free version of ChatGPT will also get to use the flagship AI model but the access will be limited.Those with Plus subscription will have a message limit that is up to 5x greater than free users, and Team and Enterprise users will have even higher limits. Those interested can download the app on their Android smartphones and iPhones.GPT-4o essentially brings voice and vision capabilities to ChatGPT. Previously, ChatGPT used to converse only in the text format; GPT-4o provides the AI chatbot the ability to speak in a natural way. For example, users can take a picture of a menu in a different language and talk to GPT-4o to translate it. They can also learn about the food's history, significance and even get recommendations.“In the future, improvements will allow for more natural, real-time voice conversation and the ability to converse with ChatGPT via real-time video,” the company said.During the live event, OpenAI CTO Mira Murati demonstrated how people can talk to the chatbot like the way it is done with Google Assistant and Apple Siri. She uses, “Hey, ChatGPT..” to invoke the chatbot and asks a question in Italian, which ChatGPT responds to in English in real time.OpenAI says it plans to launch a new Voice Mode with new capabilities in an alpha in the coming weeks. ChatGPT Plus users will get early access.ChatGPT with GPT-4o is getting improved language capabilities in terms of quality and speed. ChatGPT also now supports more than 50 languages across sign-up and login, user settings, and more. These also include various Indian languages: Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu.Murati also demonstrated that apart from different languages, the AI chatbot can also bring emotions and voice modulation.

Bluetooth tracker companies on board

Apple and Google join forces to protect users from unwanted tracking with Bluetooth devices.Starting this week, iPhone and Android users will receive alerts if an unknown Bluetooth tracker appears to be following them. This initiative comes after growing concerns about the misuse of trackers like Apple's AirTags for stalking purposes.Google and Apple have collaborated on an industry standard called ""Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers."" This standard will be implemented through software updates: iOS 17.5 for iPhones and an update for Android phones running version 6.0 or later.The update will trigger an ""[Item] Found Moving With You"" alert on your phone if an unfamiliar Bluetooth tracking device is detected traveling with you for a prolonged period. This alert will appear regardless of the device brand of the tracker.This move comes after several incidents where AppleAirTags were misused for stalking. In response, Apple and Google announced their collaboration last year to develop a solution for unwanted Bluetooth tracking.While AirTags were initially intended to help locate lost items like keys, they were unfortunately adopted by some individuals for malicious purposes. To address this concern in 2021, Apple released a ""Tracker Detect"" app for Android users. This app helped identify unexpected AirTags in their vicinity. The new industry standard announced this week takes a more comprehensive approach by integrating the solution directly into the operating systems.Several Bluetooth tracker companies, including Chipolo, eufy, Jio, Motorola, and Pebblebee, have already committed to making their future products compatible with this new standard.Apple and Google plan to continue working with the Internet Engineering Task Force to further develop the official standard for this technology. This collaboration signifies their commitment to user privacy and safety in the digital age.","Google and Apple have collaborated on an industry standard called ""Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers"" This standard will be implemented through software updates: iOS 17.5 for iPhones and an update for Android phones running version 6.0 or later.

From Google Developer Day to Google I/O

Evolution to Google I/O

Google's biggest annual event, the I/O developer conference, is happening today. CEO Sundar Pichai will begin his keynote speech at 10 AM PT (10:30 PM IST). Regarding what to anticipate at Google I/O 2024, the event typically presents innovative developments from Google spanning Android, Chrome, Google Assistant, AI, and other areas.Google will broadcast the keynote and other key sessions of Google I/O 2024 live on its official YouTube channel.You can watch the livestream via the following link on YouTube:Furthermore, have you ever wondered about the meaning behind Google I/O and how it came to be named? Read on to find out.In a blog post, Google delves into the intriguing origins of the name ""I/O"" for its annual developer conference, Google I/O. The post offers two primary explanations behind the name, shedding light on the event's conceptual foundation.One of the explanations posited by Google is that ""I/O"" stands for ""input / output,"" a fundamental computational concept representing the interaction between a computer system and its external environment. This definition aligns with the conference's focus on showcasing advancements and innovations in various technological domains like Android, Chrome, Google Assistant, and AI.Another interpretation suggested by Google is that ""I/O"" represents ""innovation in the open,"" underscoring the event's commitment to fostering collaborative and transparent innovation within the developer community.According to the blog post, both interpretations are valid, but the backstory goes deeper. Google traces the roots of I/O back to its inaugural developer conference, Geo Developer Day, held in May 2006.Lorin Platto, director of events and experiences operations and one of the original I/O event organisers, reminisces about the event's evolution. The first event in 2007, initially named Google Developer Day, attracted 1,000 developers at the San Jose Convention Center, focusing on the debut of Google's first publicly accessible developer tool, the Google Maps API.As Google's suite of developer tools expanded over the subsequent year, the need arose for a more comprehensive event to showcase products and engage with a burgeoning developer community. Hence, Google I/O was conceived.In 2008, the event transitioned to a larger venue, the Moscone Center West in San Francisco, coinciding with its official adoption of the ""I/O"" moniker. Lorin Platto shares insights into the name's numerical roots, deriving inspiration from a ""googol,"" a term that signifies the number 1 followed by 100 zeroes, akin to Google's namesake.""Taking the first 'one' and 'zero' from a googol, we crafted the 'I/O' name and logo,"" Lorin explains. The ensuing brainstorming sessions led to conceptualising ""input / output"" and ""innovation in the open"" as emblematic slogans for the event.Google's annual I/O developer conference thus encapsulates a rich history intertwined with the company's ethos of technological innovation and developer engagement. Through its diverse offerings and community-driven approach, Google I/O continues to serve as a beacon for open collaboration and forward-thinking initiatives within the tech industry.","Google will broadcast the keynote and other key sessions of Google I/O 2024 live on its official YouTube channel.

What's in for the developers

Google's annual developer conference, Google I/O 2024 , will kick off on May 14 with a keynote address that promises to showcase the tech giant's latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), Android updates, and some new hardware.Building upon last year's AI-centric event, Google is expected to double down on its AI initiatives, focusing strongly on its Gemini platform.Gemini, Google's answer to OpenAI's ChatGPT , will likely take centre stage as the company demonstrates new features and capabilities that could further enhance the AI chatbot we know today.While AI steals the spotlight, Google won't forget its roots in mobile technology. Attendees can expect a deep dive into Android 15, the latest version of Google's mobile operating system. With the first Android 15 beta already in the hands of developers, Google is poised to unveil a host of new user-facing features designed to enhance productivity, privacy, and security. Android 15 promises to deliver a more polished and efficient mobile experience, from improved notification management to a more refined user interface.Although Google I/O is primarily a software-focused event, the company has been known to surprise audiences with hardware announcements in the past. This year, the Pixel 8a has already been unveiled ahead of the conference, but that doesn't mean Google is out of tricks. Whispers of a potential Pixel Fold 2 or even a teaser for the upcoming Pixel 9 series have been circulating, leaving tech enthusiasts eager to see what Google has up its sleeve.We might also see some new Nest hardware make it to the main stage. A new chromecast, possibly a ‘Pro’ one.In addition to the headline-grabbing announcements, Google I/O 2024 is expected to showcase updates and improvements across the company's vast ecosystem of products and services. From enhancements to Google Maps and Google Workspace to advancements in WearOS and smart home technology - we could hear about the new upgrades coming to them. But, at the end of the day, it’s going to be all about AI.The keynote is what most normal people focus on, but the I/O is a developer galore. Developers can look forward to a wealth of sessions, workshops, and resources designed to help them leverage the latest technologies and best practices in their projects. Whether it's harnessing the power of AI, optimising for Android 15, or integrating with Google's ever-expanding suite of tools, developers are in for new technologies to play with.With AI poised to take centre stage and Android 15 promising a new era of mobile innovation, Google seems ready to set the tone for the coming year at the I/O 2024.","Google's annual developer conference, Google I/O 2024, will kick off on May 14.

Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max: 4 new camera features Apple may add to iPhone 16 Pro models,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/4-new-camera-features-apple-may-add-to-iphone-16-pro-models/articleshow/110057298.cms,"Upgraded ultra-wide cameras



Tetra-prism lens for iPhone 16 Pro



Improved lens flare control



New Sony primary sensor for improved low-light photography



Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 16 series later this year in September. The upcoming lineup may include four smartphone models -- the iPhone 16, the iPhone 16 Plus, the iPhone 16 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The Pro variants in the upcoming iPhone lineup are rumoured to bring new features like larger displays, a dedicated Capture button and more.According to a recent report by 9to5Mac, the Cupertino-based tech giant is also expected to add multiple noticeable improvements to the camera hardware of the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max models. Here are four new camera upgrades that may arrive with iPhone 16 Pro smartphones:Rumours suggest the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max may get an upgraded 48MP Ultra Wide camera this year. This is expected to be a major improvement from the current 12 MP Ultra Wide camera in the iPhone 15 Pro models.This upgrade is expected to offer improved performance in various shooting scenarios, particularly in low-light conditions. Images captured with the new Ultra-Wide camera are likely to show greater details and enhanced colour accuracy. The higher resolution will also provide increased flexibility during editing and post-processing.Furthermore, the 48MP Ultra Wide camera in the iPhone 16 Pro may also lead to significant advancements in spatial video recording. This feature, which utilises both the Main and Ultra Wide lenses, may enable the iPhone 16 Pro to record spatial video in 4K resolution. To compare, the iPhone 15 Pro is limited to recording spatial video at 1080p resolution.The current iPhone 15 Pro Max features a new tetra-prism camera design which offers 5x optical zoom and 25x digital zoom capabilities. With the upcoming iPhone 16 lineup, Apple is reportedly planning to extend this upgraded tetra-prism camera to the smaller iPhone 16 Pro model as well. This means both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will offer at least 5x optical zoom and 25x digital zoom.Rumours also suggest that the iPhone 16 Pro Max might feature a “periscope ultra-long telephoto combination.” This technology could potentially enable optical zoom greater than 5x.A common issue faced by most iPhone users is capturing lens flare while shooting in bright lighting conditions. This results in unexpected artefacts and internal reflections showing on images. While this problem is prevalent across most cameras on the market, Apple is reportedly working on a solution for the iPhone 16 Pro.According to rumours, Apple is testing a new ""atomic layer deposition"" (ALD) lens coating technology for the iPhone 16 Pro models. This anti-reflective coating could be applied to the iPhone 16 Pro's camera lenses to reduce the impact of internal reflections.If this rumour is true, users can expect fewer unexpected artefacts in images captured with the iPhone 16 Pro, particularly in bright lighting scenarios.The iPhone 16 Pro is expected to feature a new main camera sensor from Sony, which is designed to improve low-light performance.As per the report, Sony's latest stacked sensor technology separates the photodiodes and pixel transistors (which are usually combined into a single layer). This separation will allow the photodiodes responsible for capturing light to be significantly larger within the same overall pixel size.Sony claims that this new sensor will capture twice as much light as existing camera sensors. The increased light capture and reduced noise are expected to offer improved photos for iPhone users in all conditions.However, it remains uncertain whether this next-generation Sony sensor will be utilised in both iPhone 16 Pro models. A tipster on the Chinese social media platform Weibo suggested that only the iPhone 16 Pro Max may feature this upgraded stacked camera sensor hardware.","Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 16 series later this year in September.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 may get an AI-powered health update,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-may-get-an-ai-powered-health-update/articleshow/109969985.cms,"AI to convert PPG signals into ECG signals

Samsung is reportedly working on a feature that will use artificial intelligence ( AI ) to detect AFiB (Atrial Fibrillation). The South Korean tech giant has reportedly filed a patent for the same. It is likely that the feature may come with the next generation Galaxy Watch.AFiB is an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can lead to blood clots, strokes and other heart conditions.Over the years, health features have become dominant features on smart wearables, especially smartwatches. Apple introduced its ECG app in 2019 with Apple Watch Series 4 to alert users of irregular heart beats or AFiB. Samsung also allows users to record and monitor ECG (electrocardiogram) data to track heart’s rhythm and health.So then why the need for a new method?Because Samsung seems to believe that the current methods of monitoring are not necessarily accurate.The new patent filed by Samsung suggests that it aims to detect AfiB with the help of generative AI . With the help of AI, photoplethysmograph (PPG) signals will be converted into ECG signals. A PPG signal has several components including volumetric changes in arterial blood which is associated with cardiac activity. It measures the amount of light absorbed and reflected by human tissues.Meanwhile, Samsung is planning to launch a new premium smartwatch. In the financial report for Q1, 2024, the company revealed that it will launch a new premium smartwatch model which will join the Galaxy Watch 7 series.“For smartwatches, the MX Business will strive to meet demand for upgrades through the launch of new premium models,” mentions the company.Although the report didn't specify the exact release date or offer further details, it mentions that the desired upgrades requested by users will be incorporated into the higher-end models.Recent online rumours suggest that Samsung may launch three models of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 7 series.

A captivating romance can uplift anyone's spirits, and anime has a unique ability to vividly portray these narratives. Over the years, Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light-hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.For romance enthusiasts, going through so many anime options can be overwhelming. However, there are several exceptional romance anime series that truly shine above the rest.Here is a curated list of top romance anime series , compiled by Game Rant, along with their respective rankings.Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie stirred mixed reactions upon its debut in Spring 2022, often compared to ""My Dress-Up Darling"" but standing out as a unique slice-of-life anime centred around a charming couple, Shikimori and Yuu Izumi.One distinctive aspect of the series is its portrayal of the main couple already in a relationship, a rarity in anime. While the episodes focus on everyday moments, they paint a wholesome picture of young love with two endearing characters navigating the nuances of romance.Describing Bakemonogatari as a straightforward romance might be a stretch, but this instalment of Monogatari indeed focuses on and highlights the relationship between Koyomi Araragi and Hitagi Senjougahara. Their initial interactions are unconventional, involving a stapler to the face, but Araragi's determination to assist Senjougahara with her curse ultimately brings them closer.Despite the surreal and eccentric nature of Monogatari, the romance between Araragi and Senjougahara is remarkably grounded and healthy. While the series introduces other potential romantic interests, their relationship remains steadfast and central to the narrative.""Sing 'Yesterday' for Me"" presents romance in a refreshingly realistic manner compared to many other anime. The series takes a classic love triangle and steers it in an unexpected direction by the end, resulting in a highly satisfying conclusion that portrays how failed romances can evolve into strong friendships.Directed by Yoshiyuki Fujiwara, known for his work on popular anime like ""Attack on Titan"" and ""Sword Art Online,"" the shift to a show with such a different tone demonstrates his versatility and mastery in storytelling across diverse genres.""My Happy Marriage"" emerged as one of the standout romance anime of Summer 2023, adapted from Akumi Agitogi's novel series. Set in an alternate Meiji Restoration era with supernatural elements, the story follows Miyo, who endures mistreatment from her stepfamily despite her privileged background. Her family arranges her marriage to a notorious military figure known for rejecting wives quickly, with rejection spelling disaster for Miyo. However, Kiyoka surprises everyone by taking an interest in Miyo and becoming incensed by her family's cruelty.The anime delves into the lasting impact of Miyo's abuse, highlighting her struggle to regain self-worth, even with Kiyoka's support. Kiyoka himself is a complex character with hidden motives behind his initial attraction to Miyo, although his feelings for her are genuine.While the romance between Miyo and Kiyoka is heartwarming, ""My Happy Marriage"" falls short in other areas. The supernatural elements can seem disjointed, and the villains are one-dimensional despite being detestable.Based on Fumita Yanagida's popular and finished manga, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" stood out as one of Winter 2023's most amusing romantic comedies. Tomo and Jun share a close friendship, but Jun sees Tomo strictly as a friend, unaware of her romantic feelings.While romance is central to its characters, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" leans heavily into comedy. Tomo and Jun's dynamic is charming, and they're supported by entertaining characters like Misuzu and Carol. Despite its comedic tone, the chemistry between Tomo and Jun develops convincingly over the season. Unlike some romance anime, Tomo-chan excels in portraying why its leads are compatible without difficulty.Teen romance anime often dominate the genre, but there are exceptions worth noting. ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" is primarily a workplace comedy that revolves around two couples: the newly formed pair of Hirotaka Nifuji and Narumi Momose, and the more established couple, Tarou Kabakura and Hanako Koyanagi. The focus remains on Hirotaka and Narumi, with the series emphasising humour over romance, but Tarou and Hanako's relationship is depicted realistically.Despite being childhood friends, Narumi struggles to see Hirotaka as a potential romantic interest, a dynamic that persists throughout the series. The anime's brevity limits the depth of these relationships, but ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" provides an entertaining journey within its runtime.""Romantic Killer"" cleverly parodies romance and harem anime while paying homage to their core strengths. Anzu, a girl with no interest in boys, is suddenly thrust into a reverse harem scenario by a magical being, disrupting her life of gaming and chocolate consumption. Unamused by her newfound romantic entanglements with unfamiliar guys, Anzu navigates this unconventional situation with scepticism.Primarily a comedy, ""Romantic Killer"" aims to elicit laughter from its audience, often succeeding with its humour rooted in its origins as a shonen manga, characterised by exaggerated facial expressions.Though not always aiming for emotional depth, the anime treats its characters and their relationships seriously. Anzu shines as a compelling lead, and the male characters introduced as potential partners are well-developed. ""Romantic Killer"" offers a delightful blend of humour and romance for those seeking an entertaining and unconventional love story.""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" captivates viewers from the start for several reasons. Firstly, Project No.9's animation is impressive, featuring clean and detailed character designs. Secondly, and most importantly, the main characters exhibit instant chemistry, evident when Amane offers his umbrella to a soaked Mahiru, sparking a connection.Throughout the series, despite the frequent presence of both leads on screen, ""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" effectively delves into their individual personalities while also developing their friendship.Rumiko Takahashi is celebrated as a legendary mangaka, known for classics like Inuyasha, Ranma 1/2, and Urusei Yatsura. While most of her renowned works fall within the shonen genre, Takahashi has also ventured into seinen storytelling. Maison Ikkoku stands out as one of her most mature works, emphasising romance as its primary theme.Unlike Takahashi's prominent shonen series that explore various genres such as comedy and action alongside romance, Maison Ikkoku focuses squarely on romantic elements, enriched with drama, character development, and humour.The central relationship features Kyouko and Yuusaku, both drawn to each other but hindered by their circumstances. Kyouko, grieving the recent loss of her husband, is hesitant to move forward. Meanwhile, Yuusaku, deeply in love with Kyouko, doubts his worthiness as a student. The anime chronicles their journeys of growth, healing, and mutual misunderstanding, complemented by well-developed secondary characters.Insomniacs After School emerged as the standout romance of Spring 2023, adapted from Makoto Ojiro's esteemed seinen manga. The story revolves around two students plagued by insomnia, a burden they carried alone until they met at their school's observatory. Isaki and Ganta form an immediate bond, which deepens as they work together to revive the Astronomy Club, driven by their shared need to preserve their newfound sanctuary.The anime boasts impeccable pacing, skillfully depicting the protagonists' isolation due to insomnia and the subtle solace they find in each other.

The story centers around Taichi, Iori, Yui, Yoshifumi, and Himeko, students of the Student Cultural Research Club, whose lives take a turn when they receive supernatural abilities from a mysterious being named Heartseed.As they grapple with these newfound powers, the group experiences sensory phenomena that challenge their relationships and reveal hidden aspects of their personalities. The anime is rich in character development, providing an engaging and thought-provoking experience.Maid Sama! carries many tropes that might derail other romance anime: an overly perfect male lead, a strong female protagonist reduced to a damsel, and an unnecessary love triangle. Despite these shortcomings, Maid Sama! shines through its strong personality.The heart of Maid Sama! lies in the relationship between Takumi Usui, a charming heartthrob, and Misaki Ayuzawa, a strict student council president with a busy schedule balancing school, home, and work. When Takumi discovers Misaki's secret job at a maid cafe, it opens a new perspective on the usually composed president.In ""Rascal Does Not Dream Of Bunny Girl Senpai,"" romance plays a subtle yet compelling role that defines the series. The story centers on Sakuta Azusagawa, a high school student drawn to girls suffering from Adolescence Syndrome, a condition linked to their insecurities.While the anime unfolds through different arcs focusing on various girls, the standout is the initial saga featuring Mai Sakurajima, an actress who forms a close bond with Sakuta. Their dynamic crackles with romantic tension, warmth, and clever banter. Although not always in the foreground, their relationship develops steadily across subsequent arcs, leading to a satisfying sequel in the form of a feature film.Wakana Gojou and Marin Kitagawa inhabit completely contrasting worlds.

""My Dress-Up Darling"" is a charming, humorous, and beautifully animated romance anime that excels in executing classic genre tropes with finesse.""Toradora!"" is a beloved slice-of-life romantic comedy that offers a wonderful entry point into the genre. The story revolves around Ryuji Yusaku and Taiga Aisaka, two students who have crushes on each other's best friends.Both Ryuji and Taiga are viewed as outcasts—Ryuji due to his intimidating appearance and Taiga because of her fiery temper.

However, things take a turn when his classmate, Rikka Takanashi, reminds him of his past and tries to pull him back into the world of Chunibyo with her own delusions. The series delves into their relationship as Yuta unravels the triggers behind Rikka's delusions.The trope of opposites attracting may be overused, but when done well, it can lead to a captivating romantic comedy. ""Kimi ni Todoke"" explores the endearing friendship between the shy Sawako Kuronuma and the popular Shouta Kazehaya. Sawako, often mistaken for Sadako from ""The Ring,"" is isolated at school due to her appearance, making it challenging for her to break out of her shell. Fortunately, Kazehaya is just the right person to help her.""Kimi ni Todoke"" is a delightful and heartwarming anime with well-developed characters who evolve as the story unfolds. While it adheres to typical romance anime pacing, the journey remains engaging and enjoyable.Unlike most romance stories that focus on the process of falling in love, ""Tonikawa: Over The Moon For You"" follows a married couple who have already reached that point. As a result, the anime adopts a slice-of-life approach, showcasing Nasa and Tsukasa's daily life and antics rather than a typical romantic journey. ""Tonikawa"" doesn't rely on dramatic highs but instead offers a pleasant and light-hearted experience.While this anime may not appeal to everyone, it serves as a refreshing departure from more melodramatic romance shows. Despite their tendency to blush at the slightest physical contact, Nasa and Tsukasa are refreshingly direct in expressing their feelings, making them both witty and likeable characters.This romantic anime shines because of its main character, Takeo Gouda. His towering, imposing presence contrasts beautifully with his heartfelt affection for the delicate Rinko, which is truly heartwarming. Takeo's efforts to play matchmaker for Rinko with his best friend, despite his own feelings, demonstrate his genuine kindness.Viewers will undoubtedly root for Takeo and Rinko's endearing relationship. ""My Love Story!!"" delivers the goods without delay, as the main characters are dating for most of the episodes, bypassing the typical slow build-up to a confession.""A Sign of Affection"" is a heartwarming romantic comedy centred on college-age love and the challenges of communication. While not the sole focus of the story, Yuki and Itsuomi stand out as the main couple, instantly captivating viewers. Yuki, who is hearing-impaired, communicates using sign language, text, and by reading lips, while Itsuomi is a world traveller passionate about learning languages. Their connection begins on a train and grows stronger with each subsequent encounter.The anime beautifully captures the intense emotions of falling in love, highlighted by a poignant moment in the opening episode. With an older cast, ""A Sign of Affection"" takes on a more mature tone compared to typical romance anime. Throughout the season, Yuki and Itsuomi become increasingly comfortable around each other, resulting in consistently endearing interactions.This romantic anime is ideal for LGBTQ+ viewers seeking representation on screen, but its well-crafted storytelling makes it enjoyable for all audiences. The heartwarming romance blossoms between Mafuyu and Ritsuka as Mafuyu learns to play guitar and sing in Ritsuka's band.Watching Mafuyu's growing confidence alongside the romantic tension creates a compelling series that's hard to resist. The accompanying movie is also outstanding and a must-watch continuation of the series.Nana is one of the most renowned and beloved shoujo anime of all time, a must-watch for fans of romance and beyond. The series follows two women named Nana, seemingly different but navigating curiously similar life situations that lead to separate outcomes.Without giving away how their stories intertwine, Nana's 47 episodes delve into the protagonists' perspectives on love through various relationships. Grounded in reality, the anime explores complex characters who, despite occasional extremes, face accountability for their actions.Your Lie in April, one of the most famous romance anime, revolves around two music prodigies: Kousei Arima and Kaori Miyazono. Kousei, grappling with depression after his mother's death, loses his passion for the piano and withdraws from the performance arts. One day, he hears Kaori playing her violin with such freedom that it reignites his love for music and sparks his admiration for her.The anime delves into themes of grief, life, love, and music. Kousei's journey toward self-healing is profound, marked by heartbreak, but also punctuated by moments of beauty, tenderness, and joy.In this anime, Miyuki and Kaguya engage in a battle of wits to avoid confessing their love first, using their intellect and skills to outmaneuver each other. Both are determined not to be seen as the one who gives in.Their antics running the student council at an elite school with their friends are uproariously funny yet also contain heartwarming moments that will make viewers cheer. Season 3 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War, which aired in Spring 2022, leaned heavily into comedy but also devoted more time to developing Miyuki and Kaguya's relationship and touching on other romances.If the anime follows the manga, the next season of Love is War promises to be predominantly romantic. If successful, this upcoming release could elevate Kaguya-sama to the pinnacle of romance anime.This anime consists of two parts: Clannad and After Story. The latter surpasses the former by a wide margin, but watching Clannad is essential to fully appreciate the impact of After Story. While it features a diverse cast of supporting characters, the heart of the show revolves around Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa, delivering a profound narrative.Unlike typical romance series, Clannad After Story unfolds beyond high school, depicting the growth of Tomoya and Nagisa as individuals and as a couple. The anime tackles real-life challenges without glossing over them, offering a genuine exploration of common struggles.The Dangers in My Heart is truly brilliant. At first glance, it may seem like another typical shounen romance where a popular girl falls for an ordinary loner guy. These stories often offer little beyond wish fulfilment, and The Dangers in My Heart initially appears to fit that mould. Yet, the anime stands out.Ichikawa is an average guy with few friends who daydreams about unusual things. While the anime doesn't delve deeply into these thoughts, it doesn't ignore them either, leaving Ichikawa with a poor first impression. On the other hand, Anna is a cheerful but shy girl who loves food and works as a model. After a chance encounter at the school library, the two start spending time together, developing a friendship that hints at something deeper. Anna encourages Ichikawa to break out of his shell, leading to significant changes in him over the course of two seasons.Although slow-paced initially, The Dangers in My Heart evolves into something special by the end of season 1, maintaining its momentum in the subsequent cour and establishing itself as one of the best romance anime of all time. Anna and Ichikawa are both exceptional characters, but Anna's depth is what elevates the show. She's not just an idealised plot device; she's a fully realised character with insecurities, quirks, and vulnerabilities. Her interest in Ichikawa feels genuine, and vice versa. This is a rare quality in romance anime.Fruits Basket is the definitive romance anime, masterfully blending drama and comedy. Tooru Honda, a lovable protagonist, faces life's challenges until she moves in with the Souma family. The Soumas, particularly Yuki, are school idols hiding a shocking secret that alters perceptions.Love triangles often lack depth, favouring one partner over the other. Fruits Basket defies this norm with its compelling love triangle, where each character is fully developed. Across three seasons, Fruits Basket takes viewers on an unforgettable journey.Also read | 15 best anime series of all time; here's the list","Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light- hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.

During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs. While staying comfortable during hot weather is essential, it doesn't have to come at the cost of soaring electricity bills. By implementing strategic energy-saving practices, you can reduce your summer electricity expenses without sacrificing comfort.Here you can explore several effective ways to save on summer electricity bills, offering practical tips and strategies that can help you minimise energy consumption and lower your utility costs during the warmer months.From optimising your cooling system to adopting energy-efficient habits, these recommendations are designed to make a noticeable impact on your electricity expenses while keeping your home cool and comfortable.Let's delve into these actionable tips that can help you save money and energy throughout the summer season.The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) issues BEE Star Labels as a voluntary method for manufacturers to indicate an appliance's energy efficiency. The label uses stars to indicate the efficiency of a product, with more stars indicating higher efficiency. Simply put, the higher the energy efficiency rating of the appliance, the lower its energy consumption. To effectively reduce your home's energy costs, opt for appliances with a 5-star BEE rating. Not only does this positively impact the environment, but it also helps lower your electricity bills. Explore Crompton's wide range of 5-star rated ceiling fans to learn more about BEE Rating Appliances.If your home still uses CFLs and incandescent bulbs, it's time to replace them with LED bulbs. LED bulbs are not just a trendy choice; they are recognized for their energy efficiency and superior illumination. If you're wondering how to reduce your electricity bill at home, switching to LED bulbs is the solution for you.Upgrading to smart appliances is a highly effective method to decrease electricity consumption at home. These devices allow you to automate tasks and manage energy usage efficiently. Consider installing energy-efficient ceiling fans to further reduce electricity consumption. Smart appliances typically come equipped with remote control capabilities, allowing you to schedule operations and conserve power. Crompton offers remote-controlled fans designed for enhanced energy savings and lower power consumption.These energy-efficient fans are gaining popularity due to their brushless direct current motors (BLDC), which operate on direct current electricity. They can help save up to 60% on electricity compared to normal induction motor-based fans. Additionally, they offer convenient features like remote control for turning the fan on and off, timer functionality, and compatibility with voice assistants. To learn more about the differences between BLDC fans and normal fans and how they can help reduce electricity bills, explore further information on BLDC fans versus conventional fans.Implementing a full solar power system for your home can be a substantial investment. However, there are more accessible and cost-effective ways to leverage solar energy. Installing outdoor solar lights in your balcony and garden, along with solar fans, can notably reduce your energy expenses at a modest cost. Additionally, using solar pumps for daily tasks can contribute to electricity savings. It's beneficial to understand the distinction between an electric geyser and a solar geyser to make an informed choice for your energy needs.Maintain your air conditioner at 24 degrees Celsius to optimise cooling and conserve energy during the summer months, effectively lowering electricity costs. Additionally, using a timer to automate AC operation and upgrading to a 5-star BEE-rated model can further enhance energy efficiency and reduce expenses associated with cooling your space.Numerous advanced smart energy metres are currently offered in the market. These metres typically use Wi-Fi connectivity to monitor overall power usage within a home and provide real-time analysis of consumption patterns. Additionally, they can detect power leaks and identify high-energy-consuming appliances. Wi-Fi LED bulbs represent an excellent choice for reducing electricity usage.Regularly servicing and maintaining your home appliances is essential for optimal functionality and efficiency. Appliances that are not properly maintained are known to consume excessive energy, so routine maintenance can prolong their lifespan and reduce energy consumption. Learn more about the importance of cleaning exhaust fans.Install a power strip if you have several electronic devices or appliances that need to be plugged into a single electrical outlet. This allows you to easily turn off all devices at once when they are not in use, preventing unnecessary energy consumption often referred to as ""phantom"" energy loss.One of the simplest and most effective methods to lower electricity costs is by turning off electrical devices such as lights, fans, and air conditioners when they are not in use.","During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs.
