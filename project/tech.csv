How Bane Elevates the Lakers’ Title Chances

After a disappointing first-round playoff exit against the Minnesota Timberwolves, theface tough decisions this offseason. The front office may explore trades to strengthen the roster aroundand LeBron James . One potential move? A blockbuster swap sending Reaves to Memphis for sharpshooting guard Desmond Bane .The Los Angeles Lakers ’ backcourt needs an upgrade, especially in scoring efficiency and defense.While Reaves is a solid playmaker, his role diminishes alongside two elite facilitators like Doncic and James.Key reasons to trade Reaves (according NBA analyst Dean Simon):- Redundant Playmaking: With Doncic and James handling most playmaking duties, Reaves’ skills aren’t fully utilized.- Defensive Limitations: Reaves struggles against elite guards, while Bane has shown defensive growth.- Need for Reliable Shooting: Desmond Bane’s elite three-point shooting (39.2% career) fits better alongside two ball-dominant stars.As Dean Simon of the Sporting News notes in the original article: ""Instead of trotting out another floor general that takes pick-and-roll possessions out of Doncic and James' hands, you replace that with a reactionary scorer that can knock down catch-and-shoot threes.""Desmond Bane, who signed a $197 million extension with Memphis, has developed into one of the league’s most efficient scorers. His 2024-25 stats showcase his all-around growth:Beyond scoring, Desmond Bane’s improved playmaking (5.3 assists per game) and defense (113 defensive rating) make him an ideal third option. His ability to play off-ball and stretch the floor would give Doncic and James more spacing.For this deal to work, the Los Angeles Lakers would likely need to include additional assets:- Desmond Bane- Austin Reaves- Rui Hachimura- Shake MiltonThis trade gives Memphis a younger core piece in Reaves, while the Lakers get a proven scorer who fits their timeline.Adding Bane would address multiple weaknesses (according to Dean Simon):- Elite Three-Point Shooting: Provides much-needed spacing for Doncic and James.- Secondary Playmaking: Can initiate offense when needed.- Defensive Upgrade: His size (6’5”) and improved steals (1.2 per game) help against elite guards.With Bane, the Lakers could realistically compete in a stacked Western Conference. His ability to score efficiently without dominating the ball makes him an ideal fit alongside two superstars.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could re-sign $18,001,011 Charlotte Hornets center, fixing Luka Doncic's biggest weakness after playoff disaster If the Los Angeles Lakers want to maximize their championship window, trading Reaves for Bane is a move worth exploring. Memphis gets a promising young guard, while Los Angeles adds a polished scorer who complements their stars perfectly. As the offseason unfolds, this could be the deal that reshapes the Lakers’ future.","The Los Angeles Lakers face tough decisions this offseason.

Julian Edelman’s Patriots Hall of Fame induction brings back emotional memories for Tom Brady

Tom Brady leans on friendships as he navigates post-retirement life and personal change

After a turbulent year marked by his retirement from the NFL and a very public breakup with supermodel Gisele Bündchen , Tom Brady is finding new reasons to smile—and this time, it’s not about football glory or career milestones. The legendary quarterback recently expressed heartfelt joy over the induction of his longtime friend and former teammate Julian Edelman into the New England Patriots Hall of Fame.Tom Brady and Julian Edelman share a bond that extends far beyond the gridiron. The two created one of the most iconic QB-WR duos in NFL history, helping the Patriots clinch three Super Bowl titles and countless unforgettable moments. Now, with Edelman being honored for his contribution to the franchise, Brady was quick to show his support with a brief yet meaningful message on social media: “You deserve it.”That simple tribute carried the weight of years of brotherhood, perseverance, and mutual respect. For Brady, the recognition of Edelman’s career also seems to represent something deeper—a welcome reminder of loyalty and friendship during a time of personal transformation.Tom Brady’s split from Gisele Bündchen after 13 years of marriage understandably shifted much of the media’s focus from his career achievements to his private life. As she has moved on publicly, Brady has been quietly adjusting to life after football and life without one of the most high-profile marriages in sports history.In moments like this—celebrating Edelman’s well-earned accolade—Brady appears to be drawing strength and joy from the unshakable bonds built during his playing days. These relationships, rooted in years of shared sacrifice and trust, seem to provide emotional grounding amid the transitions of retirement and personal reinvention.Brady has always been known for his intensity, discipline, and desire to win. But in this chapter of his life, it’s clear he also values legacy, connection, and loyalty just as much. Honoring Edelman isn’t just a nod to the past—it’s a sign that Brady is looking forward while cherishing the people who helped define his journey.Also Read: “Stop calling me someone’s ex”: Kayla Nicole moves beyond Travis Kelce’s shadow and the Taylor Swift narrative In a time when headlines often blur the personal and professional, Brady’s sincere appreciation for Edelman shows where his heart truly lies: with those who stood beside him through it all.Gisele Bündchen and Joaquim Valente are enjoying their new life after welcoming their baby.

Example: ""dear"" and ""deer"" tend to be linked by sound, not by some elaborate relationship such as predator and prey.

You have only four guesses per puzzle per day, so every guess matters.

Don't mindlessly click—consider each set carefully before submitting.

Try to come up with at least three connected words confidently before trying a set.

The initial organization is deliberately mischievous to mislead you.

Nintendo began distributing pre-order invitations today for its highly anticipated Switch 2 console, offering select customers a chance to secure the device ahead of its June 5 launch. The My Nintendo Store is prioritizing invites to accounts with 12-month Nintendo Online subscriptions and at least 50 hours of playtime on the original Switch. Invitations will continue to be sent through May 12 while supplies last, with recipients given 72 hours to finalize their purchase.Pre-order access also includes exclusive accessories like the limited Nintendo Switch 2 GameCube controller , which will become available to all Nintendo Online subscribers starting May 13, if stock remains.The Demand will significantly outpace supply, with Nintendo expecting to sell 15 million units in the fiscal year ending March 2026. Earlier pre-order opportunities at major retailers like GameStop, Walmart, and Best Buy sold out within minutes when they launched on April 24.Adding to consumer urgency, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa recently warned that the console's $449 price tag could increase due to President Trump's tariff policies. ""Our basic policy is to recognize tariffs as a cost when determining sales prices in any country or region and to incorporate them into the price,"" Furukawa stated during an earnings call.The Switch 2 will retail for $449 for the standalone console or $499 bundled with Mario Kart World. Technical specifications include 1080p resolution in handheld mode and 4K when docked, with 256GB internal storage expandable via microSD Express cards.For those who missed retailer pre-orders, checking the My Nintendo Store regularly through May 12 is recommended, as some eligible customers may receive invitations without email notifications.","Nintendo began distributing pre-order invitations for its highly anticipated Switch 2 console today.

This initiative seeks to create a secure, decentralized system distinguishing humans from AI. The Orb scans irises, generating encrypted IrisCodes stored on a blockchain. In exchange for participation, users receive 14 WLD cryptocurrency tokens.

World ID and Match Group partner to combat online dating fraud

Addressing privacy concerns and ethical challenges

The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and digital technologies has brought both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges, particularly in verifying online identities. In response to this, Sam Altman , the visionary co-founder of OpenAI, has introduced his latest ambitious endeavor, the World Project , in the United States. Previously known as Worldcoin, this initiative aims to revolutionize digital identity verification using biometric data, specifically through eye-scanning technology .The project, co-developed by Tools for Humanity, seeks to create a global, secure, and decentralized identity system that can differentiate humans from AI bots in an increasingly digital world. As the World Project officially launched in six US cities on May 1, 2025, it marked a significant step toward transforming online authentication and digital trust.The World Project is driven by a bold vision: to establish a universally accessible digital identity system that safeguards individual privacy while ensuring secure interactions online. The core technology behind this initiative is the Orb, a sleek, silver sphere designed to scan and encode a user’s unique iris pattern into an encrypted IrisCode. Unlike traditional username and password systems, which are vulnerable to hacking and phishing, the World ID offers a more secure alternative by using biometric data that cannot be easily replicated.Tools for Humanity, the company behind the World Project, was co-founded by Sam Altman and CEO Alex Blania. Their mission is to build a decentralized identity platform that can serve as a foundational layer for the digital economy, reducing fraud and restoring trust in online interactions. The World ID system promises to be a critical tool in combating the rise of deepfakes, AI-generated content, and bot-driven misinformation.The Orb is a key component of the World Project’s identity verification system. It captures a user’s iris pattern, transforming it into a unique IrisCode that is encrypted and stored on a blockchain. This approach offers significant security advantages:In the US, the initial rollout includes 7,500 Orbs deployed across six major cities: Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, and San Francisco. The company plans to quadruple its global hardware footprint by the end of 2025, further expanding the availability of World IDs.To encourage early adoption, the World Project offers users 14 WLD cryptocurrency tokens in exchange for participating in the iris-scanning process. These tokens, part of the broader World ecosystem, can be used for online transactions, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and digital identity verification.In addition to the Orb, the World Project is set to launch the World Card, a crypto-linked debit card developed in partnership with Visa. This card will allow users to spend their WLD tokens at any location that accepts Visa, bridging the gap between the digital and physical economies. This integration marks a significant step toward making digital currencies more practical and widely accepted.The US launch of the World Project comes with several high-profile partnerships aimed at integrating World ID into mainstream applications. Notably, Match Group, the parent company of Tinder, Hinge, and other dating platforms, is piloting World ID for identity verification on Tinder in Japan. This move is intended to reduce catfishing and online fraud by ensuring that users are verified humans. If successful, this technology could extend to other dating platforms, enhancing user trust and safety.Despite its ambitious goals, the World Project faces significant challenges, particularly around privacy and data security. Critics have raised concerns about the ethical implications of incentivizing biometric data collection with cryptocurrency rewards. Reports of coercion by Orb operators in some regions and the emergence of a black market for iris data have further complicated the project’s public perception.To address these concerns, the World Project has emphasized its commitment to transparency and data protection. The company claims that it does not store actual iris images and that its blockchain-based approach ensures that no single entity can control or misuse the data. Nevertheless, building public trust will be a critical factor in the project’s long-term success.","OpenAI's Sam Altman launched the World Project in the US on May 1, 2025.

"Titanic survivor’s haunting letter written days before sinking sells for record £300,000 at auction; here’s what it said",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/titanic-survivors-haunting-letter-sells-for-record-300000-at-auction/articleshow/120680669.cms,"



A rare letter penned by Colonel Archibald Gracie , one of the Titanic’s most distinguished survivors, has fetched a record £300,000, a fivefold increase on its estimated price, at an auction in Wiltshire, as a new high price for Titanic correspondence was smashed.The letter, dated April 10, 1912, the very day Gracie boarded the Titanic, offers a chilling glimpse into the final days before disaster struck. Written on a Titanic letter card and postmarked in Queenstown and London, it is ominous in tone, with the following ominous words: ""It is a fine ship but I shall await my journey's end before I pass judgment on her.""Auctioneer Henry Aldridge and Son described it as ""a truly exceptional, museum-grade piece,"" saying it is the record price for a Titanic letter. Survivor letters of Gracie's stature are extremely rare, with this one never previously on the market.he four-page letter, written to a family acquaintance who befriended Gracie at the London Waldorf Hotel, is warm in its reminiscence about his earlier crossings on the Oceanic, remembering, ""Her sea-worthy qualities and yacht-like appearance make me miss her,"" while also marveling at the size of the Titanic.Days later, Gracie would be a participant in one of history's most horrific nights. Following an evening of squash, a dip in the ship's pool, and a Sunday church service, Gracie was rudely awakened at 11:40 pm by the abrupt shutdown of Titanic's engines. Without hesitation, he assisted women and children into lifeboats, procuring blankets to protect them from the cold.When the ship finally went down into the Atlantic waves, Gracie crawled onto an upturned collapsible boat with other survivors. In the blackness, frantic swimmers cried out for assistance, but fear of capsizing prevented those on board from taking on more. Gracie remembered with sorrow that over half the men holding on to the upturned boat died before dawn, exhausted and chilled.""In no instance, I am happy to say, did I hear any word of rebuke,"" Gracie wrote in his later memoir, The Truth About the Titanic, recounting the final moments of those left behind, some offering blessings rather than curses.Col. Gracie's eye-witness account is still one of the most detailed and graphic accounts of the tragedy.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for GTA 6, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

Rashee Rice’s TikTok moment at the salon has the internet in full-blown investigator mode



“Yes ma’am.”

Fans aren’t sure if that’s a “barber” or his new boo and the jokes are flying



“That’s sure is his barber alright,”

“barber”

“She’s pretty,”

“Dawg just wanted a bad bih to do his hair.”

“I need a barber.”

Some fans used the moment to roast Rice’s past and throw shade



“I’m so proud of him for not breaking the law this offseason,”

“Hopefully he didn’t drive there.”

You’d think Rashee Rice was just minding his business during the offseason, getting his dreads done like any other NFL star. But the internet never sleeps, especially when you’re on TikTok, looking polite, and your “barber” is fine. The Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver went viral this week after a video surfaced of him softly responding, “Yes ma’am,” to the woman doing his hair and now the streets (aka NFL Twitter) have questions, jokes, and side-eyes ready.The video that kicked this all off shows Rice sitting quietly while a woman, presumably his hairstylist, works on his dreads.When she asks something off-camera, he calmly replies,It was quick. It was polite. But it was enough.Within hours, the clip exploded on TikTok, Twitter (X). Why? Because fans weren’t just listening to what Rice said, they were clocking everything else. The vibe. The voice. The fact that the “barber” might not be a barber at all. Add in Rice’s past offseason troubles, and the internet was instantly locked in.Let’s be honest, the woman doing his hair is stunning. And naturally, fans immediately questioned the professional label.one user quipped, while another simply addedin quotes, no explanation needed. Someone else chimed in withwhile another added,The consensus? Rice may have gone in for a retwist, but this looked a lot like soft flirting with a side of edge control.And of course, there's always that one user who summed it up best:Rashee hasn’t exactly had the cleanest offseason. Following a car crash and legal issues earlier this year, he's been under heavy scrutiny. So naturally, some fans used the moment to fire shots.one person posted, dripping in sarcasm. Another tweeted,Ouch.Lost in the noise of jokes and trolling, though, is a weirdly wholesome truth: Rashee Rice being soft-spoken and respectful during a salon visit, kind of won people over. It’s not every day you hear a rising NFL star be so polite in a viral clip. Some fans appreciated the Southern manners, others loved the energy, and a few probably replayed “Yes ma’am” on a loop for personal reasons.Also read - Skip Bayless fires back in lengthy 25-minute rant, calls Tom Brady out on his bullsh*t denial of Shedeur Sanders’ draft impact","Rashee Rice's TikTok moment at the salon has the internet in full-blown investigator mode.

""Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2 was captured entirely in-game from a PlayStation 5, comprised of equal parts gameplay and cutscenes.""

Visual fidelity muddies the distinction between gameplay and cutscenes



Rockstar Games ' second trailer of Grand Theft Auto VI has created renewed excitement surrounding the delayed game, flaunting breathtaking visuals and a melodramatic atmosphere leading up to its 2026 release. According to the studio, the trailer was filmed fully in-game using a PlayStation 5 and features an even ratio of gameplay to cutscenes. But players remain confused, as most of them can't catch the gameplay.Rockstar released the eagerly awaited second GTA VI trailer on May 6, 2025, which brings protagonists Jason and Lucia forward and gives us more looks at Vice City and its environs in the Leonida state.The release was accompanied by Rockstar's social media posting:The release immediately sparked debate online, as many fans asked what constitutesin the clip. Aesthetically, the trailer is a showstopper, filled with detail, movement, and sheen, but its movie-like presentation obscures which shots are truly manipulated by a player.Others identify possible gameplay transitions through subtle cues, such as Jason walking into his home. These moments are brief and lack the typical hallmarks of gameplay, like HUD elements, dynamic camera shifts, or visible player input.The suspense probably originates from Rockstar's seamless treatment of in-engine presentation. Much like what they've done for Red Dead Redemption 2, the visual division between gameplay and cutscenes is hardly discernible. That in itself is a technical achievement, but it puts the fans wanting greater openness, especially after they have waited over one year from one trailer to another.Rockstar's purpose possibly was to display the ease with which the game moves from controlled sequences to in-game scenes, but without full disclosures, fans are left in the dark as to how GTA VI really plays.The game, due for release in 2026 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, now has fans anticipating a special gameplay rundown or demo that will finally silence theories.Also Read: Everything we know about GTA 6 so far","GTA 6 trailer 2 reportedly includes gameplay, yet viewers question what they're seeing.

Rockstar Games has always pushed the boundaries of open-world crime simulations, andlooks to take it even further. One of the most intriguing details hidden in Trailer 2 is the possibility that players will have multiple ways to rob stores—whether by slapping a cashier, beating them with a bat, or using intimidation. This isn’t just speculation; the trailer shows Jason assaulting a shopkeeper in two different ways, suggesting thatmay introduce dynamic robbery mechanics where players can choose their approach.Here’s the proof—and what it could mean for gameplay.In one shot from the trailer, Jason is seen in a store collecting money from the cashier. In that scene, he is holding a baseball bat in his hand. However, he doesn’t use the baseball bat on the cashier, and instead, he slaps him. This could mean that players may get multiple intimidation options while robbing stores in GTA 6:This small but crucial detail suggests that robberies won’t be one-note actions—instead, they could have different risk/reward outcomes based on how aggressive you are.If Rockstar expands on this idea, we could see a fully dynamic robbery system where:This would align with’s emphasis on realistic NPC behavior, as seen in the trailer where some bystanders ignore Jason’s assault entirely—possibly because they’re scared or used to crime.Fans ofwill remember that Arthur Morgan could rob stores in different ways:Ifadopts a similar system, it would make robberies more immersive and replayable—no more mindless button-mashing like inThe fact that Rockstar hid this mechanic in plain sight suggests thatwill reward player creativity—whether you’re a ruthless thief or a calculated criminal. Will slapping a cashier give you less money but keep cops away? Will brutal robberies make store owners recognize and fear you later? We’ll have to wait and see, but one thing’s clear: GTA 6 is making crime personal, and how you choose to rob stores might define your entire playthrough.","In GTA 6 trailer 2, Jason is seen slapping the cashier even though he has a baseball bat.

One of the most intriguing details in GTA 6’s second trailer wasn’t a crime, a character, or a hidden map clue—it was a PlayStation 5 sitting in Jason’s safehouse. At first glance, it seems like a simple background prop, but in the world of Rockstar Games, nothing is accidental. Could this be a subtle hint at a Sony partnership? Or is it just an Easter egg teasing the game’s next-gen exclusivity? Let’s break down the possibilities.Rockstar has a history of real-world brand references in its games, but a fully modeled PS5 is different from a parody soda can.The console is clearly visible in the safehouse scene, suggesting it wasn’t just thrown in randomly.Sony has a history of securing timed exclusives with Rockstar.If Sony secured even a timed exclusive perk for, it would be a massive win—especially since the game is already confirmed for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S (no PC at launch).On the other hand, Rockstar loves satirizing real-life brands. Past GTAs featured fake consoles like the ""Emotion"" (a mock PlayStation) and the ""iFruit"" (a parody of Apple).If this is just a parody, the ""PS5"" might be renamed something like ""Play & Slay"" or ""Station V"" in the final game. But the fact that it looks identical to a real PS5 suggests Rockstar might have a deal in place to use the official design.If Sony is collaborating with Rockstar, we could see:Microsoft, on the other hand, might counter with Game Pass perks—meaning the console wars could spill intoitself.While it’s possible the PS5 is just set dressing, Rockstar rarely does anything without reason. Given Sony’s past deals and the insane hype around, this could be a subtle tease of an upcoming partnership. Will PlayStation players get exclusive content? Will the console appear in a mission or heist? Or is this just another brilliant fake-out from Rockstar? One thing’s for sure—that PS5 isn’t there by accident.",A PS5 was spotted by fans in the GTA 6 trailer 2. Could this be a subtle hint at a Sony partnership?

But Hold On… Could It Just Be Scripted?

is

Rockstar Games dropped the second GTA 6 trailer on May 6, 2025, and fans are already in deep theory mode. One scene, in particular, has lit up the internet: Lucia scaling down the side of a building like she’s straight out of Assassin’s Creed. Could GTA be bringing back parkour-style movement we last saw in GTA 4? Or is this just cinematic flair? Let’s break it down.In the trailer, we see Lucia climbing down a building’s exterior, with Jason helping her from above.The drop looks at least three stories high, and the way she moves suggests controlled free-climbing rather than a scripted animation.Back in GTA 4, Niko Bellic could:It was basic, but it worked. GTA 5, however, took a step back—movement felt heavier and more rigid, especially during chases..Lucia’s actions throughout the trailer scream agility—climbing, kicking enemies, jumping into moving vehicles. Could her prison background explain a higher base level of athleticism?In an earlier scene, Jason is seen fixing a roof. Coincidence? Or could GTA 6 feature a skill progression system tied to climbing, construction, or urban navigation?Lucia drops from a serious height with no injury. Could Rockstar be adjusting fall damage to allow more vertical freedom without punishing players for taking risks?Not everyone’s convinced. Some fans believe this could be a one-off story moment, not tied to regular gameplay. That’s fair—Rockstar is known for mixing cinematic flair with gameplay teases. Still, given the studio’s increasing focus on realism and immersion, it wouldn’t be surprising if enhanced movement is a core feature this time.If this isn't just a one-time sequence, GTA 6 might be bringing back parkour—and making it better. That would open up insane new possibilities: more intense police chases, creative heist routes, and deeper exploration.Of course, this is all speculation for now—take it with a grain of salt. But if Rockstarhinting at revamped movement mechanics, we might be heading into the most dynamic GTA world yet.","Rockstar Games dropped the second GTA 6 trailer on May 6, 2025.

How to build Tak & Lug in Warframe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/news/how-to-build-tak-lug-in-warframe/articleshow/121063209.cms,"Image via: Digital Extremes

First Impressions: Blast Without the Boom

Tak & Lug: A Unique Explosive Addition to Warframe’s Melee Arsenal

Stats Snapshot: Decent But Not Dominating

Attack Speed - 1.0



- 1.0 Base Range- 2.5m



NEW Warframe Weapon 'TAK & LUK', Testing Builds - New Players welcome!

How to Build Tak & Lug



Status Build Focus

Condition Overload - For scaling melee damage upon status effects



- For scaling melee damage upon status effects Weeping Wounds - Increase status on combo multiplier



- Increase status on combo multiplier Virulent Scourge + Vicious Frost (or whatever dual-stat mods): More increased status and elemental damage.



Slash Maximation

Buzz Kill - Increase Slash Damage by direct means



- Increase Slash Damage by direct means Primed Pressure Point- For raw melee damage scaling



Utility Options

Range mods - Hits aren't far apart, not a natural AOE weapon, but more range can make up for its narrow hitbox



- Hits aren't far apart, not a natural AOE weapon, but more range can make up for its narrow hitbox Life Strike- For survivability, more so if you're running high sustain builds.



Who Should Use It?

TAK & LUG: NOVA ARMA NUKE DO WARFRAME (COM UM MOD IMPORTANTE!) | BUILD ENDGAME & ANÁLISE (2025)

Those who have been playing Warframe know that this game is subject to practically weekly changes. Recently, the Tak & Lug saw its introduction via the Galleon of Ghouls event . I would say its looks are rather modest, especially when compared to more ornate variants such as their Prime or Tenet brethren.And yet, this Grineer-forged weapon has its own special charm, mainly in its attempts to rename heavy attacks .Read on for a brief description of the reasons why Tak & Lug should be given a try and how to make the best out of it.According to the description of Tak & Lug in-game, the weapon should have a heavy attack that affects a wide area with some Blast — one that conjures images of explosive shockwaves that go about clearing rooms. Things, however, do not happen that way in actual gameplay.The unique special in this case behaves much like a thrown projectile. On performing a heavy attack, the Warframe throws the shield forward in a straight line with its incredible throwing ability. This travel distance is around 9 meters and hits any enemies directly in its path.Rather than being an AOE blast, somehow, the attack has become a targeted projectile skillshot with body punch-through that casually clips an enemy or two behind the primary target but hardly any more than that.Importantly, this is not chainable. There is no heavy follow-up or slam; you get one throw once, with no stance interaction.The stats of Tak & Lug, when viewed on paper, are not really something to admire:This implies a status weapon with a bias toward Slash procs, meaning it is good for bypassing armor and damaging over time. Thus, high crit stats and average range have no place here, leaving them to be compensated via mod choices and synergizing.For maximum value from Tak & Lug, best to just forget about the gimmick and focus entirely on reliability. Proposed progression:For a collector, this weapon has a limited-time offer for being event exclusive. In gameplay, it perfectly fits mid-tier content or status-hybrid builds, more specifically for Warframes who thrive on clicking something quickly to spread multiple effects (Saryn, Khora, and others). In any case, this is not the way to go if you want the best of the best in melee damage.Tak & Lug might disappoint in its ""wide area"" promise, but its specialized shield throw offers an interesting tactical dimension—even for those who prefer precision and utility to brute force. It's just that, on the right build, maybe throw in a few flashy moves and this will be a stylish addition to an arsenal, but it won't do anything really spectacular, breaking the meta, as some had hoped.","The Tak & Lug is a new melee weapon for the Warframe game. It has been introduced via the Galleon of Ghouls event. The weapon has a range of 2.5m and a speed of 1.0m. It is not an AOE weapon, but more range makes up for its narrow hitbox.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121063433,imgsize-80110,width-400,resizemode-4/Warframe-.jpg"

:

This article is just speculation based on rumours and analysis. Everything in this article should be taken with a grain of salt!

The Grand Theft Auto series has always let players live out criminal fantasies, but what if GTA 6 flips the script? A shocking detail in Trailer 2 hints that, for the first time, we might play as a cop—or even control a third, mystery character outside of Jason and Lucia. Here's what fans (and we) think.In Trailer 2, a serious-looking cop appears in several different scenes—none of which feature either of the confirmed protagonists, Lucia or Jason.That alone has fans raising eyebrows. Rockstargives screen time to non-playable characters in cutscenes unless they’re crucial to the plot. And certainly not multiple times. The camera shakes like bodycam footage, and we hear an officer say:This line sounds like internal police drama—possibly hinting at corruption or a deeper storyline. In pastgames, cops were either enemies or background NPCs. This suggests active involvement.So who is this mystery officer? Why is he shown repeatedly, busting doors and chasing chaos solo? Rockstar knows how to tell a story with subtle clues, and this cop’s prominence isn’t accidental.Rewind to Trailer 1. There’s a blink-and-you-miss-it shot from what looks like a police body cam, shown from a first-person angle. At the time, people speculated this might hint that Jason is an undercover cop or ex-officer. But now that Trailer 2 gives us more of Jason’s backstory, that theory feels off.So... what if it wasn’t Jason at all? What if that first-person shot was fromunnamed officer? If true, Rockstar may be teasing an entirely new gameplay perspective—one where you enforce the law, not just break it.There’s still no official confirmation of a third playable character. Rockstar could be using the cop as a narrative anchor, a recurring antagonist, or even a way to show the chaos from the other side. It's also possible the scenes are mission-specific, and not linked to a playable role at all.There’s just enough to make the cop-playable theory, and just enough doubt to keep us on edge. Whether he’s a surprise protagonist or a constant thorn in Jason and Lucia’s side, one thing’s clear: Rockstar wants us to notice him. And in the world of GTA, attention equals importance.","Fans believe that this cop from trailer 2 could be the third playable character in GTA 6.
