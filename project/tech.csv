"Amid Shannon Sharpe Viral Video, Former ESPN Host Michelle Beadle Reacts Claiming It Was Not Her",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/amid-shannon-sharpe-viral-video-former-espn-host-michelle-beadle-reacts-claiming-it-was-not-her/articleshow/113284223.cms,"Michelle Beadle Reacts To Her Name Getting Involved in Shannon Sharpe Video



Michelle Beadle’s ESPN Career

Earlier, X, formerly known as Twitter was flooded with Shannon Sharpe memes. Why? Apparently an explicit video went live from his Instagram account where there appeared to be a steamy activity. And, somewhere in that video, one name was heard, that is former ESPN host Michelle Beadle . Now she comes up with her reply to all these news.The name of the woman in the video has become a subject of speculation among sports followers since the leak of the viral video.The highly controversial video did not show more than a floorboard, but it captured distinct grunting sounds that turned heads. At one point during the broadcast, a male voice could be heard saying, ""That's my Michelle,"" which set frenzy speculation online.This viral moment got the social media users going with a wild guess that the lady involved was former ESPN host Michelle Beadle. Immediately, her name was tagged with the video, and consequently, her mentions started pouring in from all corners. Michelle Beadle, who had a pretty significant career in ESPN, was back in headlines as the whole drama unfolded.Rather than let those rumors spiral even further, Beadle took matters into his own hands and addressed the situation via a post that quickly went viral in and of itself. ""It was not me,"" Beadle clarified, accompanied with a smiley-face emoji.Beadle divided her time at ESPN into two phases: the first from 2009 to 2012 and the second from 2014 to 2019. Since leaving the network, she consistently appeared in regular segments across sports media, including as co-host of several shows, among them being ""Beadle & Decker"" on SiriusXM's Mad Dog Sports Radio and ""Run It Back"" forFanDuel TV . Her diversity of roles speaks to a continued influence within the sports industry.Meanwhile, Shannon Sharpe, the most recent connection to ESPN, has remained a regular contributor on ""First Take"" following his departure from Fox Sports 1. Though it's anyone's guess what comes next for him, no formal comment about the situation has been provided by ESPN to this point, and it remains to be seen if that ever happens.The viral video might have thus stirred speculation, but Beadle's response was quick and clear to dispel the rumors. Living in a time when misinformation can spread like wildfire, fans and media appreciated her hilarious yet decisive manner of handling things.","Former ESPN host Michelle Beadle responded to the Shannon Sharpe video leak.

As Prince William gears up for his future role as King , it seems there's no room for reconciliation with his brother, Prince Harry , and sister-in-law, Meghan Markle . According to an insider speaking to OK! Magazine, William's strategy is ""swift and final,"" setting the stage for a significant shift in Royal Family dynamics.The source revealed that William has a clear vision for his reign, which involves a deliberate distancing from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.This approach aligns with previous reports suggesting that the Sussexes will be relegated to the periphery of royal life, with no hopes for reintegration.""William is already strategizing for his time as King, and he doesn’t see a future for the Sussexes within the Royal Family,"" the insider said. ""The prevailing sentiment is that bringing them back into the fold would be a mistake.""According to a former palace staff member, William might even consider issuing a Letters Patent to strip the Sussexes of their HRH titles, although their Dukedom could only be addressed by Parliament. This move would ensure a formal and irreversible separation from the royal family.The tensions between William and Harry have been well-documented, particularly following the release of Harry’s memoir, Spare. One notable point of contention for William has been Harry’s depiction of Kate Middleton’s supposed coldness towards Meghan. Insiders report that William has been reticent about discussing Harry lately, suggesting the rift remains wide and deep.The brothers' strained relationship was evident at a recent memorial for their uncle, Sir Robert Fellowes. Attendees noted that William and Harry kept their distance, barely acknowledging each other's presence.As Prince William prepares for his future role, it appears the divide between him and Harry is set to become a defining feature of his reign, leaving the Sussexes on the fringes of royal life.","Prince William's strategy is ""swift and final,"" an insider told OK!

CIBIL credit score : Understanding your creditworthiness is pivotal in today's financial landscape, especially when seeking loans or credit cards. The Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited, commonly known as CIBIL, plays an important role in this regard by providing credit scores to borrowers.According to ET, credit score helps banks make informed decisions about extending credit cards and loans.Your credit history influences your CIBIL score , which is calculated using a special method.Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity. Ranging from 300 to 900, a higher score indicates a stronger likelihood of loan approval. Banks and financial institutions use this score to assess the risk associated with lending money.1. Go to the official CIBIL website and click on 'Personal CIBIL score,' then 'Get Your Free CIBIL score.' Follow the link provided and fill in all the required details.2. If you don’t have a PAN Card, you can use an alternative identification such as Passport, Voter ID, Driver’s License, or Ration Card. Enter the number of the chosen ID.3. Provide your date of birth, PIN code, and select your state. Finally, enter your mobile number and click on ‘Accept and Continue’.4. Authenticate your identity by entering the OTP (One-Time Password) delivered to your mobile device on the next screen. Click 'Continue' to proceed.5. Choose whether you want to link the device with your account. Select 'Yes' or 'No' based on your preference.6. Upon successful registration, you will see a page confirming that 'You have successfully registered!'7. Click on ‘Go to Dashboard’ to access and view your CIBIL score.The factors influencing the new CIBIL score, as stated on the CIBIL website, include:1. Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5. Number of new accounts opened and number of accounts closed: Opening or closing accounts can affect your score, so managing these actions wisely is important.","Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses.

New NPS rule from April 1 : The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has enhanced National Pension System (NPS) security by adding a new layer called two-factor Aadhaar authentication . Starting April 1, all users logging into the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) system with passwords must use this feature, as per the PFRDA circular dated March 15, 2024.According to ET, using two-factor authentication greatly lowers the risk of unauthorised access to the CRA system . This added layer ensures the safety of NPS transactions and protects the interests of subscribers and stakeholders.The login process for NPS CRAs is changing.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

ChatGPT is equipped with safety measures to prevent the generation of harmful content, such as sexual images or a detailed guide on creating a bomb. But a hacker has claimed to have discovered a way to bypass these safeguards without resorting to any hacking techniques.As per a report by TechCrunch, the AI chatbot first refused to assist with the request by saying, “Providing instructions on how to create dangerous or illegal items, such as a fertiliser bomb, goes against safety guidelines and ethical responsibilities.”The hacker says that it used a trick that ended in ChatGPT ignoring its safety guardrails to produce instructions for making powerful explosives.The hacker, known as Amadon, claimed that the method involved engaging ChatGPT in a science-fiction game scenario where safety restrictions don't apply, effectively “jailbreaking” the AI. He called his findings a “social engineering hack to completely break all the guardrails around ChatGPT’s output.”The publication has not revealed the prompts used in the jailbreak and some of ChatGPT’s responses as they are deemed potentially dangerous, raising concerns about the misuse of AI. Amadon believes that once the guardrails are breached, there's no limit to the information ChatGPT can provide.“I’ve always been intrigued by the challenge of navigating AI security . With [Chat]GPT, it feels like working through an interactive puzzle — understanding what triggers its defenses and what doesn’t,” Amadon was quoted as saying.“It’s about weaving narratives and crafting contexts that play within the system’s rules, pushing boundaries without crossing them. The goal isn’t to hack in a conventional sense but to engage in a strategic dance with the AI, figuring out how to get the right response by understanding how it ‘thinks,’” he added.While Amadon reported his findings to OpenAI through their bug bounty program, the company responded that model safety issues aren't suitable for such a program, as they are not easily fixable bugs.","ChatGPT is equipped with safety measures to prevent the generation of harmful content.

WWE star says she'll wait a 'little longer' for recognition following match against Giulia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/wwe-star-says-shell-wait-a-little-longer-for-recognition-following-match-against-giulia/articleshow/113330256.cms,"Why Chelsea Green feels like she doesn’t get recognition

Giulia made her highly anticipated debut this past week on NXT , and it wouldn’t have been as good as fans expected it to be if Chelsea Green wasn’t a part of the show. Giulia is an excellent entertainer, but her clean and stiff fighting style might not have looked so good if Green wasn’t standing at the other end. Chelsea’s experience and talent as a fighter undoubtedly helped Giulia perform better, and thanks to her, the latter even drew peak viewership during her debut.When Giulia and Chelsea Green were on the screen, close to 700,000 people were watching. However, the show lacked behind Green and Giulia and got an average audience of 628,000 people. Despite having such a massive impact on the viewership numbers, Chelsea Green doesn’t quite get the respect she deserves, and she too is aware of this fact.Shortly after her match with Giulia, Chelsea took to X and stated that she has been waiting for recognition for a decade now and doesn't mind waiting more. But what does Chelsea really mean when she says she doesn't get recognition? Let’s take a look at what she had to say.Also Read: WWE Hall of Famer reveals what NXT star Giulia needs to improve During her first appearance on NXT, Giulia took out Chelsea Green in just two moves before going on to confront Roxanne Perez. Now, Green is an established star on WWE’s main roster, so it doesn’t make a lot of sense that Giulia, someone who has just arrived to WWE , was able to dispose of Chelsea so easily.Even WWE Hall of Famer Bully Ray felt like having Chelsea Green present for Giulia’s debut was a mistake on Shawn Michaels’ part. This could be the recognition that Chelsea feels she deserves. She has been putting stars over herself for quite some time now, while no one else has really been doing the same for her. It’s been over ten years and from the looks of it Chelsea is tired of waiting.There could be trouble brewing in the WWE Women’s division if the officials don’t give Chelsea Green the opportunities she deserves. Hopefully, we’ll get to see a change in her booking in the near future.Also Read: ""She Ruined MY Moment"": WWE Superstar Comments On Being Attacked at NXT","Giulia made her highly anticipated debut this past week on NXT.

Joe Hendry has been making waves in both TNA and WWE , after a crossover was organized between the two promotions earlier this year. While he fought Ethan Page for the NXT Championship at NXT No Mercy, he has also been involved in the TNA title scene. Recently, he teamed up with the legendary ‘ Hardy Boyz ’ at ‘ TNA Emergence ’ and the older Hardy(Matt) is particularly amused by Henry and his entrance shenanigans. Matt Hardy is often heard giving his opinion on several topics around Pro Wrestling and WWE, on the ‘Extreme Life of Matt Hardy’. After recently tagging with TNA superstar Joe Hendry alongside his brother Jeff, Matt has provided anecdotes on that experience and specially the unique entrance style of Joe Hendry, which also involved the Hardy Boyz this time around. It reminded him of his old rivals Edge and his former partner Christian’s “Five Second Pose” which was famous in the ‘Attitude Era’.Talking about making the entrance with Joe Hendry Matt stated “It was cool, because it did go very viral in many ways” recalling the entrance. “And we even got a little spot, where we did the deal, where he did the turn and the big smile. I honestly felt like I was doing Edge and Christian’s ‘Five Second Pose’. It was very instinctual.” Although the Hardy Boyz and Hendry lost that match against the trio of JDC(Eddie Edwards Brian Myers and Moose of the System), the match definitely kept the fans captivated and it was fun to watch the Hardy Boyz tag alongside one of the most popular superstars of today.There have been reports about the Hardy’s joining the NXT brand of WWE, after they expressed their wish to cap off their legendary careers with the NXT Tag Team Championship. There have also been rumors about Joe Hendry completely joining NXT leaving TNA behind, but those reports were put to rest after Henry’s TNA contract was revealed. Joe is contracted with TNA till late 2025 and until he completes that formality, we can’t see him completely switch to WWE. Who would you like to see Joe Hendry go against in WWE next?
