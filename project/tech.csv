The Rumors Behind Musk’s Super Bowl Ad Campaign

Tesla and Electric Vehicles – The Super Bowl could be the perfect stage for Musk to unveil Tesla’s latest advancements, such as the highly anticipated Roadster 2.0 or new self-driving capabilities.



X (formerly Twitter) and Free Speech – Musk has repeatedly positioned X as a platform for unrestricted speech. A Super Bowl ad could promote its vision as the ""everything app.""



Dogecoin and Cryptocurrency – Musk has long been a supporter of Dogecoin. A playful ad could reinforce his support for the cryptocurrency, potentially driving up its value.



SpaceX and the Future of Space Travel – A teaser for the first human mission to Mars or a futuristic ad about space tourism would undoubtedly capture global attention.



Will Musk Attend Super Bowl LIX?

As the excitement builds for Super Bowl LIX , speculation is swirling about whether billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk will make a surprise appearance in the coveted lineup of commercials. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO, known for his unconventional marketing strategies and social media presence, is rumored to be spending a staggering $40 million on multiple Super Bowl ads. But is there any truth to these claims? Here’s what we know so far.Super Bowl commercials are among the most expensive advertising slots in the world, with millions tuning in to watch the spectacle. This year, a viral tweet from a user suggested that Musk is planning to run five commercials during the game, allegedly targeting government spending inefficiencies, particularly through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).Musk has been vocal in his criticism of USAID, calling it a ""viper’s nest of radical-left Marxists"" and questioning its funding. His newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has reportedly been working to expose what he perceives as unnecessary expenditures. While there has been no official confirmation from Musk or his representatives, the billionaire has a history of making bold, unexpected moves, which keeps fans and critics on edge.If Musk were to air a Super Bowl ad, it would likely focus on one of his flagship ventures. Here are a few possible themes:Beyond the ad speculation, there is curiosity about Musk’s presence at the game. He has attended the last two Super Bowls, once alongside media mogul Rupert Murdoch and later with his son, X Æ A-12. With former U.S. President Donald Trump making history as the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl, many wonder if Musk will follow suit, especially given his growing political influence.Whether or not Musk’s ads air during the game, one thing is certain—his presence, both physically and digitally, will be felt at Super Bowl 2025.","Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is rumored to be spending $40 million on Super Bowl ads.

The $25,000 Super Bowl Ring Incident: Did Vladimir Putin Really Steal It?

gifted

""disappeared""

In a hilarious yet wild twist, Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, is asking Russian President Vladimir Putin to return a Super Bowl ring that Putin allegedlyback in 2005. This whole drama resurfaced thanks to the release of Apple TV’s “The Dynasty” series, leaving everyone questioning: Did Putin really just walk off with Kraft's bling? Let’s dive into this strange, almost comical, story.Back in 2005, Kraft was in Russia for a business trip. Naturally, he took his Super Bowl ring along to show off—because who wouldn't, right? He had the world's attention, and Putin was in the room. According to Kraft, he showed the ring to Putin, who then put it on, made a chilling comment like,and then—just like that—took it. Yep, he walked away with it while three KGB agents apparently stood around, making it pretty clear this wasn’t your average “Hey, take a look at my ring” moment.Kraft’s ring was valued at around $25,000, although Super Bowl rings typically range between $30,000 and $50,000. So it’s not exactly a cheap piece of jewelry. Imagine how much cooler it would look in Putin’s collection of other gifts from world leaders, which just so happens to include Kraft’s shiny treasure on display in the Kremlin.After the ring mysteriously disappeared into Russian hands, Kraft publicly asked for it back. But here’s where things get weird. The White House reportedly told him to claim that he hadthe ring to Putin in order to avoid causing any tension in US-Russian relations. Kraft went along with it, stating the ring was a token of respect for the Russian people. However, he later admitted that wasn’t true at all—it was actually the U.S. government’s idea, not his.In the end, Russia insists the ring was a gift, so it's now part of Putin's private collection, safely housed in the Kremlin. But Kraft is not letting go. At a lighthearted event honoring Tom Brady, Kraft humorously asked for the ring back, joking that it hadand was still missing.This story is far from over, and with the public attention now back on it, maybe Kraft will get his bling back after all.Also read - How the Super Bowl Got Its Name: The Surprising Story Behind the Iconic Title","Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, is asking Russian President Vladimir Putin to return a Super Bowl ring that Putin allegedly stole in 2005.

The Super Bowl is bringing all the drama this year. The Kansas City Chiefs face off against the Philadelphia Eagles on February 9, and while fans are hyped about Kendrick Lamar and SZA at halftime, a pre-game performance is sparking serious debate. Grammy winner Ledisi will singthe Black national anthem . Yeah, the same anthem that’s got half of Twitter raging and some NFL fans screaming ""boycott.""This isn’t some random new anthem.was written by James Weldon Johnson in 1899, originally as a poem for Abraham Lincoln’s birthday. His brother, John Rosamond Johnson, composed the music. It was first performed by 500 Black students at a segregated school. By 1919, the NAACP made it their official song, cementing it as a key part of Black cultural identity.Fast forward to 2020—after the killing of George Floyd and the protests that followed, the NFL added the anthem to pre-game ceremonies toCue immediate backlash.For a lot of conservatives, the whole idea of a separate anthem doesn’t sit well. Megyn Kelly fired off last year, saying,But here’s the kicker. For many,is about visibility. Democratic congressman Ritchie Torres summed it up:The NFL is finally acknowledging its messy racial past—something it was forced to confront after Colin Kaepernick’s protests in 2016 shook the league.Ledisi Anibade Young isn’t new to controversy—or greatness. Born in New Orleans and raised in Oakland, she’s been killing it for over 20 years with R&B, gospel, and jazz hits. She’s got Grammy wins and nominations to back it up too. This year, she’ll take center stage withjoining Jon Batiste, who’s handling the national anthem, and Lauren Daigle with Trombone Shorty, singingDespite Ledisi's talent, not everyone is here for it. Social media is already buzzing with outrage. Comments likeare everywhere. Some fans still haven’t forgiven the NFL for taking a stance on race post-George Floyd.This is about more than a song. It’s about the NFL’s ongoing racial reckoning. After sidelining Kaepernick and ignoring police brutality, they can’t just sweep things under the rug anymore. The performance ofsends a message: Black history and voices won’t be erased. Whether fans like it or not, it’s happening.At 52, Ledisi continues to shine in her musical journey. She released her debut album,in 2000 and has since produced 11 studio albums. Her latest,was released just last year. In 2024, she was honored with an honorary doctorate from the prestigious Berklee College of Music.Throughout her career, Ledisi has earned notable accolades, including a Grammy Award in 2021 for Best Traditional R&B Performance with her rendition offrom the 2020 albumShe has also claimed two Soul Train Music Awards.If you can handle the off-field drama, here’s where to catch the game:Super Bowl 59 is setting up to be one hell of a showdown.

Golden State Warriors

“The last time the Warriors won the championship, they had a sweet-shooting European big man on the roster in Nemanja Bjelica,”

“Now, this is not to say that Bojan Bogdanovic is the same player as Bjelica; Bogdanovic has more ball-handling capabilities, while Bjelica is more versatile defensively.”

“Can the Warriors gamble what’s left of their available money on someone who isn’t guaranteed to be an impactful player for them for the stretch run?”



Check out our live coverage of Super Bowl LIX and find details on how to watch Super Bowl live on Times of India.



On Wednesday, themade a historic trade by acquiring Jimmy Butler in a multi-team trade with the Miami Heat. The addition of Butler gave the Warriors an extra layer of star power as they approach the second half of the season. However, despite this high-profile acquisition, Golden State’s roster still has its flaws, particularly in terms of perimeter shooting.To address this issue, the Golden State Warriors may be eyeing a former New York Knicks forward, Bojan Bogdanovic , who could potentially land on the buyout market. Known for his sharp shooting ability, Bogdanovic could offer much-needed support to Stephen Curry and the Warriors’ offensive scheme.Clutch Points’ Jedd Pagaduan wrote Saturday.While the comparison is not perfect, the need for an experienced shooter like Bogdanovic could be significant for the Golden State Warriors, especially with Curry leading the charge.Bogdanovic, who spent the first half of the 2023-24 season with the Detroit Pistons before being traded to the Knicks, has been plagued by injuries, which have limited his time on the court. The 35-year-old forward appeared in 29 regular-season games and four playoff contests with New York, averaging 10.4 points on 37.0% three-point shooting during the regular season. He also posted 6.0 points on 40% three-point shooting in the postseason before a wrist injury and a season-ending foot injury took him out of the lineup.Though he has been cleared for on-court work, it’s unclear if Bogdanovic can fully recover in time to make a major impact.Pagaduan questioned, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the veteran’s health.After undergoing offseason foot surgery, Bogdanovic has not appeared in any games for the Brooklyn Nets this season. Despite this, his reputation as a strong perimeter shooter makes him a potential fit for the Golden State Warriors, a team that relies heavily on long-range shooting. While he may struggle defensively, his ability to space the floor and shoot from deep could provide an immediate offensive boost for Golden State.Also read: NBA Buyout Rumor: Golden State Warriors reportedly eyeing $5.25 million NBA Champion to replace $25 million star guard; better fit for Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler? Now that the February 6 trade deadline has passed, the Warriors ought to give acquiring Bogdanovic serious consideration if he becomes available. He would provide the team with both shooting ability and experience in the last stretch of the season.","Bojan Bogdanovic has not played for the Brooklyn Nets this season.

Super Bowl LIX: Fox's New Scorebug for Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles Sparks Massive Backlash Over Minimalist Design,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/super-bowl-lix-foxs-new-scorebug-for-kansas-city-chiefs-and-philadelphia-eagles-sparks-massive-backlash-over-minimalist-design/articleshow/118102092.cms,"Image via Getty Images

The Super Bowl LIX scorebug by Fox removes traditional elements in favor of a clean design

Fans Said That The Change Was Unnecessary and Made the Game Harder to Enjoy

Fox Introduced Larger Numbers for Readability in 2014 but Super Bowl LIX Viewers Call the New Scorebug Jarring and Ugly

The modernized scorebug design that Fox introduced for Super Bowl LIX triggered widespread controversy. The introduction of oversized and bold typefaces replaced traditional team insignias while Fox believed this change would enhance television viewing enjoyment. Many observers describe the design as ""pretty ugly"" while others consider it an ""abomination to football."" Were fans unequipped to embrace fresh innovations or did this project represent unsuccessful innovative measures? Let’s explore the debate.Fox implemented a distinctive scorebug design during Super Bowl LIX featuring big bold fonts throughout multiple boxes which produced a clean interface for the viewers. Instead of showing traditional team logos Fox displayed only team abbreviations together with scores on the normal scorebug. The simple design approach focused on delivering an uncomplicated user-friendly design.Many viewers objected to the scorebug update that Fox intended to improve because they didn't approve of its appearance. Fans described it using terms such as ""pretty ugly"" as well as ""abomination to the game of football.""Sports fans disliked both the oversized texts and absence of familiar graphical elements as elements that diminished their gameplay experience. People heavily criticized the design and team logo absence because the plain scheme failed to capture the Super Bowl's energetic atmosphere.Fox Sports actively renovates its screen graphics particularly the scorebug in order to enhance fan viewing experiences. In 1994 Fox Sports launched ""FoxBox"" marking a historic moment by displaying the scores and clock time during NFL broadcasts. Since their first ""FoxBox"" introduction in 1994 Fox has periodically updated the scorebug appearance particularly during Super Bowl broadcasts.While these updates are meant to give a modern feel, they haven't always been a hit with fans. Take the 2020 Super Bowl LIV, for instance, when they launched a new scorebug with a pod-like look and stylized player graphics, which got a mixed bag of reactions. Fast forward to 2023, and they rolled out another redesign during Super Bowl LVII, which they called a ""modernized"" version, keeping elements like the pod scoreboard and illustrated player photos.The updated scorebug Fox tested at Super Bowl LIX highlights how challenging it is for broadcasters to introduce modernization approaches that satisfy both broadcast standards and audience liking patterns. Views on this experience reflect the obstacles that exist when trying to merge contemporary design elements with preferred traditional sports broadcasting features.",Fox implemented a distinctive scorebug design during Super Bowl LIX featuring big bold fonts throughout multiple boxes which produced a clean interface for the viewers.

The duo has previously collaborated on tracks like ""30 for 30,"" ""Luther,"" ""Gloria,"" ""All the Stars,"" and ""Doves in the Wind.""Alongside SZA, actor Samuel L. Jackson, dressed as Uncle Sam, made an appearance at the start of the halftime show and was seen multiple times throughout Lamar's performance. Tennis legend Serena Williams also took the stage, dancing, while Mustard performed alongside Lamar. Lamar and Williams, both from Compton, California, achieved great success. Additionally, ""Not Like Us"" is a notorious diss track directed at Drake, with whom Williams had a relationship during the early 2010s.This isn’t Lamar’s first time on the halftime show stage—he was part of the star-studded Super Bowl 2022 lineup featuring Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, Eminem, and 50 Cent.In September, Kendrick Lamar was announced as the headliner for the Apple Music Super Bowl LIX halftime show. The NFL, Apple Music, and Roc Nation revealed the 22-time Grammy Award winner with a promotional video featuring him launching footballs toward the camera using a training machine.Super Bowl LIX will take place at the indoor Caesars Superdome in New Orleans.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Bill Gates admires Jobs

Jobs wished Gates had gone to Ashram

Bill Gates recently shared an anecdote about his interactions with the late Steve Jobs, revealing that the Apple co-founder once suggested he should try acid (commonly known as LSD) to enhance his senses so that he can design better looking products at Microsoft .Gates recounted that Jobs, known for his visionary approach to product design, talked about taking hallucinogenic drugs.“Steve Jobs once said that he wished I’d take acid because then maybe I would have had more taste in my design of my products,” the billionaire told The Independent (via Fortune).Gates, however, dismissed the suggestion, jokingly stating that he had received ""the wrong batch"" – the coding batch instead of the marketing and design batch. He also acknowledged Jobs' superior talent in design and marketing, admitting that those skills were not his forte.“Look, I got the wrong batch,” he said.“I got the coding batch, and this guy got the marketing-design batch, so good for him. Because his talents and mine—other than being kind of an energetic leader, and pushing the limits—they didn’t overlap much,” Gates added.The duo had something of a love-hate relationship while Jobs was alive, but Gates clearly admires the talents of his counterpart.“[Jobs] wouldn’t know what a line of code meant, and his ability to think about design and marketing and things like that… I envy those skills. I’m not in his league,” he said, heaping praise on the Apple co-founder.Jobs had previously made similar comments about Gates in a 2011 biography, suggesting that Gates would be “a broader guy if he had dropped acid once or gone off to an ashram when he was younger.”Gates also revealed that he had experimented with marijuana in his youth but stopped using recreational drugs when he began working on Microsoft, explaining that it made his mind “sloppy.”“I thought maybe I would look cool and some girl would think that was interesting. It didn’t succeed, so I gave it up,” Gates added“Another thing about my personality is that I like my mind to work and be very logical. So I stopped … because it made my mind sloppy, either during or the day afterwards,” Gates noted.","Bill Gates revealed that Steve Jobs once suggested he try acid to enhance his senses so that he can design better looking products at Microsoft.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it

The New York Times made history on February 15, 1942, by publishing its first crossword puzzle in the Sunday Magazine. Created by Charles Erlenkotter and edited by Margaret Farrar, this marked the paper as the first major U.S. publication to feature a crossword. The decision sparked a cultural shift, making puzzles a beloved pastime for readers. Over the decades, the NYT has expanded its puzzle offerings to include the Mini Crossword (2014) and popular games such as Spelling Bee, Letter Boxed, and Tiles. In 2022, the paper acquired Wordle, which became a global sensation. Building on this momentum, it later introduced games like Connections and Strands, capturing the interest of a growing community of players worldwide. The NYT continues to innovate in the puzzle space, cementing its position as a leader in engaging, mind-challenging entertainment for people of all ages and backgrounds, uniting puzzle enthusiasts across the globe.Having trouble solving today’s NYT Strands puzzle?

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.

Thousands of PlayStation users faced widespread connectivity issues on Friday evening as the PlayStation Network (PSN) experienced a severe global outage. The disruption, which began at approximately 5:20 PM ET, left many gamers unable to access online services, log into their accounts, or make purchases on the PlayStation Store. Reports of server failures surged, reaching their peak at 5:49 PM ET, with Down Detector registering over 68,000 complaints within a short period.The outage led to significant frustration among players, particularly as it occurred during peak gaming hours when many users were returning home from work or school.A large percentage of affected users reported issues with server connectivity, while others faced difficulties logging into their PlayStation accounts. Sony acknowledged the disruption on its official PlayStation Network status page, stating that they were aware of the issue and working to resolve it as soon as possible. However, no official explanation has been provided regarding the cause of the outage or a timeframe for full service restoration. This unexpected downtime has left many gamers unable to access their favorite multiplayer games, cloud saves, and digital content, leading to widespread speculation about whether the issue was caused by maintenance, a technical glitch, or a more significant underlying problem.The outage disrupted essential PlayStation services, preventing users from engaging in various online activities. Many players reported being unable to log into their PSN accounts, access their friends lists, or join multiplayer games. Online-based titles such as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Fortnite, Grand Theft Auto Online, EA FC 24, and Destiny 2 were rendered inaccessible, leaving competitive gamers particularly frustrated.Additionally, players attempting to make purchases on the PlayStation Store encountered difficulties, with transactions failing or the store failing to load entirely.

Microsoft’s AI-powered “first line of defense against scams” is now available for these users,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsofts-ai-powered-first-line-of-defense-against-scams-is-now-available-for-these-users/articleshow/118029154.cms,"What is a scareware scam

How does Microsoft’s scareware blocker work



Check out our live coverage of Super Bowl LIX and find details on where to watch Super Bowl 2025 live on Times of India.

Microsoft has started to roll out a new feature in its Edge browser called “scareware blocker” to protect users from increasingly sophisticated online scams, particularly those employing scareware tactics . The company announced the feature at its Ignite conference last November and is now inviting users to preview and test it.Scareware scams employ aggressive web pages designed to deceive users into believing their system is infected with malware. These scams often pressure victims to call fake tech support numbers, potentially leading to financial loss and compromised personal information.Microsoft says that its data revealed a significant rise in online scams, with Edge blocking five times more scams in 2024 compared to just three years prior. While Edge currently utilizes Microsoft Defender SmartScreen to block known scams, the new scareware blocker aims to provide a proactive defense against emerging threats.Microsoft says that its scareware blocker leverages a machine learning model to identify the characteristics of scareware scams and empowers users to regain control of their browsing experience.“Scareware blocker adds a new, first line of defense to help protect the users exposed to a new scam if it attempts to open a full screen page. Scareware blocker uses a machine learning model that runs on the local computer. The model uses computer vision to compare full screen pages to thousands of sample scams that the scam-fighting community shared with us. The model runs locally, without saving or sending images to the cloud,” Microsoft said.Users can then choose to report the malicious site to Microsoft, contributing to the improvement of Defender SmartScreen's ability to detect and block similar scams across the web. Users can also report false positives, helping to refine the scareware blocker's accuracy and reduce the likelihood of legitimate pages being mistakenly blocked.",Microsoft has started to roll out a new feature in its Edge browser called “scareware blocker” The feature aims to protect users from increasingly sophisticated online scams.

"DeepSeek iPhone app has multiple security flaws, mobile security company claims",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/deepseek-iphone-app-has-multiple-security-flaws-mobile-security-company-claims/articleshow/118027132.cms,"Security flaws discovered in DeepSeek’s iPhone app







“The DeepSeek iOS app globally disables App Transport Security (ATS) which is an iOS platform-level protection that prevents sensitive data from being sent over unencrypted channels. Since this protection is disabled, the app can (and does) send unencrypted data over the internet,”

“While none of this data taken separately is highly risky, the aggregation of many data points over time quickly leads to easily identifying individuals. The recent data breach of Gravy Analytics demonstrates this data is actively being collected at scale and can effectively de-anonymize millions of individuals,”

“The encryption algorithm chosen for this part of the application leverages a known broken encryption algorithm (3DES) which makes it a poor choice to protect the confidentiality of data,”

“[A sample user] is operating on the latest iPad, leveraging a cellular data connection that is registered to FirstNet (American public safety broadband network operator) and ostensibly the user would be considered a high value target for espionage. Bear in mind that not only are 10’s of data points collected in the DeepSeek iOS app but related data is collected from millions of apps and can be easily purchased, combined and then correlated to quickly de-anonymise users,”

The DeepSeek app has been popular among iPhone users since its launch and even topped the App Store charts in the US. However, a mobile security company has discovered multiple new security vulnerabilities in the app offered by the Chinese AI startup. These flaws are considered more severe than a previous security issue that exposed chat history and sensitive data due to a lack of database authentication. However, the company didn’t fully disclose the extent of the new vulnerabilities and their potential impact.The security flaws in DeepSeek’s iPhone app were discovered by the mobile security company NowSecure. One of the vulnerabilities includes the lack of Apple’s built-in App Transport Security (ATS). ATS is meant to protect sensitive personal data by ensuring it is transmitted only over encrypted channels. The company claims to have discovered that DeepSeek had disabled this feature on its iPhone app.NowSecure said in a blog post.The company said that even though the exposed data may seem harmless, it can be easily combined to reveal a user's identity.the company added.NowSecure also noted that even though DeepSeek does encrypt data, it uses an outdated method that is known to have security flaws.the company continued.Moreover, the company also said that the data gathered by DeepSeek’s iPhone app can help identify potential targets for spying.the company explained.",The DeepSeek app has been popular among iPhone users since its launch and even topped the App Store charts in the US.
