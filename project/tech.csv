Cardi B Turns Her Umbilical Cord Into GOLD!

More coverage on Cardi B and Stefon Diggs:

The placenta forms an extraordinary bond between mother and child, with the umbilical cord as their lifeline of silent conversation. When the baby arrives, the placenta follows, marking the end of this quiet connection. For nine months, mother and baby shared unspoken messages through this remarkable link, only to part with it at birth. But what if that connection could last a lifetime? That is probably the vision behind Mommy Made Encapsulation, a service that allows mothers to preserve their placenta forever. Such preservation was chosen by Cardi B , partner of New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs The couple recently welcomed a baby boy into their lives. Following the heartfelt tradition, she began with her third child, daughter Blossom, in October 2024, the Grammy-winning rapper chose to honor her fourth child with Diggs in November 2025 in a similar way. She entrusted Mommy Made Encapsulation to transform her pregnancy journey into cherished keepsakes, capturing the memorable moments when her baby was still growing inside her. The company crafted a heart-shaped gold pendant from the baby’s umbilical cord and turned the placenta into nourishing vitamins to support her post-partum recovery.Curious about how the gold pendant comes to life? The process begins with careful cleaning of the placenta, followed by a wash with blue dye that highlights its unique texture.After another rinse, the technician gently separates the placenta from the umbilical cord. The cord, now a striking blue, is shaped around a heart-shaped metal ring, with any extra length trimmed away. Finally, the piece is dipped in shimmering gold chrome, transforming it into a gleaming keepsake. The company describes it as a way to honor the first bond between mother and child. According to the company’s website, “The umbilical cord keepsake is your baby’s umbilical cord dehydrated in the shape of a heart and then dipped in gold chrome. The end result looks and feels like metal and is the perfect way to honor the first connection you shared with your baby.” It costs $50.The “AM I THE DRAMA?” creator took things a step further by having her placenta turned into vitamin capsules. That’s not all. She also tried something called a Placenta Print. The process starts with cleaning the placenta and dyeing it blue to look like a tree. Then, a sheet of paper is pressed on top to make the company’s signature Placenta Print, which costs $65. Their website explains that the print is made by painting the placenta with food-grade coloring (one gets to choose the colors) and stamping it onto a 12-by-18-inch poster to create a Tree of Life painting. After the print is made, the placenta receives a fresh rinse before its transformation into capsules begins. Lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and ginger are added to the raw placenta.The website explains that the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) method is used, with careful steaming at 220 degrees F for 30 minutes to ensure safety. Bacteria and viruses cannot survive at temperatures higher than 131 degrees F. Although, it loses some of the nutritional benefits when steamed, no research determins how much is lost. The placenta is a powerful organ, and all the mothers who have received capsules from Mommy Made Encapsulation still rave about its effects and feel its power. The placenta is gently steamed in specially designed steaming bags made up of heat-resistant, FDA-approved nylon, safe for cooking and free of BPA. Once steamed, the placenta is dried, ground into a fine powder, and sealed into capsules.Each placenta yields 160-180 pills, which, when taken regularly, can offer many benefits for new mothers, such as increased energy levels, reduced post-natal bleeding, lesser chance of baby blues, balanced mood and hormone levels, increased milk supply, lesser chance of post-partum depression, higher iron levels, uterus returning back to pre-pregnancy size faster, losing baby weight faster, and enhanced bonding experience with the baby. The nutrients found in placenta are vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin E, iron, cytokines, and stem cells.The capsules are available in a variety of flavors, including strawberry, orange, bubblegum, lime, berry, grape, and a vegan option. According to the website, these capsules never expire. They just need to be kept at room temperature and in a dry place. The pills can be taken with other medications. The cost of encapsulation starts at $500. This never-heard-before ritual has even captured the curiosity of stars like Megan Fox and Vanessa Hudgens , who, like Cardi B, have embraced the trend of creating placenta keepsakes.Mommy Made Encapsulation was founded by mother-of-four Juliane Corona in 2016. Juliane and her team have encapsulated for over 40,000 moms, including celebrity clients such as Brittany Nassif, Jacqie Rivera, Alondra Dessy, Molly Brazy, Leslie Hernandez, Gemma Farrell, Adizia Benzon, Andrea Espada, Brittani Boren, and more.",The Grammy-winning rapper entrusted Mommy Made Encapsulation to transform her pregnancy journey into cherished keepsakes.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff has declared that he will not use ChatGPT, the AI chatbot developed by Microsoft-backed AI company OpenAI . His comments came after he used Google’s latest AI model, Gemini 3.0, stating that a two-hour experience with Google’s new model has convinced him to switch permanently. Google CEO Sundar Pichai termed the Gemini 3 as the company’s “most intelligent model, that combines all of Gemini’s capabilities together so you can bring any idea to life. ”In a post on X, Benioff claimed that Gemini 3.0 has brought a monumental shift in the AI landscape.

Common mistakes when restoring old photos with Google Nano Banana Pro

Also read|





There is something magical about rediscovering an old, worn photograph. The soft yellows, the creases, the fading edges and the stubborn scratches hold stories that feel too precious to lose. Until recently, restoring these photos required hours of painstaking manual editing. Now Google Nano Banana Pro has made that process far easier. With the right prompts and a bit of creative direction, you can revive portraits, repair damage, and bring lost details back to life in a way that looks natural and polished. Whether you are working with a family album or a treasured vintage snapshot, this tool gives you professional level results with far less effort.Google Nano Banana Pro uses advanced diffusion modelling and context-aware reconstruction. In simple terms, it analyses each pixel, predicts missing details and rebuilds textures so the restored image looks authentic rather than overly sharpened. It also understands lighting, skin tones, shadows and colour balance, which makes it one of the most reliable tools for repairing vintage portraits. Instead of plastic-looking edits, you get subtle, human-like restoration that respects the original photo.The model also handles very damaged images. Torn edges, fold marks, grainy patches and faded backgrounds can be reconstructed automatically. For photos from the 70s and 80s, which often have tinted colour casts, the tool balances hues without making the image look artificial.Using this model effectively comes down to guiding it with clear prompts. Here are prompt structures that work well for damaged or faded photos:“Restore this old photograph with natural colours, clean details and accurate lighting. Remove scratches, stains and noise while keeping the original style.”“Reconstruct the face gently, retain natural skin texture, preserve original expressions and repair damaged areas without over-smoothing.”“Neutralise yellow tint, improve contrast, balance highlights and shadows, and restore film-like tones.”“Rebuild missing or torn sections, reconstruct textures, recover facial features accurately and maintain the vintage feel of the image.”You can also add extra artistic instructions such as “keep grain minimal” or “retain film quality”. The more specific you are, the more consistent the results.To ensure your restored photos look natural, keep these expert guidelines in mind:It is tempting to eliminate all grain, but older photographs naturally have texture. Leave a little grain to maintain the vintage character.For very old family photographs, match the restored colours with reference images from that era. For example, mid-century colour palettes often used softer reds and muted greens.Shadows anchor a photograph. If you remove too many shadows or highlights, the restored image may look flat. Let the model repair damage, but keep the original lighting structure intact.While the model handles most reconstruction automatically, sometimes background objects can appear too clean. Adjusting the prompt to “preserve background imperfections” can solve this.Many beginners make the error of giving vague prompts like “fix this photo”. This causes incorrect smoothing, unnatural facial features or oddly bright colours. Another mistake is using portrait prompts for landscape images, which can distort objects. Over-sharpening is also common, resulting in a digital rather than vintage look. Always compare the original and restored versions side by side to ensure the emotional tone remains the same. This helps you refine edits, preserve important details, and maintain the original atmosphere that gives the photograph its distinctive authenticity.Photo restoration is more than fixing pixels. It is a way of honouring memories that might otherwise fade. With Google Nano Banana Pro and the right prompt strategy, you can bring old pictures back to life while preserving their history and charm. A few careful edits and a well-structured prompt are often all it takes to rebuild details, refresh colours and revive treasured moments. If you have a box of old photographs waiting to be restored, this tool is a gentle and precise way to begin.","Google Nano Banana Pro uses advanced diffusion modelling and context-aware reconstruction.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

China building nuke-proof floating island: Mega project has 2028 deadline; what will it be used for?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-building-nuke-proof-floating-island-mega-project-has-2028-deadline-what-will-it-be-used-for/articleshow/125490383.cms,"Representative AI image

A look into the project



Where will it be located







China has reportedly begun constructing a massive floating artificial island designed to withstand a nuclear strike, a project that signals a major escalation in the global race for maritime power. Chinese state-linked researchers describe the structure as a new “mega science infrastructure,” underscoring Beijing’s push to expand its strategic capabilities at sea.The 78,000-tonne semi-submersible twin-hull platform is described as the world’s first mobile, self-sustaining artificial island.“We’re racing to complete the design and construction, aiming for operational status by 2028,” Lin Zhongqin, an academician leading the project, was quoted as saying in an interview with Economic Information Daily in April last year.The structure is reported to have a displacement comparable to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy’s new Fujian aircraft carrier and can accommodate up to 238 personnel for four months without resupply. When operational in 2028, it is expected to offer extended endurance and significant reach across contested waters, as cited by the South China Morning Post.However, behind its scientific purpose is a nuclear-blast-resistant design that, according to researchers associated with the project, employs “metamaterial” sandwich panels engineered to absorb catastrophic shock waves and reduce them to manageable pressure.“This deep-sea major scientific facility is designed for all-weather, long-term residency,” the research team led by Professor Yang Deqing of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) noted in a peer-reviewed research paper.Its superstructure also reportedly houses essential systems for emergency power, communications and navigation control, making nuclear blast protection for these areas crucial.According to design contracts signed in December 2024 between Shanghai Jiao Tong University and China State Shipbuilding Corporation, the platform will span 138 metres in length and 85 metres in width, with its main deck positioned 45 metres above the waterline. Its twin-hull structure is engineered to operate in sea state 7 conditions, featuring waves up to nine metres, and to withstand typhoons rated as high as category 17, the strongest classification for tropical cyclones.Unlike fixed stations or ships constrained by fuel and supplies, the platform can travel at 15 knots while supporting more than 100 researchers engaged in continuous deep-sea observation, equipment testing and seabed resource studies.The facility also signals China’s push to advance its “blue economy” agenda, including deep-sea resource extraction, marine renewable energy and climate research.The facility is expected to operate in areas that may include contested waters such as the South China Sea , a region rich in untapped mineral resources and biodiversity.Although presented as a civilian project, it references GJB 1060.1-1991, a Chinese military standard for nuclear blast protection, indicating potential dual-use objectives, as cited by the Daily Mail.","The 78,000-tonne semi-submersible twin-hull platform is described as the world’s first mobile, self-sustaining artificial island.

Premium Dining: Other high-view venues like The Meat Co charge a minimum spend of Dh5,000 for a lower terrace seat.

Fast Food, High Price: Even the casual spots get in on the action! You can expect to pay around Dh2,200 per person for a ""gold table"" (outdoor view) at places like Five Guys (unlimited burgers and shakes included!). Other casual dining outdoor spots like TGI Fridays start around Dh3,000.

The Small Catch: When booking a restaurant package, remember a critical detail: most restaurants on The Dubai Mall Promenade and Souk Al Bahar are dry venues, meaning they are unable to serve alcohol. Confirm your beverage package before you book if a celebratory drink is part of your NYE plan.

Funded by Zakat: Uniquely, the program’s funding comes primarily from Zakat, the mandatory Islamic charity, ensuring that the support is distributed to those determined to be truly deserving.

A Safety Net with a Ladder: Unlike old welfare systems, this new structure focuses on rehabilitation, training, and employment. The system categorizes beneficiaries and implements empowerment plans to help those able to work transition from reliance on aid to becoming productive contributors to the economy.

Key Timeline: The modern, enhanced program was introduced in 2022, marking a significant upgrade from the previous system.

What to do if your eligibility hasn’t appeared?

Not visible yet? If the eligibility option is missing, your application likely hasn’t been finalised. Wait until the eligibility-review window (completed by the 9th) closes.

Check carefully: Re-enter credentials and ensure you selected the correct programme page (الضمان الاجتماعي).

Still stuck: Contact HRSD through the official portal, the ministry’s support channels, or their verified social accounts for help. News outlets repeatedly advise avoiding rumours and relying only on the ministry’s official site for status and payment confirmation.





The Developed Social Security System (الضمان الاجتماعي المطور), known locally as ""Dhaman Al Ijtima'i Al Mutawwar,"" is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's core financial safety net. Overseen by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development (HRSD), this comprehensive program goes beyond simple aid by focusing on both immediate financial support and long-term empowerment.It aims to achieve the goals of Vision 2030 by ensuring that cash support reaches the most vulnerable while simultaneously transitioning recipients toward financial independence.“Ahlīyatuk” refers to the eligibility result for the developed Social Security (الضمان الاجتماعي المطوّر) program administered by Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development (HRSD). The eligibility check tells applicants whether their support request was approved for the current cycle or if further documentation is needed. This is the single monthly status beneficiaries watch to know if they will receive that month’s cash disbursement. The primary goal of the Developed Social Security program is to alleviate poverty and guarantee that eligible families and individuals secure a minimum monthly income for basic needs.Follow these exact steps to see your eligibility quickly:If the eligibility page or button does not appear, it usually means your application has not yet been processed, the Ministry says eligibility reviews are completed before the 9th of each Gregorian month.Applicants should wait until that window closes before checking again.HRSD has a fixed disbursement routine: approved beneficiaries generally receive their social security payment on the 1st day of each Gregorian month. For example, the news guidance confirms the December 2025 payment is scheduled for 1 December 2025; rumors of early payouts are false, the Ministry has said. Use the HRSD payments page to confirm the deposit date and transaction details.A clear, fast eligibility check reduces anxiety for applicants and cuts the spread of false claims about early payments or changed dates. Using the official HRSD platform and following the exact steps above ensures beneficiaries know their status accurately and can take corrective action if additional documentation is required.","The Developed Social Security System (Dhaman Al Ijtima'i Al Mutawwar) is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's core financial safety net.

Abu Dhabi Island



Major city arteries and urban zones



Key entry points like Al Maqta Bridge and Mussafah Bridge



The December 1 rule

Purpose: To accommodate smooth traffic flow and major public events during extended national holidays.



Vehicles Restricted: Typically includes trucks, lorries, and large buses used for transporting workers (50 or more passengers).



Duration Example: A typical holiday ban might run from Friday (mid-day) through Monday (early morning). For instance, restrictions have been implemented from 12:00 PM on Friday, December 1, until 1:00 AM on Monday, December 4.



Locations Affected: Entrances to Abu Dhabi Island, including Sheikh Zayed Bridge, Sheikh Khalifa Bridge, Mussafah Bridge, and Al Maqta Bridge.



Enforcement and compliance

Mandatory Permits: Companies must obtain a freight transport permit from the ITC to operate legally in the Emirate.



Digital Tracking: Vehicles must install electronic tracking devices linked to the ""Asateel"" system. This enables authorities to monitor vehicle location in real-time and ensure compliance with designated routes and restricted hours.



Validity: Operator permits are valid for one year, and driver permits are valid for two years, requiring timely renewal.







The Integrated Transport Centre (ITC) in Abu Dhabi has rolled out essential restrictions on heavy vehicle movement, fundamentally changing logistics planning in the emirate. This move is a strategic step to curb traffic congestion, enhance public safety, and protect vital road infrastructure. These regulations apply across major city roads and entry points, requiring all transport operators to strictly adhere to the revised schedules.To manage the significant volume of daily traffic, the ITC, under Abu Dhabi Mobility, enforces clear ""no-entry"" times for heavy vehicles. The updated rules primarily target freight trucks, large tankers, and construction equipment, aiming to separate slower-moving, heavier traffic from light vehicles during the busiest commuting periods. This separation is crucial, as the interaction between vehicle types often leads to speed variation and accidents.Crucial Locations Affected:This timing is carefully calculated to reduce delays for commuters, allowing emergency and public transport vehicles to move efficiently during rush hours.The original restriction linked to the beginning of December often refers to a temporary, extended ban implemented during national holidays or long weekends, such as the UAE Union Day celebrations.Key Details of Temporary Bans:Exemptions: In both permanent and temporary scenarios, crucial vehicles are usually excluded from the ban, specifically those needed for public sanitation services and vehicles carrying logistical support or essential utilities.Adherence to these rules is mandatory and monitored by the Abu Dhabi Police using advanced systems. Violations are tracked digitally, and non-compliance results in significant penalties, including fines and potential vehicle impoundment for repeat offenders.To streamline and monitor commercial movement, the ITC introduced the ""Asateel"" platform.What Logistics Operators Need to Know:The integration of smart systems ensures that these traffic regulations are not just policies on paper but are actively enforced in the digital and physical traffic landscape of the capital. The ITC and Abu Dhabi traffic authorities will enforce the restrictions; drivers found in breach may face regulatory action under traffic law. The ITC has released maps and alternative-route guidance to help compliance.

“Tommy just lost 50% of his supporters with this one move!”

“Nick Fuentes defends extremism abroad while aiming at the wrong targets at home.”

“People are saying the timing of his Israel trip explains everything — and it’s no coincidence.”

“Fuentes is a Qatari-backed spy-op sent to split the movement — wake up!”

“Shouldn’t you be focusing on England instead of picking fights online?”

“He’s part of the very system he claims to fight against.”

“Fuentes has answered the January 6 question countless times — stop trying to paint him as a fed.”

“America has no idea how Islamic communities operate — Tommy needs to get on US podcasts and explain it.”

“Fuentes has no clue what it’s like living near Islamic neighbourhoods — he’s speaking from a bubble.”

Trump To FIRE Kash Patel As FBI Director? White House Denies, Slams ‘FAKE’ MS NOW Report





New Zealand security officials were in a fix as they did not know what to do with the gifts that they received from FBI chief Kash Patel. The gifts were revolvers and possessing them in New Zealand is illegal. They had to destroy the American gift but now reports have confirmed that they were inoperable, inspired by toy Nerf guns, which are popular among amateur 3D-printed weapons hobbyists. Still, they are illegal in New Zealand. Patel took those gifts with him as a goodwill gesture when he flew to the country to officially open an FBI office in Wellington.Documents obtained by The Associated Press identified the model as the Maverick PG22, a working revolver modelled on the brightly coloured toy. Five New Zealand officials received the guns and they voluntarily surrendered them to the government. Following their surrender, internal police communications confirmed the items met the legal definition of firearms, with 3D-printed weapons treated identically to conventional guns in New Zealand.After Patel gifted those guns, police armory team leader Daniel Millar emailed his bosses explaining the guns could become operable by following simple stemps.“These processes are very straight forward processes and require minimal skills and common ‘handyperson’ tools,” Millar wrote. He added that these tools were “a battery drill and a drill bit for the holes and a small screw for the firing pin.”Online instructions for making the Maverick PG22 say it “does not feature proper modern safeties and should be used in a controlled environment.” It’s unclear who manufactured Patel’s guns, which Millar wrote had been “manufactured to a high standard.”","FBI chief Kash Patel gave New Zealand security officials revolvers as a goodwill gesture.

What trains can passengers look forward to in the coming years? What will be the features of these trains and rollout timelines? We explore:

Vande Bharat Sleeper Trains

PM Modi Flags Off Four Vande Bharat Express Trains From Varanasi, Says ‘New India On Fast Track’

Vande Bharat Sleeper

What are the expected features of the Vande Bharat sleeper train?

The first prototype of the Vande Bharat sleeper train has 16 passenger coaches - this includes 11 AC 3 tier coaches, 4 AC 2 tier coaches, and one AC First class coach.

The new train is capable of running at 160 kmph (testing speed 180 kmph) making it a semi-high speed train. However, most stretches on the Indian Railways network do not allow for such high train speeds.

Taking inspiration from European trains, the Vande Bharat sleeper train will have cushioned berths with enhanced comfort. The upper berth access has been redesigned for easier climbing.

The new train will have special night lights, integrated announcement systems with visual displays, CCTVs, and modular pantry units.

The train will feature modern bio-vacuum toilets, similar to those is aircrafts. There will also be a toilet for disabled passengers, which will also have a baby care station. The AC First class will include shower facilities with hot water provision.

The Vande Bharat sleeper train is equipped with the indigenous KAVACH anti-collision system. Like the chair car versions, the sleeper variant makes use of regenerative braking technology for optimal energy usage.

The coaches have automatic interconnecting doors. The gangways are sealed completely to maintain clean air and effective temperature control.

Each coach has individual reading lights, charging points, refreshment tables, and GFRP panel interiors. The train doors open automatically at the designated station.

The train has a Centralised Coach Monitoring System. Emergency communication systems connect passengers with the driver.

India is also looking to manufacture its own bullet train

Train travel in India is a vibe, with Indian Railways transporting millions of passengers. With the launch of the Vande Bharat Express trains a few years ago, Indian Railways has aimed to change the face of train travel, and several more new train projects are expected to deliver in 2026. While Vande Bharat - a chair car train set - has attempted to transform the day travel experience, there is growing demand for better, faster and more comfortable trains for overnight travel.In this regard, the Vande Bharat sleeper train project - launched a few years ago in the hope of rolling out an experience more premium than the Rajdhani Express trains - may prove to be a game changer. Simultaneously, Amrit Bharat Express and NaMo Bharat trains are expected to make travel faster and more comfortable for the common man. India may also soon see its very own, indigenous bullet train Over 200 Vande Bharat sleeper trains are expected to be rolled out in the coming years as Indian Railways looks to revamp long-distance train travel. Three major projects are currently in the works: BEML is manufacturing 10 Vande Bharat sleeper train sets with the help of ICF; Indo-Russian joint venture Kinet has been tasked with rolling out 10 train sets; and a Titagarh-BHEL consortium will make 80 Vande Bharat sleeper trains.Additionally, ICF is also looking to roll out its own version of the Vande Bharat sleeper train soon.The first prototype of the Vande Bharat sleeper train project awarded to BEML was originally supposed to be ready in the first half of 2024. Several deadlines have since then been missed. Two prototype rakes have been manufactured by BEML. Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has said that the Vande Bharat sleeper train requires 'minor' retrofitting. He believes that they will be launched in December.Sharing details about the Vande Bharat sleeper train projects, Integral Coach Factory (ICF) GM U Subba Rao told TOI, “Initially, we have given orders for 10 trains to BEML. The first prototype came out a few months back. We wanted some upgradations and improvements in the train so the second rake has come to us with the changes.”“We have already given BEML the go ahead for the other eight trains. The Railway Board will take the call on whether the two rakes will be launched together. From here on, BEML may manufacture one train a month,” he said.ICF too is looking to manufacture its own variant of the Vande Bharat sleeper. “We are working on a 24 car rake, which will be one of the longest sleeper trains being produced in India. We are working on the designs. It is slightly different from what BEML has produced, because we are trying to increase the number of toilets since it’s a long-distance train,” U Subba Rao said.“We also plan to have a pantry car for food to be heated up and served, which is not available in the other version of Vande Bharat sleeper. So, the configuration is slightly different. We are also trying to improve upon the interiors…we are on the drawing board right now,” he added.So when does ICF plan to roll out its own version of the Vande Bharat sleeper train?“Major assemblies have been ordered. For example, the propulsion system has already been ordered, and other major assemblies like doors and brake systems, the tender is going to be floated anytime soon. Specifications have been kind of finalized. By December 2026 we are targeting that the prototype Vande Bharat sleeper rake should be ready,” he said.Meanwhile, Kinet recently unveiled the design of the First AC coach of the Vande Bharat sleeper train. The production is expected to begin at Indian Railways’ Latur factory soon.Even as it launches a premium long-distance train, Indian Railways is also looking to introduce more modern trains for the common man. Amrit Bharat trains, first launched in 2023-end will continue to be introduced in the coming years as well. ICF is already rolling out Amrit Bharat 2.0 trains with better comforts compared to the first prototypes.Amrit Bharat Express is a push-pull train with non-AC coaches with a mix of general and second-class sleeper coaches. With a faster acceleration and deceleration, thanks to its push-pull technology, the Amrit Bharat train has a maximum speed of 130 kmph. In the coming months an Amrit Bharat 3.0 train is expected to be rolled out with AC coaches as well.ICF GM U Subba Rao told TOI that there is an order for 100 Amrit Bharat trains. “We have got an order for 50 Amrit Bharat 2.0 trains and 50 more trains will be manufactured by RCF,” he said. “We have already produced 10-12 trains. Two rakes a month, we are producing right now,” he added.Talking about AC coaches for Amrit Bharat Express, he said, “We are trying to introduce the Amrit Bharat 3.0 train as well. We have been asked to make five of those trains. We are working on the designs of the AC coaches. In this financial year, maybe by March 2026, we are trying to introduce the first prototype.”“The features will be similar to Rajdhani Express trains, but also much better because we also worked on non-AC coaches and made them better than the regular non-AC coaches. It’s an ongoing, continuous process,” he added.Several other projects that Indian Railways is working on include NaMo Bharat trains for short-distance inter-city travel, India’s own indigenous bullet train, and a hydrogen train which is a technology demonstrator project. NaMo Bharat trains, already launched on some routes, are a metro-style variant of the Vande Bharat Express trains, capable of 130 kmph speed.“We have produced one NaMo Bharat train, one was produced by RCF, Both are, right now, already in service. The board has decided that RCF will produce the balance 50 trains. We have already done the designing, and the design was shared with RCF, and they also produced the same design, they will continue with the production,” said ICF GM.Indian Railways has also manufactured its, which is expected to be launched soon on the Jind and Sonipat route in Haryana under the Northern Railway. The new train will have speeds of up to 110 kmph.Talking about the hydrogen train Subba Rao told TOI, “Basically this was a technology demonstrator. We tried to demonstrate the Indian capability of producing a hydrogen train. We will run it for some time and then maybe the government of India will take a call (on whether more such trains should be manufactured).”“You know, hydrogen technology is totally new. It's at an initial stage all over the world. So we are working on it. I'm sure it'll be successful,” he said.and a project has been awarded to BEML, in collaboration with ICF for manufacturing two high-speed train sets. The train will be indigenously designed and manufactured.“High speed rail is being manufactured by BEML. We have given the order to BEML - ICF, NHRCL, and BEML are collaborating on that project. The preliminary designs are all ready. They are also finalizing the vendors for all the sub-assembles and all important components. Orders are also being placed,” Subba Rao shared.“The final designs will be done and once some components arrive the manufacturing of the prototype car body will start. By early 2027, the first train should be running,” he added.Talking about the India-specific features of the bullet train, the ICF GM said, “It will be an air-conditioned chair car train suited for Indian conditions. Tropicalization has to be done. That's why designing the train within India is very important, since we know the conditions much better. In Europe, it is very cold, so they had to concentrate more on heating systems, whereas in India it is quite hot. So we have to concentrate on the AC system. So that's one of the basic differences.”“The second difference is our country is quite dusty, so that aspect also has to be taken into account. The filters have to be much better so that the air quality inside the coach is acceptable,” he added.With Vande Bharat sleeper trains, newer versions of Amrit Bharat Express, NaMo Bharat, bullet trains, and hydrogen trains in the pipeline, passengers can hope for better travel experience in the coming years.","Vande Bharat sleeper train will have cushioned berths with enhanced comfort.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets. The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Meet Charlie Javice: Woman who scammed JP Morgan for $175M — but the bank is paying her $142M legal bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meet-charlie-javice-woman-who-scammed-jp-morgan-for-175m-but-the-bank-is-paying-her-142m-legal-bills/articleshow/125369591.cms,"How a startup deal turned into a massive fraud

A conviction that didn’t stop the bills

The controversial expenses

Why JPMorgan cannot simply stop paying

Charlie Javice’s story sounds almost too bizarre to be real: a young fintech founder who tricked JPMorgan into buying her startup for $175 million, ended up convicted of fraud, and is now serving a prison sentence, yet the same company she scammed is still paying more than $142 million for her legal bills, including questionable expenses like luxury hotel upgrades and “cellulite butter. ”Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid. When JPMorgan considered acquiring the startup in 2021, she reportedly presented the bank with millions of supposed student user accounts. Prosecutors later revealed that these numbers had been fabricated, with Javice allegedly hiring a data scientist to generate fake profiles to inflate Frank’s value.JPMorgan completed the acquisition believing Frank had more than four million users, only to discover after the deal that the platform had a tiny fraction of that. The bank alerted authorities, and by 2023 Javice was arrested on federal fraud charges.In March 2025, Javice was convicted of multiple fraud counts and sentenced to more than seven years in prison. But here’s where the story takes an unusual twist: despite defrauding the bank, she is still allowed to bill JPMorgan for her legal defence because of an indemnification clause included in the acquisition agreement.This contractual protection, which is common in startup buyouts, requires JPMorgan to cover certain legal costs for former executives of Frank.As a result, the bank has already paid over $142 million in defence expenses for Javice and her former colleague Olivier Amar.The clause itself is a standard feature in mergers, designed to protect executives from being financially ruined by lawsuits connected to their time at the company. In normal situations, it is meant to ensure fairness and prevent frivolous legal targeting after an acquisition. But in this case, it has trapped JPMorgan in a bizarre obligation: they must keep funding the defence of someone who defrauded them.Had the bank conducted even a simple, early-stage verification of Frank’s user data—such as requesting direct access to the platform’s actual customer records or running a basic audit—this entire dispute could have been avoided. Instead, delayed due diligence and overconfidence in the startup’s claims set the stage for a costly legal mess that continues years after the fraud was uncovered.JPMorgan’s frustration has grown as the legal bills have ballooned. The bank claims the expenses submitted include personal items such as cellulite butter, first-class travel upgrades, and hotel luxuries. Its lawyers argue that the billing records contain “extreme abuses,” including claims for work hours that seem physically impossible.Javice’s spokesperson denies that she personally submitted these questionable charges, stating that her legal team is responsible for all billing decisions.Even though Javice has already been convicted, she is now appealing her case, and the indemnification clause means the bank must continue paying her legal fees unless a court orders otherwise. JPMorgan is currently trying to convince a Delaware judge to halt these payments, arguing that the system is being misused.The saga has become a major lesson in the risks of fast-paced startup acquisitions. JPMorgan’s failure to properly verify Frank’s user base before buying the company has left it entangled in one of the most embarrassing and expensive due diligence failures in recent corporate history.","Charlie Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai celebrates new breakthrough in quantum algorithm; Elon Musk replies: ‘Looks like…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-celebrates-new-breakthrough-in-quantum-algorithm-elon-musk-replies-looks-like/articleshow/124754841.cms,"



What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including Squid Game Unleased which hit #1 in 26 countries. You’ll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles – they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through. As for Bill, Scott and me – we’re going to take a little breather before tackling whatever is next. Love to hear from you if there’s anything interesting going on, workwise or otherwise.Another employee, David Luehmann, a director of game development at the studio, also posted on LinkedIn, saying, ""After 10+ great years working at Boss Fight, the last few as part of Netflix, the time has come for the studio to close down.""“I am very proud of all the people, work, and games we've released.

"Google co-founder Larry Page becomes second richest person in the world, Sergey Brin overtakes Jeff Bezos",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-co-founder-larry-page-becomes-second-richest-person-in-the-world-sergey-brin-overtakes-jeff-bezos/articleshow/125592273.cms,"Rank Name Net Worth 1 Elon Musk $476.4B 2 Larry Page $264.9B 3 Larry Ellison $247.4B 4 Sergey Brin $245.6B 5 Jeff Bezos $241.5B

Why Larry Page is richer than Sergey Brin

Alphabet nearing $4 trillion market cap





Google-parent company Alphabet’s sudden rise in stock has triggered a major shakeup in the world’s richest rankings. Google co-founder Larry Page is now the second-richest person globally after leapfrogging Oracle co-founder and CTO, Larry Ellison. Notably, Google co-founder, Sergey Brin , has also moved up, overtaking Amazon’s Jeff Bezos , according to Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List. The surge in wealth saw Page’s net worth increase by $8.7 billion on Monday (November 24) even as investors are optimistic for Alphabet's Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cloud business.Page’s fortune is now estimated at $264.9 billion, moving him past Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison ($247.4 billion), whose net worth has declined following a steep drop in Oracle’s share price. Sergey Brin also climbed the list, passing Jeff Bezos ($241.5 billion) to become the world’s fourth-richest person with an estimated net worth of $245.6 billion.While Page and Brin co-founded Google and hold a combined 87.9% of Alphabet’s Class B (10-votes per share) stock, Page holds significantly more shares (389 million) than Brin (362.7 million). According to Forbes, the gap in equity is attributed to Brin’s philanthropic activity.According to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, Brin actively sold his stake and made donations of his Alphabet and Tesla stock to nonprofit groups and Parkinson's research. He donated $700 million earlier this year, and in 2023, he gave away $615 million and $600 million.This comes as Alphabet is nearing a $4 trillion market capitalisation, after breaching the $3 trillion threshold in September this year. A victory in the Google Chrome case, coupled with Google Gemini 3.0 and Nano Banana Pro AI image generation model boosted the company's valuation in the last three months.Moreover, the news about Meta in talks with Google to use its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for training AI models has also pushed its market cap by 250 billion in a day.","Larry Page is now the second-richest person globally after leapfrogging Oracle co-founder and CTO, Larry Ellison.
