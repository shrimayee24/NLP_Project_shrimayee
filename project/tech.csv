Caitlin Clark’s $150M sneaker hype grows ahead of 2026 signature shoe launch



Caitlin Clark is one of the most well-known figures in women's basketball. Due to her popularity, many brands want to work with her. Her fame helped her sell her signature shoes. Industry insiders estimate that her first signature sneakers could be worth up to $150 million. Earlier this year, she signed a contract with Nike.

Since then, a lot of Clark-branded jerseys, hoodies, T-shirts, and hats have been sold by Nike. However, her official signature shoe is still expected to launch next year.Recently, Nike dropped a special ""Caitlin Clark"" edition of the Kobe V Protro. The shoe, featuring midnight navy, bright crimson, and university gold colors, sold out within minutes after its release.These Clark-themed sneakers have now flooded resale platforms and are being listed for nearly $400 on sites like eBay. Sneaker expert and journalist Nick DePaula talked about this on a recent episode of Front Office Sports Today. He said:“I think when Caitlin’s shoe comes out it can be a $150 million business… It could become a top five signature franchise across basketball.”Given that Nike normally takes two years to create signature models, Caitlin Clark's signature shoe is anticipated to debut in the spring of next year. Nick DePaula further claimed that the company is taking its time and being methodical in the process. He said: “They want to get it right.”At the moment, the WNBA legend is sporting custom Kobe exclusives during games. However, excitement around her signature line continues to build.

Whether one likes it or not, America was built by immigrants, the wretched masses that the Statue of Liberty inscription asks to welcome with open arms. From Albert Einstein to Elon Musk, immigrants made America a great country, and now it looks like they are making America great again (MAGA, as the slogan goes), and this time in artificial intelligence. America’s edge isn’t just its innovation, it's the global brainpower who has been giving an edge to the country for centuries. And nothing makes that clearer than the news out of Meta’s new Superintelligence Lab: 11 top AI researchers hired, and every single one of them is an immigrant.That’s right, not one US undergrad among them. These are elite engineers, model architects, and machine learning pioneers who began their academic journeys in India, China, South Africa, the UK, and Australia. They trained in America’s best labs, built some of the most advanced AI systems at OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic, and now they’ve been snapped up by Zuckerberg to build the next wave of intelligence. If you want to understand why the US leads the world in AI, you don’t need to look at GPUs or model benchmarks. Just look at the passports of the people writing the code.Immigrants have long been the silent engine of Silicon Valley. From coding at Google to architecting cloud infrastructure at Microsoft, they form the backbone of America’s biggest tech empires. A significant number of these engineers hail from India, whose talent pipeline has become essential to the innovation output of the U.S. tech sector. They don’t just fill jobs, they define the direction of the industry. Now, as AI becomes the next great technological frontier, these same minds are shaping the models, algorithms, and safety protocols that will govern its future. Meta’s new superintelligence team is just the latest proof that without immigration, there is no AI revolution.Previously at OpenAIMaster of Science (M.Sc.

A Quiet Stroll Through London

The Royal Family's Strong Connection to London

The Summer 2024 Visit: A More Formal Occasion





Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, was recently spotted in London, where videos of his casual walk through the city have gained attention on social media platforms like TikTok.On July 2, 2025, several videos surfaced online showing Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum casually walking through London. In one clip, he was seen strolling down the city’s streets, exuding his usual calm and composed demeanor. The ruler, without any apparent security entourage or fanfare, appeared completely at ease, blending into the vibrant London environment with little attention.Another video captured Sheikh Mohammed entering a building lobby in the upscale Knightsbridge area. His visit was brief and low-key, reflecting his preference for simplicity and privacy while abroad.Perhaps the most engaging video was captured at a traffic light, where Sheikh Mohammed was seen waiting in his car. A passerby noticed him, waved, and the ruler responded with a brief wave of his own. The interaction was fleeting but highlighted his approachable and down-to-earth nature. The user who shared the video added the caption: ""POV: Chatting with the ruler of Dubai while waiting for a traffic light!"" This light-hearted moment quickly gained traction online, with many viewers noting the ruler’s openness during the casual encounter.The UAE royal family, especially Sheikh Mohammed, has a long-standing relationship with London. Over the years, they have frequently visited the city for both official engagements and personal vacations. London’s cosmopolitan atmosphere, coupled with its strong ties to the UAE, makes it a popular destination for many members of the royal family.In the past, Sheikh Mohammed’s visits have often drawn attention from fans and media alike. His preference for privacy while traveling, however, remains unchanged. The ruler has continued to enjoy his visits without excessive public display, often leaving his presence unnoticed or only becoming known after videos or photos are shared on social media platforms.Sheikh Mohammed’s 2024 trip to London was marked by a more formal event. During that visit, he became the first official guest at the opening of Parker’s London, the UK branch of the popular Dubai-born restaurant chain. His visit was considered a significant moment for the Emirati brand, which proudly shared images of the visit online, underscoring the ruler’s support for local businesses and talent on the international stage.Despite the grandeur of the occasion, Sheikh Mohammed’s presence remained humble, embodying his characteristic simplicity and grace. His continued support for homegrown Emirati talent abroad has become a signature part of his leadership and influence, further cementing his reputation as a grounded leader with a global vision.","Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum was recently spotted in London.

LOS ANGELES: Michael Madsen, whose menacing characters in ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Kill Bill"" made him a standout in Quentin Tarantino's films, has died. He was 66.Madsen was found unresponsive in his home in Malibu, California, on Thursday morning and pronounced dead, Los Angeles county sheriff's department watch commander Christopher Jauregui said. He is believed to have died of natural causes and authorities do not suspect any foul play was involved. Madsen's manager Ron Smith said cardiac arrest was the apparent cause.Madsen's career spanned more than 300 credits stretching back to the early 1980s, many in low budget films. But his most memorable screen moment may have been the sadistic torture of a captured police officer - while dancing to Stealers Wheel's ""Stuck in the Middle with You"" - as Mr. Blonde in 1992's ""Reservoir Dogs."" He would become a Tarantino regular, appearing in the ""Kill Bill"" films and ""The Hateful Eight.""""In the last two years Michael Madsen has been doing some incredible work with independent film including upcoming feature films 'Resurrection Road,' 'Concessions and 'Cookbook for Southern Housewives,' and was really looking forward to this next chapter in his life,"" his managers Smith and Susan Ferris and publicist Liz Rodriguez said in a statement.","Madsen was found unresponsive in his home in Malibu, California, on Thursday morning and pronounced dead.

Dubai: 10-year-old reports father’s abuse through Dubai Police smart app,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-10-year-old-reports-fathers-abuse-through-dubai-police-smart-app/articleshow/122236110.cms,"A 10-year-old boy in Dubai used the Dubai Police Smart App to report his father’s abuse, leading to swift intervention and ongoing support/ Image: File

A Cry for Help Through Technology:



Support from School Social Worker:



Father’s Justification and the Law’s Intervention:



Ongoing Support and Monitoring







In a heartbreaking yet courageous act, a 10-year-old boy in Dubai recently reported his father for repeated physical abuse, utilizing the Dubai Police smart app to seek help. The boy, identified only as A.A. , had been suffering in silence for months, unable to understand the reasons behind the physical punishments or to speak out about the pain he endured. His story, which has now been shared by Dubai Police, serves as a crucial reminder to the public that help is always available and that no child should suffer in silence.A.A.’s situation came to light when he was discreetly able to report his father’s cruelty via the Dubai Police smart app. Although the boy did not fully comprehend why he was being singled out for punishment, especially since his younger siblings were not subjected to the same treatment, the constant beatings left visible bruises on his body and a deep emotional scar. The pain was becoming unbearable, and he feared his classmates would notice. This fear, however, did not stop him from reaching out for help through the app, one of the many confidential channels available for reporting abuse.A.A.’s journey toward safety and healing began when his school noticed troubling signs. Teachers observed that the boy was struggling academically and showing physical signs of abuse. It was a school social worker who gently built trust with A.A. and, after some time, helped him feel comfortable enough to report the abuse through the police app. Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Ali Al Matrooshi, Director of the Child and Women Protection Department at Dubai Police, emphasized the importance of the school's role in identifying signs of abuse and supporting the child in coming forward.Dr. Al Matrooshi stated, “The child was afraid to speak up, but the bruises on his body and the fear on his face spoke volumes.”After receiving the report, Dubai Police acted swiftly, calling in the boy’s father for questioning. During this process, the father admitted to physically punishing his son but insisted that he never intended to cause harm. According to the father, his strict discipline was meant to “toughen up” his son, similar to the way he himself was raised. However, this justification was met with a firm response from the police.Dr. Al Matrooshi explained, “He thought that being strict would prepare his son for life, but instead, it left the child feeling alone, afraid, and falling behind in school.”The police made it clear to the father that such methods of discipline were not only damaging but also illegal under the UAE’s child protection laws. He was warned that corporal punishment and similar forms of abuse are punishable by law. The father expressed regret and promised to change his behavior, pledging to adopt more appropriate methods of parenting.The police have assured that A.A. will receive the necessary emotional support and counseling, in collaboration with social services. Dr. Al Matrooshi reassured the public that Dubai Police are committed to protecting children, providing support, and helping families heal. ""We are here to protect children, listen to them, and help families heal,"" he said.The case serves as a powerful reminder of the resources available to victims of abuse in the UAE. In line with the UAE’s Wadeema Law, which protects child rights, the General Department of Human Rights urges anyone aware of abuse to report it immediately, through the police app, website, or hotline (901). The Child Oasis Center at Al Twar police headquarters is also available for those who need in-person assistance.","A 10-year-old boy in Dubai recently reported his father for repeated physical abuse.

Safety and Nightlife: UAE Cities Shine Globally

The Rise of Noctourism: Travel After Dark

Innovations in Nighttime Experiences: Dubai Leads the Way





A recent study by UK-based travel agency Travelbag has ranked Dubai as the third most scenic city in the world after dark, with Abu Dhabi also making the list at 12th place. The report highlights both UAE cities as global leaders not only in their nighttime beauty but also in safety for nighttime explorers.According to the Travelbag study, Abu Dhabi holds the distinction of being the safest city in the world to explore at night. Dubai also ranks highly, placing among the top three safest cities globally after sunset. This recognition underscores the strong emphasis both cities place on security and creating safe environments for residents and tourists alike.The study examined a range of factors including nightlife offerings and the quality of the urban environment at night. Dubai boasts 190 venues that stay open late, catering to night owls and tourists looking for evening entertainment. However, the city does face challenges with noise and light pollution, scoring 52.58 out of 100 on this scale.Abu Dhabi, on the other hand, has fewer late-night venues, with 62 establishments open late. It recorded a slightly lower pollution rating of 47, reflecting a quieter, less intense nighttime environment.This report taps into a broader trend known as ""noctourism,"" travel experiences and activities designed for after sunset. Booking.com predicts that nighttime travel will be one of the top trends in 2025, with tourists increasingly seeking unique adventures like stargazing and cosmic events in areas with minimal light pollution.Such trends are reflected in Dubai’s growing offerings. Many tours now focus exclusively on nighttime sightseeing, a practical response to the city's hot daytime temperatures. Tour agencies promote night tours that let visitors enjoy Dubai’s spectacular cityscape illuminated under the stars.Late-night desert safaris have also surged in popularity. Travelbag’s research notes a 22 percent jump in searches for night safaris, as tourists seek cooler and more atmospheric desert experiences after dark.To enhance night activities and provide comfort during hot summer months, Dubai Municipality has introduced “night swimming” at three public beaches. This initiative extends beach hours into the cooler night, allowing residents and visitors to enjoy swimming and beach activities without the intensity of daytime heat.These measures, along with the thriving nightlife scene, showcase Dubai’s commitment to making nighttime tourism safe, accessible, and enjoyable.This detailed report was compiled from Travelbag’s latest study, as referenced by multiple news outlets covering travel and urban lifestyle trends.","Dubai and Abu Dhabi ranked among the top three safest cities globally after sunset.

IBAN rules for local and international transfers in Oman have changed: What you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iban-rules-for-local-and-international-transfers-in-oman-have-changed-what-you-need-to-know/articleshow/122210122.cms,"From July 1, 2025, Oman mandates IBAN for all domestic transfers, while international payments no longer require it/ (Representative Image)

IBAN Requirement Extended to Domestic Transfers



Regional Banks Begin Issuing Guidance



What Is IBAN and Why It Matters



It includes country-specific codes (e.g., ""AE"" for the UAE or ""OM"" for Oman), check digits, and the traditional account number.



It serves as a universal identifier, much like a postal code for bank accounts.



It does not replace the local account number but works as an added layer for enhanced accuracy.





The Sultanate of Oman has announced that beginning July 1, 2025, the use of the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) will be mandatory for all domestic financial transactions. This change comes as part of the Central Bank of Oman’s efforts to enhance the efficiency, speed, and accuracy of financial operations within the country.The mandate had already been implemented for international transfers earlier this year, and now it extends to transactions within Oman itself.The Central Bank of Oman had previously made IBAN compulsory for international transfers starting March 31, 2024, and the results have been positive.According to a statement from the Central Bank of Oman, this move has already “significantly improved transaction accuracy, reduced errors, and accelerated processing times for both local and international bank transfers.”Now, beginning July 1, 2025, all domestic financial transfers within Oman must include the IBAN. This means individuals and businesses making local payments between Omani banks will be required to use this standardized format.In a key clarification, the Central Bank also confirmed that international transactions will still be accepted without an IBAN — a change from the previous requirement. This implies more flexibility for foreign entities transferring money into Oman.The regulatory change has also prompted responses from financial institutions in neighboring countries. The Emirates NBD app, a major banking platform in the UAE, has started displaying an awareness message for users sending money to Oman.The advisory on the app states:""In line with new regulatory mandates, IBAN is now a mandatory requirement for all payments to Sultanate of Oman, starting from July 1, 2025.""To ensure compliance, Emirates NBD is urging customers to update beneficiary details. It added:""Please delete and re-add your beneficiaries in Oman using their IBAN to avoid payment failures. Kindly note a cooling period of 4 hours will apply for newly added beneficiaries.""This practical advisory is a proactive step to avoid disruptions and failed transactions once the regulation comes into force.The International Bank Account Number (IBAN) is a globally standardized format for identifying bank accounts across countries. It’s designed to streamline cross-border payments and reduce the chance of errors.Here’s what makes IBAN important:Before the implementation of the IBAN system, banking transactions especially international ones, were prone to delays and costly errors due to inconsistent formats and identifiers. Since its adoption in most of Europe, the Middle East, and parts of the Caribbean, IBAN has proven to be a reliable standard.The Central Bank of Oman’s extension of the IBAN requirement to domestic transactions is expected to align the country further with global best practices, ensuring smoother and safer money transfers.","From July 1, 2025, Oman mandates IBAN for all domestic transfers, while international payments no longer require it.

Humanitarian Efforts to Support Workers in Extreme Heat





As summer temperatures soar up to an intense 50°C in the UAE, local authorities are taking proactive steps to ease the burden of the extreme heat on residents, especially during sensitive occasions like funerals. In a thoughtful move, Al Ain City Municipality has installed portable air conditioners at key cemeteries to provide relief for mourners.Al Ain Municipality has set up these portable coolers in major cemeteries, including the well-known Al Sarooj Cemetery. The aim is to create a more comfortable and respectful environment for grieving families and attendees during funeral prayers.An Emirati citizen shared his experience on Instagram after visiting Al Sarooj Cemetery. He was initially surprised to see several large air coolers near his father’s grave. “I went to visit my father's grave and noticed several large air coolers. I initially thought the family of a deceased person had arranged them,” he said. Upon inquiry, the cemetery guard informed him, “the coolers were provided by Al Ain Municipality, free of charge, to make it easier for people to bear the heat during funeral prayers.Expressing gratitude for this initiative, the visitor added, “Thank God for the blessings of the Emirates and the generosity of its wise leadership.”This initiative clearly highlights the municipality’s commitment to community welfare and improving the quality of public services during harsh weather conditions.Beyond cemetery coolers, the UAE government has implemented several measures to address heat-related challenges during the scorching summer months:In addition to structural and policy initiatives, there are also humanitarian campaigns aimed at providing direct relief to workers enduring the harsh sun:At large construction sites, workers regularly receive cold water, juice, and frozen treats as a welcome respite from the heat.

A Musical Drive: Beethoven on the Road

Artistic Vision: Blending Culture with Infrastructure

A First for the Arab World

Fujairah's Ongoing Cultural Expansion





In a pioneering move for the UAE and the wider Arab world, Fujairah has launched the region’s first “Musical Street”, a public art initiative that transforms a routine drive into a symphonic experience. The project, spearheaded by the Fujairah Fine Arts Academy, reflects the emirate’s growing commitment to integrating art into everyday life and fostering cultural innovation.Located along a 750-metre stretch of Sheikh Khalifa Street, at the entrance of Fujairah City, this unique road produces musical notes as cars drive over it, specifically the iconic melody from Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. The sound is not played through speakers; instead, it is generated by the friction between car tyres and specially engineered grooves on the asphalt. This innovation transforms a regular commute into an immersive musical moment, surprising and delighting motorists.The Musical Street is one of several new initiatives by the Fujairah Fine Arts Academy to bring art into public spaces. It not only serves as a symbol of creativity but also embodies the broader vision of the emirate to infuse daily life with beauty, culture, and artistic expression.Ali Obaid Al Hefeiti, Director General of the Fujairah Fine Arts Academy, described the project as a reflection of Fujairah’s forward-thinking cultural strategy. Speaking about the initiative, he stated:""The Musical Street project is an extension of Fujairah's vision to integrate art into everyday life, offering a unique experience that touches people's senses in unconventional settings.We believe that music is a universal language capable of creating exceptional moments, even while driving.""He further added:""The project connects art to life, embodying the Academy's mission to spread beauty and creativity throughout the emirate, particularly within artistic fields.""This initiative marks the first time such a musical road has been constructed in the Arab world, positioning Fujairah as a regional leader in creative urban planning and experiential public art. While musical roads have been implemented in countries like Japan, South Korea, and the United States, Fujairah's version stands out for its cultural significance and choice of classical music.The Musical Street aims not just to entertain but also to enhance driver awareness, add a sensory layer to road experiences, and reinforce the identity of Fujairah as a hub for the arts.The Fujairah Fine Arts Academy has been instrumental in pushing the boundaries of traditional art presentation. Through innovative projects like this, the Academy hopes to inspire both residents and visitors to engage with art in unexpected ways, reinforcing the idea that culture and creativity belong not only in galleries, but also on streets, in everyday routines, and in community spaces.By launching the Musical Street, Fujairah has taken a bold step toward transforming its urban landscape with a blend of art, music, and daily function, setting a new standard for how cities in the region might weave culture into the fabric of daily life.","Fujairah has launched the region’s first ‘Musical Street’, a public art initiative that transforms a routine drive into a symphonic experience.

Who is Habubu and Why is the UAE Talking About Her?

A New Era for Bigg Boss: AI Enters the Game

Why This Matters for the UAE





Bigg Boss 19 is gearing up for a sensational return this August 2025, and it looks like the show is about to make television history with a bold and futuristic twist. A latest report by India Forums suggests that UAE’s first interactive AI robot doll, Habubu, will be entering the Bigg Boss house as one of the 17 contestants, marking the first time a non-human has joined the reality franchise. This surprising move has sparked global curiosity, especially across the UAE where Habubu has already become a viral phenomenon.Habubu is not your average robot. Designed as an interactive AI doll, she’s built with state-of-the-art conversational intelligence, emotional recognition, and basic domestic functionality. According to IFCM, the UAE-based company behind her, Habubu can speak up to seven languages, including Hindi, which gives her an edge in a show like Bigg Boss that thrives on communication and drama.What truly sets Habubu apart is her appearance and charm. With large expressive eyes, a warm and engaging personality, and dressed in traditional Arabic attire, she has captured attention across social media platforms. Her growing fan base in the Gulf sees her as more than just a tech novelty, she's being celebrated as a cultural bridge between the Arab world and mainstream South Asian entertainment.Notably, IFCM, which also managed former Bigg Boss contestant Abdu Rozik, is handling Habubu’s participation.This strategic backing adds credibility to the reports and indicates the move is well-planned, not a publicity stunt.Bigg Boss, hosted once again by Salman Khan , is known for reinventing itself each season. But Season 19’s theme, reportedly titled ""Rewind"", suggests a nostalgic return to classic rules, legendary tasks, and dramatic moments from past editions. Within this context, the inclusion of an AI contestant like Habubu stands out as both retro and futuristic, a combination sure to intrigue audiences.As reported by Siasat, Habubu is expected to be specially reprogrammed for the show to ensure a balanced dynamic among the 17 expected contestants, 16 human and one AI. This means she will not overshadow her co-contestants but instead enhance the show's entertainment quotient in unique ways. Her multilingual abilities and AI-driven emotional responses could make her a central figure in house dynamics.For UAE residents and tech enthusiasts, Habubu’s participation is more than just reality TV news, it’s a significant cultural moment. It showcases homegrown innovation on one of the biggest entertainment platforms in South Asia, watched by millions across India, the Middle East, and beyond.Her entry into Bigg Boss also aligns with the UAE’s vision to be a global leader in AI and smart technologies. With Dubai and Abu Dhabi already hosting several robotics and AI expos annually, Habubu’s rise reflects how far the nation has come in integrating tech with everyday life and now, with global pop culture.As interest surges, fans in the UAE are keenly watching how this historic experiment unfolds. Will Habubu win hearts or even the trophy? One thing’s certain: this season of Bigg Boss is set to spark conversations far beyond the walls of the house.","Habubu is an interactive AI doll with state-of-the-art conversational intelligence, emotional recognition, and basic domestic functionality.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

The announcement follows intense criticism over Parekh’s moonlighting, which he attributed to financial hardships. In his first public comments since the scandal broke, Parekh told TBPN, a U.S. technology show, “I’m not proud of what I did.” He admitted to juggling jobs at five companies but denied employing junior developers to manage the workload, emphasizing, “I wish I had the money.” Parekh also clarified that he began taking multiple jobs in 2022, “before the CoPilot boom,” and did not rely on AI tools to handle his tasks.The controversy erupted when Playground AI founder Suhail Doshi exposed Parekh on X, warning, “There’s a guy named Soham Parekh (in India) who works at 3-4 startups at the same time. He’s been preying on YC companies and more. Beware.” The post, referencing startup accelerator Y Combinator, led to swift consequences: Parekh was fired from multiple roles, and recruiters flagged him as a risky hire.Despite the backlash, Parekh has found a new opportunity with Darwin Studios, where he will help build Wayve, an AI-powered video remixing platform. Sanjit Juneja, the startup’s founder, praised Parekh as a “10x engineer” with “something even greater to prove than just his love for software.”The scandal has reignited debates in tech circles about the ethics of moonlighting and the pressures of startup culture. Critics have labeled Parekh’s actions fraudulent, while others argue the incident exposes deeper issues in the industry’s demand for relentless productivity and the lack of oversight in remote work.

OnePlus Nord 5 and OnePlus Nord CE 5: Unboxing and first look

Soham Parekh , the Indian software engineer who has been accused of simultaneously working for multiple American startups, has reportedly reached out to the very Silicon Valley CEO who exposed him, asking for a ‘career advice’. Parekh has allegedly been deceiving employers about his availability and commitments, triggering a social media debate on remote hiring practices.“Have I completely sabotaged my career?”, Parekh asked as per tech entrepreneur Suhail Doshi, who exposed the controversy, dubbed “Soham-gate”. Here’s Doshi’s full post on X:The saga began when Doshi posted on X, alleging Parekh of simultaneously working for numerous American tech companies while misleading them about his commitments. Doshi, co-founder of Mixpanel and founder of Playground AI, publicly accused Parekh of ""preying on YC companies and more"" by holding simultaneous employment at three to four startups.Doshi revealed he fired Parekh in his first week a year ago for similar deception, noting, ""He hasn't stopped... No more excuses.""Following Doshi's initial accusation, a flood of similar experiences emerged from other startup founders. Flo Crivello, CEO of Lindy, immediately fired Parekh upon learning the news, noting his impressive interview performance.Nicolai Ouporov of Fleet AI confirmed Parekh's multi-year pattern of working for ""more than 4 startups at any given time.""Documentation shared by Doshi, purportedly Parekh's resume, listed employment at prominent AI companies including Dynamo AI, Union AI, Synthesia, and Alan AI. However, Doshi dismissed the credentials as “probably 90% fake,” noting many listed links were now defunct.The resume presented an impressive profile: a software engineer with degrees from the University of Mumbai and the Georgia Institute of Technology, boasting experience across multiple high-profile AI startups.","Soham Parekh, the Indian software engineer who has been accused of simultaneously working for multiple American startups, has reportedly reached out to the very Silicon Valley CEO who exposed him. “Asking this as genuine advice since I do really love what I do, have I completely sabotaged my career?
