How the false donation story spread and why it’s suspicious

What actually happened in the Charlie Kirk case

In the wake of the tragic shooting of Charlie Kirk, co-founder of Turning Point USA, false rumors began circulating online that several high-profile NFL players had donated large sums to his family. Social media posts claimed stars such as Jalen Hurts, Josh Allen , Aaron Rodgers, Travis Kelce , Nick Bosa, Malik Nabers, and Jordan Love each contributed $300,000 to support Kirk’s family. However, a thorough fact check reveals these reports are completely fabricated.The rumor first appeared across multiple unofficial websites and Facebook pages, many of which seemed designed to attract engagement rather than provide credible information. Lead Stories, a respected fact-checking organization, investigated the claims and flagged major red flags indicating fabrication.The fact-checkers pointed out that, “No Verifiable Sources, Anonymous Sources, Manufactured Quotes, Suspicious Financial Details, Missing Context, No Media Coverage, and Vague Future Claims.”Lead Stories highlighted that the article followed “the classic pattern of emotional manipulation, manufactured quotes, specific but unverifiable details, and no legitimate media corroboration.”Alarmingly, the fake stories were reportedly published from Vietnam, targeting an American audience while masquerading as credible news.Claude.ai, an AI-powered verification tool, also flagged the content as likely fabricated, further discrediting the viral narrative. The fact-check concluded that these stories were not grounded in fact but appeared designed to exploit a tragedy for social media traction.Charlie Kirk was shot during a Q&A session at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. The 22-year-old suspect, Tyler Robinson, was arrested the following night and is expected to be formally charged soon. While the tragedy has deeply shocked many, there is no public or verified evidence indicating NFL players made any monetary donations to Kirk’s family.Also Read: Controversy deepens as NFL permits teams to decide on honoring Charlie Kirk following assassination This incident underscores the importance of verifying information before spreading emotionally charged stories, especially involving high-profile tragedies.", false rumors began circulating online that several high-profile NFL players had donated large sums to his family.

Tips for creating high-quality AI Avatars

Be specific in your prompt: Include every relevant detail for the best results. Clear descriptions minimise errors and help the AI generate avatars that closely match your intended vision.

Experiment with styles: Try cartoon, anime, and realistic options to see which fits your vision. Exploring multiple styles allows you to discover unique looks that may better suit different platforms or purposes.

Combine methods: If available, use facial or pose editors after generation for extra customisation. Layering tools ensures greater precision, letting you fine-tune small details like expressions, gestures, or accessories.

Keep track of prompts: Save successful prompts for future avatar creations. Building a personal prompt library saves time, improves consistency, and makes it easier to recreate or refine specific designs later.

5 Key things you missed at Apple iPhone launch event





Following the tragic shooting of President Donald Trump aide Charlie Kirk at a rally in Utah, graphic videos of the incident quickly went viral across major social media platforms, sparking renewed scrutiny over content moderation policies. According to a report by The New York Times, within minutes of the shooting on Wednesday (September 10), videos were posted on Elon Musk 's X and were viewed over 11 million times within two hours. The graphic footage also spread to Meta-owned platforms like Instagram and Threads, as well as YouTube and Telegram, accumulating millions of views.The viral spread of the video has forced major platforms to respond, with varying approaches. Musk-owned X’s official policy prohibits “excessively gory” content but allows it to be posted with a warning label.The company posted online that it “will continue to stand against violence and censorship, ensuring this platform amplifies truth and open dialogue for everyone.”Meanwhile, Musk, who appeared to have seen some of the videos, said in a post, “The shot looked real bad, but I sure hope Charlie makes it somehow.”Google-owned YouTube said that the platform is removing some graphic content and applying age restrictions to other videos to prevent them from being seen by users under 18.“Our hearts are with Charlie Kirk’s family following his tragic death. We are closely monitoring our platform and prominently elevating news content on the homepage, in search and in recommendations to help people stay informed,” the spokesman was quoted as saying.Meta – the parent company of Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and Threads – declined to comment but some clips on its platforms were found to have been marked as sensitive, while others were not, the report said.Experts say this event continues a long-standing and troubling trend, adding that the proliferation of violent content has become a grim fixture of the internet.“This is the first time such a widely recognised figure has been murdered in such a public way and spread this way on social media,” said Emerson Brooking, director of strategy at the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council.","Graphic videos of the incident quickly went viral across major social media platforms, sparking renewed scrutiny over content moderation policies.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has told employees that the company needs to “do better” in rebuilding trust with its workforce. The remarks come after months of layoffs and a new return-to-office rule that the company announced recently. When an employee asked Nadella to speak about a perceived lack of empathy in the company’s culture, the Microsoft CEO said “I deeply appreciate that, the question and the sentiment behind it,” as per an audio obtained by CNBC. “I take it as feedback for me and everyone in the leadership team, because at the end of the day, I think we can do better, and we will do better.""According to audio obtained by CNBC, HR chief Amy Coleman acknowledged mixed reactions to the return-to-office mandate during the session. Some employees fear a loss of autonomy, though data shows staff around Seattle already average 2.4 days in the office each week.Nadella acknowledged that remote work can make mentorship harder for new employees and interns. “Management is just mostly all remote, but the interns are all, you know, in one location. And so those are things that just will break a social contract,” he said.Still, Satya Nadella cautioned staff about long-term challenges. “Some of the biggest businesses we built may not be as relevant going forward,” he warned. “Some of the margin that we love today may not be there tomorrow, and that means you have to be way ahead of all of those going away, right?”“We have some very, very hard work ahead of us and that hard process of renewal is essentially what we have to do,” Nadella said.“You have to be hardcore in terms of an intellectual honesty about what really needs to happen.”The meeting also touched on fallout from a Guardian report alleging that Israel’s military used Microsoft’s Azure cloud to store Palestinians’ phone calls during the Gaza conflict. Microsoft has since fired five employees who protested against the company’s involvement.President Brad Smith addressed the issue, saying Microsoft will support Jewish employees who have faced harassment. “We don’t get to control what happens outside Microsoft, but we need to be clear about one thing,” Smith said.“There is no room for antisemitism at Microsoft, and as a company and as a community, we will protect this group and defend them from that,” the executive added.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told employees that the company needs to ""do better"" in rebuilding trust with its workforce.

China’s massive military parade on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of its victory against Japan in WWII showcased cutting-edge military hardware that has got global defence experts talking. Here’s a look at the platforms that highlight China’s rapid military modernisation and present a clear challenge to US military superpower status.China has clearly learned from the Russia-Ukraine war and is going full throttle with AI drones that can not only wear down the enemy but also assist its own forces in real time according to battlefield conditions. Two platforms stood out: AJX002 giant submarine drone and GJ-11. The former is an extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle that can carry out reconnaissance missions, while the latter is a stealth attack drone that can fly alongside conventional fighter jets and aid them in their missions.Displayed publicly for the first time, the LY-1 is an armoured truck mounted laser weapon that can supposedly burn or disable the electronics of enemy aircraft, drones and other vehicles.A sea version of the platform was on display too. The system is ideal to tackle drone swarms and far more economical than kinetic projectile systems.The impressive array of missiles on display during the parade included a new version of Dongfeng-5 nuclear capable ICBM that can carry up to 12 warheads, can be launched from second-strike underground facilities, and has a range of 12,400 miles, bringing all of continental US within its strike reach. On the other hand, DF-61 ICBM can be fired from mobile launchers, while Dongfeng 26-D intermediate range missile has been dubbed as ‘Guam Killer’ referencing its ability to potentially target US military bases on the Pacific island territory.The quadruped robots can walk alongside soldiers or undertake missions on their own such as clearing mines, reconnaissance or hunting enemy troops. The platform is part of China’s plans to build a futuristic army, and could perhaps eventually evolve to humanoid robotic soldiers.PLA also displayed all types of its fifth-generation fighter aircraft on active duty for the first time. These included the J-20, J-20A, J-20S, J-35A, and J-35. J-20S is the world’s first twin-seat stealth jet, while J-35 is the first radar-dodging combat plane in Chinese navy. All of these are intended to show China’s growing air power capabilities.",China showcased cutting-edge military hardware that has got global defence experts talking.

Why authorities are so strict, the risk of tampering

Microchips



Holograms

Travellers flying from the UAE are being warned: even a slightly worn passport can now stop you from boarding. As immigration and airline checks tighten, minor wear and tear, such as frayed edges, water stains, or a scratched chip, is enough to get a valid passport rejected, regardless of visa status. Travelers are strongly encouraged to check their passports thoroughly before arriving at the airport to prevent unexpected issues and travel delays.International travellers departing from Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Sharjah are facing increased scrutiny over the physical condition of their passports. UAE-based airlines are now enforcing stricter rules, often stopping passengers at check-in if their passports show even minor damage, regardless of visa validity or passport expiry date.Common types of damage that can raise red flags include:Authorities say these issues, though sometimes minor, may compromise embedded security features such as microchips, holograms, and machine-readable zones. If these features are damaged, passport scanners may fail, leading to suspicion of forgery or tampering by immigration officers.Airlines departing from the UAE are also held accountable. If a passenger is denied entry due to passport condition, the airline may face penalties or be required to bear the cost of deportation.This has made airlines extra cautious at the check-in stage, often barring travellers with visibly damaged passports from boarding at all.While the UAE is leading this push for pristine passports, other countries are also enforcing similar measures. The following nations are particularly strict about the condition of travel documents:Officials generally split passport damage into two categories:Even a partially damaged passport can lead to denial of boarding or entry. Travellers are strongly advised to renew their passport at the first signs of wear, before problems occur. Prevention is key: keeping the document dry, using a protective cover, and avoiding inserting papers or folding the passport helps maintain its integrity.Modern passports are more than just identification; they are high-security documents embedded with:Damage to any of these features can cause technical issues at automated border control gates or manual inspection points. A passport that fails to scan correctly could appear tampered with, triggering suspicion and potential detainment.Officials emphasize that the strict enforcement is to protect national security and maintain document integrity. With the rise in identity fraud and document forgery, immigration systems are designed to flag any inconsistencies, no matter how small.","Even a tiny tear or water stain on your passport can lead UAE airlines and immigration to refuse boarding, despite a valid visa.

Whether you're moving to the UAE to advance your career, begin university, or apply for long-term residency like the Golden Visa, one document is key to unlocking your future: the Certificate of Equivalency. Issued by the UAE Ministry of Education, this official document confirms that your foreign academic qualifications match the country's educational standards. Without it, opportunities can be delayed or even denied. Here’s everything you need to know who needs it, why it matters, and how to get it.A Certificate of Equivalency, also known as a Certificate of Recognition, is a formal document issued by the UAE Ministry of Education (MoE) to verify that a degree earned outside the UAE is equivalent to the country’s academic benchmarks.This certificate proves that:You must obtain an Equivalency Certificate if you're:Even if you have years of experience or hold senior roles, your degree needs to be recognized locally before you can legally practice, study, or be employed in many sectors in the UAE.As of November 1, 2024, all certificate equivalency services in the UAE are now handled by the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MoHESR).

"Ramadan in UAE: Essential rules, etiquette, and legal guidelines every expat should know",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/ramadan-in-uae-essential-rules-etiquette-and-legal-guidelines-every-expat-should-know/articleshow/123866301.cms,"During Ramadan in the UAE, expats must avoid eating, smoking, and wear modest clothing in public/Representative Image

Public behavior and legal restrictions during fasting hours

From sunrise to sunset, it is not permitted to eat, drink, smoke, or chew gum in any public area — including streets, cars, malls, cinemas, and workplaces.

This applies to everyone, including non-Muslims, and includes even when you are inside a vehicle.

Federal Law No. 3 of 1987, amended in 2006, clearly addresses this under Article 313: Anyone caught eating, drinking, or smoking in public during fasting hours may face up to one month in jail or be fined AED 2,000.

Eating or drinking is only allowed in private spaces, such as your home, hotel room, or private office cabin.

The law and social norms are aligned in promoting respect for the fasting public, so even non-Muslims are expected to comply fully during daylight hours.



Dress, music, and public decorum during ramadan

Clothing should be modest and non-revealing throughout the month, especially in public places like restaurants, malls, and events.

Wearing tight or revealing outfits is strongly discouraged, even when attending dinners or nightlife venues.

Playing loud music — whether in your car, at home, or on the beach — should be avoided. Listening to music privately is allowed, but make sure it cannot be heard outside. On the beach or in shared spaces, use headphones to avoid disturbing others.

These practices reflect the general expectation of modesty and quiet reflection during Ramadan.



Navigating work, traffic, and meal timings during ramadan

Working hours across the UAE are shortened during Ramadan, with many offices closing earlier than usual.

This also impacts traffic patterns, with peak congestion often occurring: In the morning (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM) In the afternoon (1:00 PM to 3:00 PM)

Roads become especially busy before Iftar (sunset), as people hurry home to break their fast.

Avoid driving close to sunset if possible, as roads can be chaotic and hazardous at that time.

Adapting your schedule to these changes helps ensure respect and convenience during Ramadan

Restaurants tend to be very crowded after sunset, when families and groups gather for Iftar.

Make reservations in advance to secure a spot for dinner during this time.



Community engagement, charity, and social conduct

It is appropriate and appreciated to greet people with phrases like “Ramadan Kareem” or “Ramadan Mubarak” during the month.

Charity is a central value of Ramadan. Residents and visitors are encouraged to: Contribute to humanitarian programs Support local and international charities Make small gestures of kindness toward the less fortunate

The month is also a time to engage in community and cultural exchanges.

Whether Muslim or non-Muslim, everyone is encouraged to reflect on values such as tolerance, compassion, and gratitude.

Interacting respectfully with neighbors, friends, and colleagues is part of embracing the spirit of the month.





During the holy month of Ramadan, daily life in the UAE undergoes a noticeable shift. This period is marked by fasting, prayer, and reflection for Muslims — but also brings important cultural and legal expectations for non-Muslim residents and tourists. Whether you’re living in the Emirates or visiting during Ramadan, knowing how to respectfully navigate public behavior, work routines, and social interactions is essential. Here’s a complete guide to what’s expected.","From sunrise to sunset, it is not permitted to eat, drink, smoke, or chew gum in any public area. This applies to everyone, including non-Muslims, and includes even when you are inside a vehicle. Anyone caught eating, drinking, or smoking in public during fasting hours may face up to one month in jail.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123866372,imgsize-1402926,width-400,resizemode-4/ramadan-rules-for-expats.jpg"

In a major push to modernise citizen services and reduce red tape, the UAE government has rolled out a streamlined process for renewing and replacing Emirates ID cards. Under the updated system, UAE citizens can now complete the entire procedure in a single step, with the card’s validity automatically determined based on age—mirroring the process used for Emirati passports.As part of the second cycle of the Zero Bureaucracy Programme, the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has overhauled the Emirates ID services for citizens. The key change simplifies what was once a multi-step procedure into a single-step process—now limited to submitting the application and paying the service fee.This major shift is intended to eliminate bureaucratic friction, enhance the customer experience, and align with the UAE’s wider goal of delivering efficient, digital-first government services. The ICP highlighted that this move is consistent with its broader strategy to modernise smart services, shorten service journeys, and meet the public’s expectations for convenience and accessibility.A central feature of the revamped system is the automatic determination of the Emirates ID validity period, a model borrowed from the country’s passport service. The validity is assigned as follows:This applies when the service requested is renewal.In the case of replacement, the new ID card will be issued with the same validity period remaining on the existing card. Applicants cannot alter or extend the validity duration manually in any scenario.The Emirates ID application form has also undergone a redesign in the smart services system, available via the ICP’s official website and mobile application. Notable improvements include:These changes help citizens complete the process more quickly, while reducing the possibility of errors or duplication.The updated services for both Emirates ID renewal and replacement are already live and accessible through the ICP’s online platforms. Citizens can now complete the full process through the website or smart app, without needing to navigate multiple steps or submit duplicate information.This transition marks another milestone in the UAE's commitment to digitally transform public services, enhance operational efficiency, and reinforce its reputation for excellence in governance and service delivery.UAE citizens can now renew or replace their Emirates ID through a simplified process that involves just one step.

A video of Indian devotees performing Ganesh Visarjan in a river in the United Kingdom has gone viral on social media as video sparked both admiration and criticism on online.The visuals show a group of devotees in traditional attire carrying a Ganesh idol on a boat and immersing it in the river, which was on Instagram by user @sandeep_anthwal. The immersion of the Ganesh idol was carried out vibrantly on the beats of the dhol in a ritualistic manner.Ganesh Visarjan, which marks the culmination of the ten-day Ganesh Utsav, is observed across India with grand processions and massive public gatherings.While many users hailed the viral video as a heartwarming display of culture abroad, others raised concerns over the environmental impact of immersing idols in natural water bodies.“This is such a beautiful display of tradition, it feels like home away from home,” one user commented. Another countered, “Why are people polluting rivers abroad in the name of tradition?”Some viewers were captivated by the presence of swans in the frame. “Watching the swans swim so close to the idol is magical,” commented another.Ganesh Utsav, celebrated widely across India, involves bringing home idols of Lord Ganesh, worshipping them for ten days, and immersing them in rivers, lakes or seas on the final day. In recent years, several Indian states have encouraged the use of eco-friendly idols and artificial immersion tanks to minimise harm to the environment.The UK video, however, has opened up a fresh debate on how such traditions are carried out overseas, with the diaspora community striving to preserve cultural practices while facing scrutiny over their ecological impact.",Ganesh Visarjan marks the culmination of the ten-day Ganesh Utsav.

Camilla BREAKS Royal Code In Public, And King Charles’s Next Move Was TELLING | WATCH

Power and the Palace





Queen Camilla's bravery is no longer a secret as a new book, Power and the Palace by Valentine Low, revealed that as a teenager, she once fought off a sexual assault on a train to London’s Paddington by striking her attacker with the heel of her shoe before having him arrested.The book, currently being serialised in, recalls a 2008 exchange between Camilla and then-London Mayor Boris Johnson, PTI reported.At the time, Camilla Shand, aged 16 or 17, reportedly struck back at a man who was inappropriately touching her by removing her shoe and hitting him with the heel.“I did what my mother taught me to. I took off my shoe and whacked him in the nuts with the heel,” reads the account from the book.Once the train reached Paddington, she alerted a police officer and had the assailant arrested.“The relevance of this conversation was that Johnson at the time wanted to open three rape crisis centres. There was already one in south London, and he wanted to open ones in east, west and north London,” the author notes, adding that Camilla went on to inaugurate some of these new centres.""She did the responsible thing. Not only was she resourceful and strong, she was a responsible citizen in making sure the man was arrested,"" the book's author told the BBC.As patron of the domestic abuse charity SafeLives, the 78-year-old Queen regularly visits refuges and crisis centres in the UK and abroad. She has spoken strongly about recognising the resilience of women who face domestic abuse and why they should not feel shame in speaking out, as per PTI.In a 2020 speech, she remarked: “Through my work, I have talked to many women who have lived with coercive control and domestic violence and, thankfully, come out at the other end as the victors, not the victims. They are some of the bravest people I have ever met. Their stories are harrowing and have reduced even the toughest of their listeners to tears. That is why it is so vital that these survivors should no longer feel any shame or any blame. ""Valentine Low’s, based on nearly 100 interviews with senior politicians, officials, aides and experts, is set for release next week, promising rare insight into the often secretive relationship between the monarchy and government.","Camilla Shand, aged 16 or 17, reportedly struck back at a man who was inappropriately touching her by removing her shoe and hitting him with the heel.

Expert Drops Bombshell





The 30th anniversary of Princess Diana’s death may reignite one of the monarchy’s most bitter rivalries. According to royal expert Tom Sykes, Prince William and Prince Harry could be planning competing documentaries on their late mother—threatening to turn her legacy into their latest battleground.Speaking on The Daily Beast podcast, Sykes revealed that he’s heard “on good authority” that the brothers, who have not spoken in years, are exploring separate projects to commemorate Diana in 2027. William is reportedly “not remotely amused” by whispers that Harry and Meghan Markle are working on a Netflix feature tied to their Archewell deal—especially after previous projects were panned as “boring” and “disastrous. ”“We could have dueling Diana documentaries from the two boys,” Sykes suggested, noting how such films could cement their clashing narratives about the princess’s life and the events surrounding her 1997 death.The timing comes as Sykes himself stirs controversy with a fresh essay revisiting conspiracy theories about Diana’s fatal Paris car crash, raising questions about whether her death was as straightforward as official inquiries concluded.While he stops short of calling for the case to be reopened, Sykes insists “the holes in the story are just so fascinating, it’s all hidden in plain sight.”Diana was killed on August 31, 1997, when a Mercedes driven by Henri Paul crashed in a Paris underpass. Paul and Diana’s companion, Dodi Fayed, also died. An official investigation blamed speed and Paul’s intoxication, but speculation about foul play has never fully disappeared.Now, as the brothers approach this milestone anniversary on opposite sides of the Atlantic, Diana’s memory risks becoming collateral damage in their fractured relationship.","The 30th anniversary of Princess Diana's death may reignite one of the monarchy's most bitter rivalries.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Google’s latest AI tool, Nano Banana, has taken social media by storm, with millions of users experimenting with toy-like 3D figurines of themselves, friends, and even celebrities. For those unaware, Google announced Nano Banana in August this year. The model is the nickname for Gemini 2.5 Flash Image and can be used to instantly transform any photo into a lifelike 3D figure, capturing everything from facial expressions and clothing to background textures with striking detail. While the results can be stunning, many first-time users may face challenges. Here are some practical tips for non-experts to get the best out of Google’s Nano Banana.Instead of typing just “my photo as a superhero,” add details such as “in a futuristic city, wearing a metallic suit, cinematic lighting.” The more context you provide, the more accurately Nano Banana generates your image.Uploading a clean, well-lit photo of yourself or your subject helps the AI lock on to facial features. Avoid blurry or cluttered photos, as the tool can pick up unwanted details.Nano Banana handles different styles — from playful toy figurines to anime or retro looks.Try phrases like “in Pixar style,” “in Japanese woodblock art style,” or “as a 90s action figure” to see which fits best.Adding verbs such as “standing with folded arms,” or “holding a surfboard” can make results more dynamic and prevent awkward poses.Don’t settle for the first attempt. Running the same prompt a few times can give very different outcomes. Small tweaks — like adding “bright background” or “soft shadows” — can fix flaws quickly.For millions diving into the Nano Banana craze, these small adjustments can turn clumsy AI renders into share-worthy creations. As one user joked online: “It’s like teaching a banana to sculpt — patience and the right words make all the difference.”Here’s a simple step-by-step guide:","Google’s latest AI tool, Nano Banana, has taken social media by storm, with millions of users experimenting with toy-like 3D figurines of themselves, friends, and even celebrities.
