GURGAON: A wedding video of popular Haryana-based automobile YouTuber Arun Panwar has triggered a heated debate on dowry and social responsibility after visuals surfaced showing large amounts of cash and gold being presented during wedding rituals, even as the gifts were described as “daan” (donation) and not dowry.Panwar, a resident of Gurugram and originally from Indri village in Sohna, is going to get married to Dr Tithi. Wedding ceremonies held on January 30 sparked criticism.In a reel uploaded on Panwar’s Instagram account, a person is seen reading out a detailed list of items allegedly given as “daan”. The narration mentions, “Ladke ki chain saade paanch tole ki,” followed by a list that includes a 4 tola bracelet, two gold rings for engagement and marriage, jewellery for the groom’s father, uncle, brothers, mother, sister-in-law and the bride’s sister. The video further claims that a total of 21 tolas of gold and Rs 71 lakh in cash were given.The video quickly went viral, drawing sharp criticism from social media users who questioned whether influencers were normalising dowry under the guise of tradition. “Are influencers now promoting dowry?” one user asked. Another commented, “We live in a society where all of this is applauded. No wonder we’re so doomed.” Some users even questioned why no legal action had been taken if such practices were being displayed publicly.A particularly pointed comment noted that the bride is a highly educated doctor, saying it was disturbing that such practices continued even when the woman involved is professionally accomplished.Arun Panwar began his YouTube career in 2019 and is known for automobile-related content such as car reviews, mileage tests, feature breakdowns and ownership experiences.He holds a BCA degree and has built a strong digital presence, with over 2.4 million subscribers on YouTube and around one million followers on Instagram.A car enthusiast, Panwar owns several premium vehicles, including a Kia Seltos, Ford Endeavour, Toyota Fortuner and Mahindra Thar.The viral wedding video has once again brought the issue of dowry into focus, raising questions about the role of social media influencers and whether rebranding such exchanges as “gifts” or “donations” can obscure practices that are legally prohibited and socially contested.","Haryana-based automobile YouTuber Arun Panwar has triggered a heated debate on dowry and social responsibility.

Gallery with café? Artist Daniel Arsham opens new art-driven coffee and dessert restaurant in Dubai Mall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/gallery-with-caf-artist-daniel-arsham-opens-new-art-driven-coffee-and-dessert-restaurant-in-dubai-mall/articleshow/127899993.cms,"Daniel's Room Dubai Mall: Art, Coffee and Desserts Fusion in Fashion Avenue

What is Daniel’s Room? More than a café in Dubai Mall



Strategic location of Daniel Arsham's cafe and its cultural relevance







Dubai’s culinary and cultural landscape just got a bold new addition with the launch of Daniel’s Room at Dubai Mall’s Fashion Avenue, a space where specialty coffee, limited-edition desserts and contemporary art coexist under one roof. The concept, created by artist Daniel Arsham, has quickly emerged as one of the most talked-about openings in the city’s dynamic food and lifestyle scene.Unlike traditional restaurants or dessert spots, Daniel’s Room is designed as an immersive art-and-cuisine environment where every element, from the furniture and lighting to tableware and pastries, reflects the distinctive creative language of Daniel Arsham, the contemporary artist behind the space. Arsham’s work, known for its exploration of time, erosion and imagined futures, has been integrated into the design of the café itself.The interiors merge sculptural forms and tactile materials to create a setting that feels more like a gallery or architectural installation than a conventional restaurant. This artistic philosophy extends to the menu, which features specialty coffee, pastries, cakes and light bites that have been developed and tested over months to match the same thoughtful, tactile ethos as the space’s design.Part of what makes Daniel’s Room stand out is its hybrid identity of being simultaneously a café, a cultural destination and an art installation. The space includes limited-edition books, collectible objects and custom-designed tableware created exclusively for the venue, not available in galleries or online elsewhere.Unlike typical retail in a shopping mall setting, these collectibles are integrated into the café experience rather than dominating it and encourage visitors to sit, explore the details and return for both the ambience and the edible offerings. Daniel’s Room has been described as a place to “live in, not just visit,” where patrons are encouraged to settle in, enjoy their coffee, peruse art books and absorb the carefully curated aesthetic.Located on Level 2 of Fashion Avenue in one of the world’s busiest retail destinations, Daniel’s Room benefits from high footfall while offering visitors a unique cultural and culinary break from mainstream dining spots in Dubai Mall. Dubai has long become a global hub for innovative culinary concepts and experiential dining, from themed fine-dining restaurants to cafés that elevate coffee culture to an art form and Daniel’s Room fits squarely into this trend, offering something that is both visually compelling and gastronomically satisfying.Daniel’s Room reflects a broader cultural shift where art, lifestyle and daily experiences converge. Rather than confining art to museums or galleries, this concept brings artistic ingenuity into everyday rituals like having a cup of coffee or enjoying a dessert. This approach is not entirely new as iconic creative figures like Gordon Matta-Clark and Damien Hirst have explored restaurant concepts tied to their artistic vision but Daniel’s Room positions this tradition within a contemporary, globally recognised retail and lifestyle context.By integrating sculptural design with carefully considered food and beverage offerings, the space becomes a destination for both locals and tourists seeking more than just a meal; they are seeking an experience that stimulates multiple senses. Daniel’s Room is more than a new café, it represents a blurring of boundaries between food, art and design.By transforming a routine coffee stop into an immersive cultural experience, Daniel Arsham’s latest venture contributes to Dubai’s reputation as a global city where creativity, luxury and everyday life intersect. Whether you are there for the specialty coffee, limited-edition collectibles or simply to soak in the art-infused space, Daniel’s Room offers a fresh way to experience Dubai Mall, not just as a retail hub but as a destination for cultural discovery.","Daniel’s Room is an immersive art-and-cuisine environment where every element reflects the distinctive creative language of Daniel Arsham.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

In a stunning display that married adrenaline with architectural spectacle, five elite wingsuit athletes from XDubai recently executed a daring precision flight around Ciel Dubai Marina, which is now officially recognised as the world’s tallest hotel. The aerial stunt, part of the hotel’s grand opening celebrations, saw the team fly at speeds topping 200 km/h, including a jaw-dropping pass through a narrow architectural opening nicknamed the “eye of the needle.”This event did not just shatter expectations for extreme sports in the UAE, it spotlighted Dubai’s evolving strategy to fuse tourism, bold design and sky-high experiences into its global brand identity.At the heart of this spectacle is Ciel Dubai Marina, a landmark skyscraper rising to 377 metres, with 82 floors and 1,004 rooms and suites, now proudly holding the title of the world’s tallest hotel. The hotel’s dramatic architecture, complete with a glass-clad “Eye of the Needle” feature in its structure, served as the stage for the wingsuit team’s high-stakes flight.This distinctive design element, more typically admired from the ground, turned into a literal flight path for the athletes and a symbolic and literal integration of extreme sport with structural ingenuity.Ciel Dubai Marina’s opening and the choice of a wingsuit airshow reflects Dubai’s push to redefine mainstream hospitality by blending experience-driven tourism with record-breaking architecture.Wingsuit flying is one of the most technically demanding branches of sky sports, requiring intense control, aerodynamic precision and split-second decision-making. In this stunt, the lead flyer sliced through the tower’s narrow opening, an achievement that the team and onlookers dubbed the “eye of the needle” manoeuvre, at blistering speeds of over 200 km/h.The rest of the team maintained a tight formation around the hotel, their movements accentuated by coloured smoke trails that painted the sky above Dubai Marina. A custom FPV (first-person view) drone followed the team through their flight path, capturing cinematic footage from angles that no ground camera could match.Such stunts demand not only peak physical skill but also meticulous planning and coordination with team members rehearsing jumps and formations dozens of times to ensure safety and precision in execution.The wingsuit demonstration was more than a stunt; it acted as a global spectacle aligned with Dubai’s larger tourism ambitions. Dubai has consistently sought to intertwine extreme experiences with its luxurious hospitality offerings, from world-record attractions to architectural marvels. The combination of Ciel Dubai Marina’s grand opening and the wingsuit flight drew attention not just from local observers but from aviation, tourism and adventure enthusiasts worldwide.This aerial show also aligns with a rising trend of place-branding through experiential events, where cities leverage extraordinary activations (like skydives, wingsuit flights and other high-adrenaline displays) to signal innovation, modernity and fearless ambition to global audiences. Dubai’s use of extreme sports as part of its tourism and identity playbook is well-established. Organisations like XDubai have been behind several high-visibility events that combine thrill with destination marketing, including BASE jumps, wing suits and other aerial feats that often involve the city’s tallest structures or unique landscapes.The Ciel Dubai Marina flight expands this strategy into a new chapter, one where luxury hospitality openings are given experience-driven spectacles that both celebrate architectural achievement and propel media coverage worldwide. For the global tourism industry, such demonstrations serve a dual purpose: they position destinations as adventure-ready and forward-thinking and they create social media moments that amplify reach far beyond traditional travel marketing campaigns.The flight underscores several broader trends of blending extreme sports with destination launches, creating high-visibility spectacles rather than static ribbon-cuttings, architectural landmarks as arenas for experience-based storytelling where buildings become stages for memorable moments and Dubai’s strategic tourism diversification by combining luxury hospitality, adventure experiences and record-breaking design into its global brand.As cities around the world compete for attention in a crowded tourism landscape, activities like the XDubai wingsuit flight around Ciel Dubai Marina demonstrate how bold experiences can become powerful currency in the attention economy, attracting global eyes to local innovation. The recent wingsuit flight around and through Ciel Dubai Marina was more than a daring aerial stunt, it was a statement about Dubai’s evolving identity as a hub of experiential tourism and architectural excellence.By marrying extreme sports with the debut of the world’s tallest hotel, the event elevated a hospitality opening into a global conversation about taste, risk and spectacle. In doing so, it offered a compelling peek into how destinations of tomorrow might choose to tell their stories, not just with buildings but with bold, unforgettable moments in the sky.","Five elite XDubai wingsuit pros executed a daring precision flight around Ciel Dubai Marina.

Lucy Letby Netflix documentary: Why UK baby-killer nurse’s parents call it ‘invasion of privacy’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/lucy-letby-netflix-documentary-why-uk-baby-killer-nurses-parents-call-it-invasion-of-privacy-explained/articleshow/127847789.cms,"‘We will not watch it’: Parents condemn documentary

Use of family home footage sparks privacy concerns

Questions Raised Over Police Cooperation

Who Is Lucy Letby?





A new Netflix documentary on convicted British neonatal nurse Lucy Letby has sparked fresh controversy in the UK, with her parents accusing the streaming giant of a “complete invasion of privacy” for allegedly using footage of their family home without consent.The Investigation of Lucy Letby, set to stream from February 4 on Netflix, promises viewers “unseen footage and unheard insider accounts” from one of Britain’s most disturbing criminal cases.However, even before its release, the series has drawn criticism from Letby’s family, reopening debates around ethics, victimhood and privacy in true-crime storytelling.Lucy Letby’s parents, Susan and John Letby, have said they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.In a statement to The Guardian, the couple said previous media coverage, including televised images of their daughter being led away in handcuffs, had already been “heartbreaking,” but claimed the Netflix production crossed a new line.“This documentary is on another level,” they said. “We will not watch it. It would likely kill us if we did.”A major point of contention for the Letbys is the alleged inclusion of footage filmed inside or around their long-time family home, without their knowledge.The couple said they were unaware that the documentary would feature images of the house where they have lived for more than 40 years, located in a small town where, they say, “everyone knows everyone.”They also criticised a clip shown in the documentary’s trailer, which reportedly depicts Lucy Letby being arrested in her bedroom and saying goodbye to one of her cats.“All this taking place in the home where we have lived for decades,” they said, calling it “a complete invasion of privacy.”The parents further questioned why an investigating officer involved in the case was permitted to discuss or show what occurred inside their home on the day of Letby’s arrest.“We always cooperated fully,” they said, asking why Netflix and the production company did not inform them before using such material.Netflix and ITN Productions, which produced the documentary, have not publicly responded to these claims.Lucy Letby, born 4 January 1990, is a former neonatal nurse who worked at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England. She came under suspicion after an unusually high number of infant deaths occurred in the neonatal unit between June 2015 and June 2016.After a lengthy investigation, Letby was charged in November 2020 with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder involving newborn babies.In August 2023, she was convicted of seven counts of murder and seven counts of attempted murder.She received a whole-life prison sentence, meaning she will never be eligible for release. In July 2024, she was also found guilty in a retrial of an attempted murder charge on which the jury had previously failed to reach a verdict.Letby is currently incarcerated at HMP Low Newton in Durham.","Lucy Letby’s parents say they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.

Dubai authorities reveal two key locations for the futuristic Dubai Loop,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-authorities-reveal-two-key-locations-for-the-futuristic-dubai-loop/articleshow/127884538.cms,"Dubai launches the first phase of its futuristic Loop transport system / Image: AI

What is the Dubai Loop?

Key Locations

Faster, smoother travel beneath busy city streets

Integration with existing networks like Dubai Metro and buses

Reduced surface traffic congestion

Enhanced commuter experience with climate-controlled stations and modern vehicles

Alternate ""Active"" loop

What’s next?





Dubai is officially taking its ""transport of tomorrow"" beneath the surface. The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), in partnership with Elon Musk ’s The Boring Company, has identified the initial corridor for the revolutionary Dubai Loop.The first phase of this underground network will specifically target two of the most congested yet vital areas in the emirate. While the full 17km pilot phase will feature 11 stations, the ""anchor"" locations are set to connect Downtown Dubai and the Dubai Marina area.This strategic link aims to bridge the city's commercial core with its most popular residential and tourist seafront, effectively creating a ""wormhole"" that bypasses the daily gridlock of Sheikh Zayed Road.The Dubai Loop is an underground high-speed transport system developed in collaboration with The Boring Company, Elon Musk’s tunnel-building venture, and aims to dramatically cut travel times, ease congestion, and redefine urban mobility in Dubai. Officials say the system could evolve into a network capable of carrying 20,000 passengers per hour or more via high-speed electric vehicles moving through dedicated tunnels.Originally announced in 2025, the plan envisages an extensive network that spans several kilometres beneath the city’s busiest areas. The Loop will feature multiple underground stations integrated with existing transit systems, offering commuters fast, weather-protected travel while reducing traffic on surface roads.According to The Boring Company’s project overview, the initial network could eventually expand beyond its first phase to serve many more destinations, making it a cornerstone of Dubai’s long-term transportation transformation.RTA has indicated that construction will begin soon on the first phase, covering the section between Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) and Dubai Mall. These areas were chosen for early rollout because they are among Dubai’s most frequently travelled corridors, linking business districts with major retail, leisure and metro hubs.This section is expected to serve as a proof of concept for the larger network, allowing engineers and planners to refine operations, passenger handling and safety systems before extending the Loop to other high-traffic areas of the city.Once operational, the Loop is expected to offer:In parallel with the underground tunnels, a second ""Loop"" project led by Emirati firm URB is set to transform the city's surface. Known as THE LOOP, this is a 93km climate-controlled cycling and walking highway.This glass-enclosed structure will encircle the city, connecting over 3 million residents to key locations within a 20-minute walk or bike ride. Powered by kinetic flooring that generates electricity from your footsteps, this project aligns with the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan to make the city the most walkable and bike-friendly in the world.RTA officials, including Matar Al Tayer, have emphasised that the Dubai Loop’s first phase of work will begin imminently, though official operational dates are yet to be confirmed. Industry observers expect that initial segments could start test runs as early as 2026, with continued expansion in the years that follow.As the Loop takes shape, residents and commuters will get their first glimpse of how underground mass transit could complement Dubai’s world-class public transport system, from its iconic Metro to autonomous vehicles and high-speed rail.","Dubai's Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has identified the initial corridor for the revolutionary Dubai Loop.

Ramadan 2026 countdown





Across the seven Emirates, the call to prayer provides a moment of reflection amidst the country's fast-paced lifestyle. For Tuesday, February 3, 2026, the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments (AWQAF) has released the official timings.In the capital, Abu Dhabi, the day began with the Fajr prayer at 5:41 AM, while in Dubai, the Adhan was called slightly earlier at 5:37 AM. As the sun reaches its peak, Dhuhr provides a mid-day pause for workers and residents alike. Following these precise timings ensures that the community remains connected through shared discipline and devotion.In the UAE, the moments following the prayer are cherished for ""Dhikr"" (remembrance). The IACAD (Islamic Affairs & Charitable Activities Department) encourages worshippers to utilize the quiet time after the final Tasleem for personal supplication.One of the most powerful practices involves reciting ""Ayat al-Kursi,"" which is believed to offer divine protection. Many residents also follow the Sunnah of reciting ""SubhanAllah"" (33 times), ""Alhamdulillah"" (33 times), and ""Allahu Akbar"" (33 times).These small acts of mindfulness help maintain spiritual clarity during a busy workday, acting as a mental and emotional reset.The UAE is already preparing for the most blessed month of the year.

A Southern Chinese man extracts 191 grams of gold from scrapping SIM cards



Who is the man behind the process







On January 20 2026, a southern Chinese man's video surfaced online, who reportedly managed to extract 191 grams of gold from discarded SIMs. This triggered a further surge in demand for used SIM cards. The Chinese man commonly referred to as “Qiao” from Huizhou, Guangdong province, specialising in refining previous scrap metal, was reportedly behind the process.The extracted gold after filtering and heating reveals the worth, which is around 200,000 Yuan or approximately 27 lakhs. According to the South China Morning Post, this extraction may seem like a small DIY project, but it is far more complex than it seems in reality.The video went viral when Qiao poured stacks of used SIM cards into barrels of heat and corrosion. The scrap SIM card prices have reportedly shot up, and vendors are selling faster than they can stock. Some buyers say they want to mimic Qiao’s method.There’s fascination with the idea that you could pull gold from what looks like junk. But as Qiao warns, amateurs might be hurt, but one misstep could lead to chemical burns or worse.The modern SIM card typically contains less than 0.001 gram of gold, which means you would need approximately 400,000 cards to replicate Qiao’s recent results. What seems simple involves a complex process for extraction, which is termed Aqua Regia, that is, highly corrosive water. Experts warn: one mistake could lead to the release of lethal explosive gases.Qiao comes from Huizhou in Guangdong province. He’s a scrap metal refiner by trade. People online have dubbed him the “alchemist.” He reportedly told local media that the gold didn’t just come from SIM cards but with other discarded electronic chips helped make the total 191 grams.As reported, experts say it’s illegal in some regions to handle such chemicals without proper permits and is also dangerous. Qiao’s gold extraction might look like fun but it’s not a DIY hobby.","A Southern Chinese man extracts 191 grams of gold from scrapped SIM cards.

Meteor or space debris remains unclear

Growing volume of objects in Earth orbit

Differences in how light trails form





A bright streak of light briefly crossed the night sky above Wellington, New Zealand, on 30 January, catching the attention of residents and online viewers alike. The moment was captured by a fixed webcam at the Heretaunga Boating Club, where the light appeared reflected on the water below before fading from view. The footage circulated quickly after being shared online. According to reporting by the BBC, the source of the light has not been confirmed, though early assessments suggest it may have been a meteor or a piece of space debris re-entering Earth’s atmosphere. Events like this are not uncommon, but their suddenness and visibility often leave room for uncertainty, especially when they occur over populated areas and are recorded from multiple angles.The recording shows a sharp, luminous trail moving across the sky in a matter of seconds. It appears brighter than typical aircraft lights and lacks the blinking pattern usually associated with planes or helicopters. The reflection in the harbour adds to the impression of intensity, though the entire event is over almost as soon as it begins.Observers in and around Wellington reported seeing the light at roughly the same time.Some described it as a flash, others as a slow streak. No sound was reported, and there were no immediate reports of debris reaching the ground.The BBC noted that the light could have been caused by a meteor burning up as it entered the atmosphere. These natural objects are often no larger than a pebble, yet they can produce striking displays as friction heats them rapidly. Most disintegrate high above the Earth’s surface.Another possibility raised was space debris. In recent decades, the number of human-made objects in orbit has grown steadily. Old satellites, fragments from collisions, and discarded rocket parts sometimes fall back toward Earth, producing visual effects similar to meteors.According to the European Space Agency , more than sixty years of space activity have left a crowded orbital environment. Over 6,000 launches have placed tens of thousands of tracked objects into space. Of these, only a small proportion remain operational. The rest continue to circle the planet, gradually losing altitude.Together, this hardware represents thousands of tonnes of material. While most pieces burn up harmlessly on reentry, some survive longer than expected, depending on their size and composition.Meteors tend to move quickly and follow predictable paths based on their entry angle. Space debris, by contrast, can behave less consistently. Its shape, rotation, and material can all affect how it breaks apart, sometimes producing longer-lasting or uneven light trails.From the ground, these differences are not always easy to distinguish. A brief video clip, even a clear one, rarely provides enough information on its own.","A bright streak of light briefly crossed the night sky above Wellington, New Zealand, on 30 January.

Understanding paraselene: Russia observes rare ‘four moons’ spectacle



The science behind the eerie four-moon display







The city’s usual winter chill made eyes glued with folks whispering about the eerie glow, haunting yet almost surreal alignment of bright spots surrounding the real Moon. St. Petersburg, a city in Russia, viewed something unusual in the sky, which was reportedly addressed with ‘it wasn’t a glitch’ over social media platforms. A sky with ‘four Moons’ which viewers seemed lucky enough to look up and capture the moment with their phones.Sounds unreal, but it was a rare atmospheric phenomenon called a paraselene or ‘Mock Moon'.A paraselene, experts say, is caused by moonlight refracting through tiny ice crystals in the high cirrus clouds. The crystals are thin, plate-shaped, hexagonal, and floating far above the Earth. When the moonlight hits just right, it bends, creating bright spots on either side of the Moon. These are the “mock moons” or paraselenae.It seems like a simple trick of light, but it’s not. The angles have to be precise. NASA notes that these extra moons appear about 22 degrees or more away from the actual Moon. Usually, they are faint, especially compared to the bright lunar disk. So catching them requires good timing, clear skies, and a bit of luck.This particular display reportedly appeared because the ice crystals were wobbling slightly, giving the vertical extent of the paraselenae.Bigger crystals make taller mock moons. People watching the sky could see two on each side, creating the eerie impression of ‘four moons’ floating above the horizon.Photos showed ghostly images with the Moon at the centre and the two bright spots on either side, mirroring each other. “It looks like something out of a dream,” one observer reportedly wrote. Others commented that the sight was both beautiful and slightly unsettling. It’s the kind of rare occurrence that makes people stop in their tracks, even for a few moments.","St Petersburg, a city in Russia, viewed something unusual in the sky.

Archaeologists uncover tunnels inside 6000-year-old Neolithic site in Germany,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/archaeologists-uncover-tunnels-inside-6000-year-old-neolithic-site-in-germany/articleshow/127842566.cms,"Archaeologists uncover tunnels inside 6000-year-old Neolithic site in Germany (Image Source - Landesamt für Denkmalpflege und Archäologie Sachsen-Anhalt, Ulf Petzschmann)



Medieval tunnels found inside 6000-year-old Neolithic site in Germany

A landscape shaped by thousands of years of burial activity

A pit that did not behave like a grave

Erdstall tunnel points to medieval activity

Artefacts and animal remains inside the passage

Signs the tunnel entrance was deliberately sealed

Why a medieval tunnel was built inside a Neolithic grave site





Archaeologists in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt have uncovered an unusual underground tunnel inside a much older prehistoric burial site near the village of Reinstedt. The discovery was made during routine excavations carried out before the construction of wind turbines. The area was already known for its Neolithic and Bronze Age remains, but the tunnel came as an unexpected addition. At first, it appeared to be a simple pit in the soil. As digging continued, it became clear that the feature belonged to a much later period, likely the late Middle Ages. Its position inside an ancient burial landscape has drawn attention, raising quiet questions about how people in different eras reused places shaped long before their time. Mentioned in a press release Archaeologists working in Saxony-Anhalt have uncovered an unexpected underground structure inside a much older prehistoric burial site near the village of Reinstedt in the Harz district. The discovery was made during routine excavations carried out ahead of a planned wind energy project. What first appeared to be a simple feature in the soil slowly revealed something more complex, cutting across layers of history already known at the site.The location had long been recognised as archaeologically significant. A large trapezoid-shaped ditch from the Baalberg culture, dating to the fourth millennium BC, dominates the area. Nearby were traces of poorly preserved burials from the third millennium BC and remains that may belong to a Bronze Age burial mound dating to around the second millennium BC. The site had been used, reused, and reshaped over thousands of years.While examining the southern section of the Neolithic ditch, researchers noticed a long oval pit slicing across it at a near right angle. At first glance, it resembled a grave. But as excavation continued, the feature extended deeper into the loess soil without coming to an expected end. The fill contained late mediaeval pottery, loose stones, and small hollow spaces. The context no longer fit a burial.What emerged instead was an Erdstall, a narrow underground tunnel system dug by hand into firm soils. These structures are known from parts of central Europe and are usually dated to the late Middle Ages. Their purpose remains unclear. Some are thought to have served as hiding places, others as spaces with symbolic or ritual meaning.At Reinstedt, the tunnel curves gently toward the northwest. Inside, archaeologists found a horseshoe, the skeleton of a fox, and numerous bones from small animals. At the lowest level lay a thin layer of charcoal. The soil beneath showed no signs of prolonged heat, suggesting a short-lived fire rather than sustained use.The passage itself is cramped, barely a metre high in places and no wider than 70 centimetres. A stack of stones at the entrance may indicate it was deliberately sealed. A carved step and a small niche in the wall hint at careful planning rather than hurried digging.Why it was built here remains open. The prehistoric ditch may have still been visible in the medieval landscape, making the spot easy to locate. Or the ancient burial ground, possibly avoided by local people, may have offered the privacy needed for a hidden place. The tunnel keeps its silence.","Archaeologists in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt have uncovered an unusual underground tunnel inside a much older prehistoric burial site.

Once again, Elon Musk has taken the technological discourse to the next level, now integrating SpaceX and xAI as one corporate. It was a soft release in the form of an official release, but its news made an immediate ripple effect on social media, among investors, and throughout the tech community. Having been combined with an equally staggering valuation of $1.25 trillion, the move announced a radical gesture of an ever closer approach of integration between artificial intelligence, space exploration and digital communication.The interest of the public also increased when a YouTube sensation, MrBeast, joined the discussion with a sarcastic comment that also went viral. His reaction summarised the curiosity and disbelief people are having of the widening influence Musk is having on linked platforms, particularly as concerns remain as to how these ecosystems may intersect in the future.The announcement gained traction after Musk shared a celebratory message on X. “To the stars! @SpaceX& @xAI are now one company,” he wrote, amplifying an already historic update. Soon after, MrBeast reacted with a line that resonated widely with online users. “So I’m now posting on a SpaceX owned site? lol,” he posted.The humor masked a deeper debate. While the merger technically joins SpaceX with xAI, the artificial intelligence firm behind Grok, many users questioned how closely X itself could become tied into the structure.Some imagined Mars-based content. Others framed the move as a defining moment in human innovation, blending communication, intelligence, and off-planet capability.Musk addressed the purpose of the merger directly in a statement outlining its long-term vision. According to him, xAI joined SpaceX to ""Accelerate Humanity’s Future.”The statement continued, “SpaceX has acquired xAI to form the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform. This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI's mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars. ”Whether this vision reshapes industries or redraws boundaries, the merger has already achieved one thing.

Dubai’s ultra-modern Metro system is known for being fast, clean and efficient but breaking the rules can cost commuters from Dh100 to a hefty Dh2,000. As the city’s public transport usage surges, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has reinforced a comprehensive list of penalties aimed at ensuring safety, cleanliness and smooth operations across stations and trains.From fare evasion and smoking to tampering with emergency equipment, the penalties cover everything from minor etiquette breaches to serious safety violations and they are strictly enforced.With millions of passengers using the Metro every day, Dubai’s transport authorities have increasingly focused on discipline, safety and passenger experience. Officials say the fines are designed not to punish but to encourage responsible commuting and protect public safety.According to RTA guidance, penalties range widely depending on severity, with behavioural infractions attracting smaller fines and safety-related violations attracting the maximum penalties.The most common fines come from everyday mistakes that many commuters may not realise are violations. Watch out as Dh100 fines include:These are considered etiquette or behavioural breaches but can still add up if repeated frequently.More serious violations relate to fare evasion, cleanliness and misuse of transport services. Watch out as Dh200 fines include:As for Dh500 fines, they include:These penalties aim to discourage fare fraud and maintain the Metro’s strict cleanliness standards.Sleeping in prohibited areas including shelters and restricted zones, carries a Dh300 fine, highlighting how even seemingly harmless actions can attract penalties.The highest fines are reserved for actions that could endanger passengers or disrupt operations. Watch out as Dh1,000 fines include:Meanwhile, Dh2,000 fines include:These violations are treated seriously due to the potential risk to lives and infrastructure.Metro users driving to stations also face penalties. Vehicles parked beyond permitted times at Metro car parks can attract Dh100 per day fines, capped at Dh1,000. Transport experts say strict penalties are part of Dubai’s strategy to maintain global-standard public transport systems.The city aims to keep its Metro safe, hygienic and efficient, especially as ridership grows due to tourism, population expansion and sustainability initiatives. RTA officials stress that compliance with signage and inspector instructions is crucial to preventing overcrowding, accidents and disruptions.Dubai’s Metro is central to the emirate’s smart mobility and sustainability goals, reducing traffic congestion and carbon emissions. Ensuring passengers follow rules helps keep the system reliable, a key factor as Dubai prepares for major expansions like new lines and rising commuter volumes.Commuter checklist:Dubai Metro fines range from Dh100 for minor etiquette breaches to Dh2,000 for serious safety violations, reflecting the city’s zero-tolerance approach to misconduct on public transport. With millions relying on the Metro daily, authorities say strict enforcement is essential to maintaining safety, efficiency and a world-class commuting experience.","Dubai’s ultra-modern Metro system is known for being fast, clean and efficient.

Abu Dhabi pet registration process



The Health Check: The vet will perform a medical examination to ensure the animal is healthy and up-to-date on its annual vaccinations.

The Microchip Requirement: A permanent microchip is mandatory. If your pet isn't chipped, the vet will install one, as the chip’s unique number is the primary key for the digital file.

TAMM Integration: The vet uploads the medical and microchip data directly to the government portal. Once uploaded, the owner will receive a notification to log into the TAMM app using their UAE Pass to confirm ownership and receive an official Animal Ownership Certificate.

Why does your pet need a digital ID?





Starting February 3, 2026, owning a pet in Abu Dhabi officially comes with a new set of digital responsibilities.The Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT) has launched a mandatory pet registration system designed to bring every cat and dog into a secure, centralized database.By linking every pet to an owner via the TAMM platform, authorities can now provide better protection, monitor health trends, and manage the city's animal population with precision.The government has made the process as frictionless as possible to encourage early compliance. Registration is currently free of charge for all residents.To get started, pet owners must visit a licensed veterinary clinic in Abu Dhabi.While the law officially kicks in on February 3, the government is prioritizing education over immediate punishment.Individual pet owners are being granted a generous one-year grace period to complete the registration.However, this window is much smaller for businesses; pet shops, shelters, and commercial breeders must have all their animals registered within six months.Once these grace periods expire, the ""soft approach"" ends, failure to register a pet or keep its record updated will result in a Dh1,000 fine.This shift brings immediate practical benefits to the average resident. The most significant ""Common Impact"" is the recovery of lost pets.

"Watch: Sharjah Police cracks down on 8 drivers for dangerous driving stunts during rain, seize vehicles",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/watch-sharjah-police-cracks-down-on-8-drivers-for-dangerous-driving-stunts-during-rain-seize-vehicles/articleshow/127814076.cms,"Sharjah's Rainy Roads Turn Into Danger Zone: Police Take Action Against 8 Stunt Drivers

Rain turns Sharjah roads into a backdrop for reckless stunts

Penalties reflect tough stance on road safety in Sharjah



Part of a broader safety push across the UAE



Community cooperation urged to preserve safety in Sharjah



Looking ahead: Road safety culture and enforcement in Sharjah







Sharjah Police have launched a decisive legal crackdown on motorists caught performing dangerous driving stunts during rainfall, seizing multiple vehicles and initiating action against eight drivers whose reckless behaviour risked lives on public roads. The incident, which went viral on social media as footage circulated of cars skidding and spinning on wet tarmac, underscores a growing focus by UAE law enforcement on combating reckless behaviour and enhancing road safety across the emirate.Last week, heavy rain in Sharjah brought a wave of unusual behaviour from some motorists who turned the slick roads into an impromptu playground for dangerous stunts. Sharjah Police, upon reviewing visual evidence and footage shared online, took action against eight drivers who were filmed pushing the limits of control in their vehicles, not only endangering their own lives but also threatening the safety of fellow road users.Authorities emphasised that such conduct is not a harmless thrill but a serious violation of federal traffic laws due to the inherently dangerous conditions rain creates, where reduced tire grip and increased stopping distances heighten the risk of loss of control and collisions. The Traffic and Patrols Directorate warned that what may start as a fun stunt can “turn moments of enjoyment into life-threatening scenarios,” especially when vehicles slide unpredictably on wet surfaces.Under the UAE’s Federal Traffic Law, the drivers apprehended face multiple penalties. For driving in a manner that endangers life and public safety, each offender will be fined AED 2,000 and receive 23 black points on their licence, along with vehicle impoundment of up to 60 days under Article 1(A). An additional offence, operating a vehicle on the road without licence plates, carries AED 3,000 in fines, an additional 23 black points and up to 90 days of impoundment under Article 4.Police noted that accumulating the yearly limit of 24 black points can lead to licence suspension and court proceedings, ensuring that repeated offenders may face even harsher consequences. This strong enforcement action reflects broader efforts to deter dangerous driving behaviour, particularly in challenging weather conditions when the margin for error is smaller and the potential cost in human life is higher.The Sharjah crackdown fits into a larger pattern of enforcement and public safety messaging across the UAE. In recent months, law enforcement agencies in other emirates have also taken firm action against reckless behaviour behind the wheel. For example, Dubai Police impounded a high-performance vehicle and took legal action after a driver posted clips of dangerous stunts online, highlighting risks posed by showboating on public streets.Similarly, Abu Dhabi Police arrested a driver livestreaming while weaving through traffic, emphasising that reaching for social media views should never come at the cost of road safety. These combined efforts echo steadfast guidance from traffic authorities that dangerous driving, whether fuelled by weather spectacle, social media or thrill-seeking, will not be tolerated.Sharjah’s current enforcement also reflects how authorities are applying existing traffic law provisions to changing behaviour patterns. According to a driving regulation guide issued by the Sharjah Police, violations such as driving dangerously or operating a vehicle without proper documentation attract significant fines, black points and vehicle confiscation periods, all designed to serve as strong deterrents.Police have not only punished the eight drivers but also appealed to the public to play an active role in monitoring and reporting unsafe driving practices. Members of the community were urged to report serious traffic violations immediately by dialling 999 for emergencies or 901 for non-emergency cases, reinforcing the idea that road safety is a shared responsibility between authorities and residents alike.The emphasis on such public participation reflects a broader traffic safety strategy in the UAE; one where enforcement, awareness and community vigilance work in tandem. Authorities contend that encouraging responsible driving habits is as important as penalising reckless conduct, especially during adverse conditions like rain, which already elevate risk levels.Weather-related road incidents, even when not involving stunts, are known to heighten risk. Rain reduces tire traction, increases braking distances and can dramatically change a vehicle’s handling characteristics. While many drivers adapt to these conditions with caution, others misjudge their vehicle’s capabilities or overestimate their own skills. What might appear to be fun (such as spinning tires or drifting on wet roads) can quickly turn into serious crashes with injuries or fatalities.Traffic authorities have repeatedly stressed that rain is not an invitation to test driving limits but a time for heightened caution. In wet conditions, even routine manoeuvres require slower speeds, longer following distances and mindful steering, lessons often reinforced by accident statistics and public safety campaigns.While the legal action against the eight drivers has made headlines, it also serves as a cautionary tale for drivers across the UAE. As authorities step up enforcement and penalties remain stringent, motorists are reminded that public roadways are shared spaces where individual choices can have far-reaching consequences.Reckless behaviour of whether performing stunts, livestreaming while driving or ignoring hazardous conditions, does not only risk fines and impoundment. It can lead to serious injuries, loss of life and long-term legal consequences such as licence suspension and court appearances. Sharjah Police’s message is clear: enjoying weather and scenic conditions should never come at the cost of safety. The emirate’s legal action underscores a firm commitment to preserving lives, reducing road accidents and fostering a culture of responsible driving that protects all road users.","Sharjah Police have launched a legal crackdown on motorists caught performing dangerous driving stunts during rainfall.

As preparations for Ramadan begin to gather pace, the Ministry of Commerce has announced the launch of the Ramadan sales season, a nationwide initiative designed to help consumers shop early and ease pressure during the peak festive period. The sales season will run for 54 days, starting on February 1 and continuing until March 26, 2026.The timing of the campaign has been aligned with the Islamic calendar as well, beginning on Shaban 13 and concluding on Shawwal 7. By extending the sales window well beyond the end of Ramadan and through Eid Al-Fitr , the ministry aims to reduce last-minute congestion in markets and allow households to plan their purchases in a more relaxed manner.The Ramadan sales season covers a wide range of products linked to the holy month and the subsequent Eid celebrations. This includes all Ramadan-related goods as well as Eid necessities, ensuring that consumers can access discounts across essential categories throughout the period, rather than being limited to a short festive window.Also Read: Ramadan 2026: Expected dates, fasting hours, and seasonal shifts explained To support businesses, the Ministry of Commerce has invited retail establishments and online stores to participate by applying for discount permits electronically through the official platform sales.mc.gov.sa.The ministry clarified that taking part in the Ramadan sales season will not deduct from an establishment’s annual discount balance. This means businesses can obtain, print, and display official permits without losing any of their allocated discount days for the year, making participation simpler and more flexible.Consumer transparency is a key part of the initiative. Shoppers can verify the authenticity of discounts by scanning the barcode displayed on the official permit using their mobile phone camera. Once scanned, the system provides complete information about the offer, including the type and percentage of the discount, its duration, and basic details of the establishment offering it.The ministry also confirmed that inspection teams will conduct field tours across all regions of the Kingdom throughout the sales season. These inspections are aimed at monitoring compliance, verifying the legitimacy of promotional offers, and ensuring that advertised discounts match the information approved under the official permits.","The Ramadan sales season will run for 54 days, starting on February 1 and continuing until March 26, 2026.

“

Storm Chandra

will bring persistent rain, heavy at times, later Monday and overnight before steadily clearing northeastwards on Tuesday morning. 30–50mm rainfall is likely widely, with 60–80mm across some higher ground, especially south Dartmoor. Falling on saturated ground, this is likely to lead to flooding and disruption, particularly on Tuesday morning. Strong southeasterly winds are also expected.”

“Whilst accumulating snow is unlikely at low-levels, there will be a sharp increase in snow depths with elevation, with the potential for 2–5cm in places above about 300m, 5–10cm above 400m, and 10–20cm above 500m. This may impact some high-level routes, with drifting possible in rather brisk southeasterly winds. Strong, gusty winds, especially to the west of hills, may exacerbate the potential for transport disruption.”

“Storm Chandra will bring a range of hazards to the UK through Monday night and Tuesday. Initially strong winds will impact the Isles of Scilly, western Cornwall and southwest Wales which are still vulnerable after Storm Goretti, gusts of 70 to 80mph are possible here. Heavy rain is an additional hazard as it falls on saturated ground in Dorset and southern parts of Devon, Somerset and Cornwall.

As Chandra interacts with colder air further north snow becomes a hazard, with 10–20cm of snow possibly accumulating over higher ground in the Pennines, southern Scotland and the Highlands. With a complex spell of weather, it’s important people stay up to date with the forecast and any warnings in your area.”

The three items households are urged to have ready

First, a torch. British Gas recommends a battery-powered or wind-up (kinetic) torch to ensure light is available if electricity supplies are interrupted.

Second, spare batteries. Households are advised to stock up on appropriate batteries. such as AA or AAA, for torches and other essential devices.

Third, a backup charger for mobile phones. A portable battery pack with a charging cable can help people stay connected and access updates during an outage.

“You might even consider a battery-powered radio, to keep on top of local updates if you can’t use your mobile.”





The Met Office has issued a series of weather warnings covering snow, rain and wind from late Monday through Tuesday. These include a 17-hour yellow warning for rain and snow from midnight Tuesday until 5pm, an amber warning for wind in eastern Northern Ireland, and an amber warning for rain across parts of south-west England.Explaining the risk in the south of England, the Met Office said:In northern England and Scotland, snow rather than rain is the main concern. The Met Office warned:In a broader briefing on the storm, the Met Office said Storm Chandra will bring “a further spell of wet and windy conditions later Monday and into Tuesday”, with gusty winds initially affecting the Isles of Scilly, western Cornwall and south-west Wales before moving north through the Irish Sea.An amber warning for wind has been issued for eastern Northern Ireland, where gusts of 60–70mph are expected widely, with up to 75mph possible in coastal areas. Heavy rain falling on already saturated ground in south Devon, Dorset, southern Somerset and south-east Cornwall could lead to flooding, while colder air further north will turn precipitation into hill snow across northern England and Scotland.Met Office Chief Forecaster Paul Gundersen said:With the risk of power cuts rising during periods of severe weather, energy firm British Gas has urged households to make sure they have three key items readily available.British Gas added:While additional supplies such as non-perishable food and blankets can be useful, the focus of the advice is on lighting, communication and access to information during potential power disruptions as Storm Chandra moves across the UK.","UK households urged to prepare torches, spare batteries and phone chargers ahead of potential power cuts.

Samuel was sent this picture as claimed proof of delivery, though he pointed out the phone should have been signed for (Kennedy News and Media)





A delivery driver has been removed after home security footage appeared to show him faking the delivery of a £1,200 iPhone and driving away with the parcel instead.Samuel Taylor, 20, from Rochdale, ordered a £1,264 iPhone 17 Pro Max through Giffgaff, with delivery handled by DPD. On 19 January, Taylor received a photo notification claiming the parcel had been posted through his letterbox. When he returned home from work, the phone was nowhere to be found. His father confirmed no delivery had taken place.Footage from the family’s security camera showed a courier pulling up outside the house, selecting a parcel from his van and approaching the front door. Moments later, the driver appeared to walk back to the vehicle still holding the same package before driving off.“I was shocked,” Taylor said. “When I got home my dad said it wasn’t actually there. We checked the cameras and saw what happened. I was just really annoyed and I feel robbed.”Taylor contacted DPD to complain but said he was initially told the phone had been delivered and advised to raise the issue with Giffgaff. Instead, he reported the incident to Greater Manchester Police and posted the footage on social media in an effort to force the company to respond.“Since DPD are not interested in their driver not delivering my £1,200 iPhone I thought I’d shame them on here,” he wrote.Reviewing the footage later, Taylor said it became clear the driver appeared unaware he was being recorded, ruling out the possibility of an administrative mix-up or a delayed return to the depot.“I don’t think he noticed the cameras,” Taylor said. “I thought it might’ve gone back to the warehouse, but we got in touch with DPD and they said it hadn’t been signed back in.DPD later confirmed that the driver had been “removed from the business” following an internal investigation. A spokesperson said: “We have carried out a thorough investigation and can confirm that the driver has been removed from the business. We have a zero-tolerance approach to incidents such as this and will always take firm action. We apologise whole-heartedly to Mr Taylor and have informed Giffgaff.”Giffgaff said the proof of delivery did not meet its standards and confirmed Taylor’s deposit had been refunded while the case is reviewed. “We’re sorry to hear that Samuel did not receive his new iPhone as intended,” a spokesperson said.Taylor said he still has not received the phone and no longer trusts the courier. “With something that expensive it has to be signed for anyway,” he said. “I just want the phone I paid for.”","Samuel Taylor, 20, from Rochdale, ordered a £1,264 iPhone 17 Pro Max through Giffgaff, with delivery handled by DPD.

Why hundreds of bald eagles are flocking to northern British Columbia’s frozen mountains during winter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/why-hundreds-of-bald-eagles-are-flocking-to-northern-british-columbias-frozen-mountains-during-winter/articleshow/126672217.cms,"Source: X

Why British Columbia’s winter landscapes draw bald eagles together



Bald eagles and rare winter group behaviour



What winter eagle gatherings reveal to scientists







In the frozen mountains of northern British Columbia, there was the unusual occurrence of a rare incident in the wildlife scene where the bald eagles were gathered in their hundreds in one spot, and in the middle of winter. Against the background of mountains laden with snow and the icy river valley, the sight was quite outstanding and unusual. For bald eagles, which stand out in their status as symbols of freedom, power, and dominance in nature, it was highly unusual for them to congregate in such huge numbers because they were predominantly lone animals and territorial in their behaviour patterns. The severity of the weather seemed to have had a huge effect on the eagles, as only limited spaces were available and where their feeds were still accessible, forcing unprecedented gatherings that stunned researchers and local communities alike. Such rare congregations offer scientists valuable insight into how climate stress reshapes wildlife behaviour and survival strategies.The northern area of British Columbia is important to the wintering survival of bald eagles. Though much of this area will freeze, there will always be fast-moving rivers that are partially open, providing the eagles with readily available fish. Rivers that support salmon are usually connected, forming pathways to life-sustaining riverways.As winter approaches and the temperature cools, bald eagles from an increasingly vast area will migrate to these feeding grounds, and many will be seen in one small area.The harsh environment imposed by winter causes a shift in bald eagles' normal habits. The immobility brought by snow, the uninhabitability of lakes due to ice, and the shorter daylight hours make energy conservation essential. The habit of securing territories disappears, with eagles seeking locations close to food sources. The movement of prey through the snow-covered environment is predictable, helping the eagles modify their hunting patterns. What seems like a rare concentration of birds is, in actual fact, a decision based on survival that is influenced by the environment.In areas outside breeding colonies or feeding grounds, however, bald eagles tend to be alone. Adults do not compete with each other, particularly around feeding areas. To witness so many of them assemble at one place is a clear indication that their social norms have been temporarily overlooked. Experts say that it is possible only in areas where food is plentiful and accessible. In such areas, even though competition may be a disadvantage, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to observe their flexibility in handling their socialisation.The group behaviours exhibited during winter are very advantageous in several ways. The eagles can view each other in search of food, thus saving time looking for it in the frozen land. Additionally, the dominant eagles will either jump over the ice or find a source of food first as an indirect means of providing for the rest of the group members. The younger and weaker eagles are able to get protection by staying in a group, thus minimising the chances of starvation.Large winter gatherings offer a unique opportunity to study bald eagles under environmental stress. Scientists are able to estimate population size, age structure, feeding patterns, and social tolerance. It helps them to get an idea about the resiliency of the species towards extreme weather and habitat pressure. This kind of data is very crucial in view of changing climatic cycles that disturb food availability and migration behaviour in an ecosystem.The sight of hundreds of eagles in one place often plays the role of a sign of ecological vigour: healthy fish populations, undisrupted waterways, and preserved forest habitats. These aggregations are the natural barometers by which environmental health is spotlighted, emphasising those areas where ecosystems are healthy and working. Such observations also guide conservation planning, policy decisions, habitat restoration priorities, and long-term monitoring strategies across regions facing climate variability.","The sight of hundreds of bald eagles in one place is a sign of ecological vigour.

Why this theory refuses to die

The unglamorous truth





Every few years, Stanley Kubrick dies again. Not in reality — in the imagination of the internet, which keeps resurrecting him as a martyr every time it rediscovers Eyes Wide Shut and decides the film was not art, not allegory, but a warning.This latest revival arrives via a viral X thread built around a familiar clip from Eyes Wide Shut: masked elites, ritualised menace, and a caption doing all the heavy lifting — They killed Stanley Kubrick. It is the kind of post that does not argue, does not explain, and does not need to. In the Epstein era, implication has replaced evidence.What the thread is really selling is not a claim about 1999. It is a mood about now. A belief that the powerful do unspeakable things behind closed doors, and that anyone who shows us the door gets removed from the building.The conspiracy begins with timing, then gets promoted to theologyKubrick died of a heart attack on March 7, 1999, aged 70, days after screening what he described as the final cut of Eyes Wide Shut for the studio. That is the factual core.Everything else is architecture built on proximity. A few days becomes too close.A heart attack becomes convenient. A final cut becomes unfinished truth. Kubrick — already mythologised as secretive, obsessive, and distrustful of studios — becomes the perfect protagonist for suspicion because he does not feel like a man who simply dies. He feels like a man who is stopped.The villain, inevitably, is Warner Bros., accused of panicking after Kubrick’s death and excising scenes that supposedly exposed elite sexual rituals, child sacrifice, and organised depravity. No scripts. No verified footage. No paper trail. Just vibes, passed around as certainty.Strip away the internet’s interpretive gymnastics and Eyes Wide Shut is something far less sensational and far more Kubrickian.It is not an exposé. It is an erotic psychological drama about class, access, jealousy, and humiliation. The masked ritual is not a documentary insert. It is allegory — Kubrick doing what he always did: using spectacle to show how power behaves when it is unaccountable.The horror does not come from what is shown, but from how it is shown: the calmness of authority, the politeness of menace, the certainty that rules exist you will never be allowed to read. Kubrick was never interested in naming villains. He was interested in systems.At its core, Eyes Wide Shut follows a wealthy New York doctor whose marriage is destabilised when his wife calmly admits she once fantasised about another man. It is not infidelity that unravels him, but the discovery that desire exists beyond his control. Shaken, he spends a night drifting through the city, pulled into a chain of sexual encounters and near-encounters — prostitutes, intermediaries, coded invitations — until he infiltrates a masked gathering in a mansion where sex, power, and hierarchy are ritualised into theatre.At each stop, the illusion of choice dissolves. He believes he is participating. He is merely tolerated. When he is identified as an outsider, the response is not violence but certainty. He is warned to forget. By morning, he returns to domestic normalcy chastened, aware that the world he briefly glimpsed is real, ordered, and utterly indifferent to him. The film is not about sex so much as humiliation — the humiliation of learning that privilege has limits, and that beyond those limits lie rooms you are not meant to enter, even if the door briefly opens.The latest surge owes much to a resurfaced podcast clip featuring Roger Avary, one of the credited co-writers on Eyes Wide Shut, speaking on The Joe Rogan Experience.Avary suggests that post-production decisions were taken after Kubrick’s death. That is unremarkable. Films are finished this way all the time. What Avary does not claim is that the studio removed scenes depicting child sacrifice, elite pedophile rings, or satanic cults. Those details are supplied later by the audience, not the speaker.Conspiracy culture thrives on ellipses. A pause becomes proof. A maybe becomes a manifesto.The Kubrick theory did not originate with Jeffrey Epstein — but Epstein transformed it.Once Epstein’s crimes became public, something broke in the collective imagination. The comforting assumption that elite abuse could not exist at scale collapsed. The idea that “they would never get away with it” stopped sounding naïve and started sounding dishonest.From that moment on, fictional depictions of elite depravity were reread as confessions. Eyes Wide Shut became prophetic. Kubrick became a whistleblower. Epstein became the missing footnote. The ritual scene became evidence. And every unanswered question became confirmation of suppression.The problem is mundane but fatal to the theory: Epstein’s crimes were real and documented. Eyes Wide Shut was adapted from a novella written in 1926. The overlap is emotional, not evidentiary.Where the conspiracy gains traction is not in facts, but in aesthetics and structure. The parallels are visual, social, and psychological — enough to feel uncanny without being causal.First, there is the geography of power. In Eyes Wide Shut, the ritual takes place in an isolated mansion, accessible only through invitation and compliance. Epstein’s world, as later revealed, operated through similarly controlled spaces: private islands, gated townhouses, aircraft with restricted passenger lists. Power, in both cases, is not loud. It is secluded.Second, there is the language of hierarchy. Kubrick’s ritual is less about sex than about rank — who wears which mask, who speaks, who is allowed to stay. Epstein’s operation functioned through comparable ladders: recruiters, intermediaries, facilitators, patrons. Proximity to power determined immunity.Third, there is the mechanism of silence. In the film, the protagonist is not threatened with death so much as erasure. He is told, calmly, that forgetting would be wise. Epstein’s influence rested on similar dynamics: legal intimidation, reputational pressure, non-disclosure, and the quiet assurance that consequences flow in only one direction.Finally, there is the illusion of choice. Kubrick’s characters believe they are acting freely until they realise the rules were written long before they arrived. Accounts from Epstein’s orbit describe a comparable trap — consent blurred by manipulation, dependency, and asymmetry.These similarities are real enough to unsettle. They are also broad enough to be universal. This is how power often looks, whether in fiction or in life.When people say “the Epstein files”, they are usually referring to a debris field rather than a single smoking gun: court filings, depositions, contact books, flight logs, schedules, emails, photographs, investigative materials, and later releases that arrive piecemeal and often out of context.Two things can be true at once. Epstein cultivated proximity to powerful people. Proximity, by itself, is not proof of participation in his crimes. The internet hates that distinction.Consider the recurring claims that “the files confirm everything”.There are unsealed court materials that name public figures, often as part of witness testimony or third-party references. Names appearing in documents are repeatedly treated as convictions rather than context. There are contact books that resemble address directories, which get rebranded online as “client lists”. There are flight logs that show who travelled with Epstein, which are then treated as proof of criminal involvement regardless of timing, purpose, or corroboration.There are also email caches and schedules that reveal something more prosaic and more unsettling: Epstein’s skill at networking. He placed himself among academics, politicians, financiers, and celebrities by offering access, money, and introductions. That social proximity looks conspiratorial when collapsed into screenshots. In reality, it often reveals opportunism rather than orchestration.And then there are the administrative failures — redactions missed, documents released and reprocessed — which fuel the idea that something vast is being hidden, when what they often demonstrate is institutional mess.This is the key problem. Partial visibility plus moral outrage produces maximum misinformation.Once Epstein is invoked, the narrative often slides into adrenochrome harvesting and satanic rites — claims with no evidentiary basis, recycled from older conspiracy traditions and given a modern aesthetic.At this point, the Kubrick myth stops pretending to be about Kubrick and becomes a delivery mechanism for something older and darker. The ritual scene becomes a Rorschach test. Those predisposed to believe in hidden cabals treat cinema as surveillance footage. Those familiar with Kubrick treat it as symbolism, nightmare logic, and class anxiety rendered as theatre.Both groups are watching the same frames. Only one insists it is journalism.The Kubrick–Epstein myth survives because it is perfectly optimised for the internet. Kubrick himself invites it. He was secretive, meticulous, and famously distrustful of studios. Eyes Wide Shut denies closure. It ends not with revelation, but with discomfort. Power remains intact, and that irritates people. And Epstein permanently altered the conspiracy landscape. After him, elite criminality no longer sounds implausible. Everything unsettling gains retroactive credibility. But plausibility is not proof. Suspicion is not scholarship.There is no credible evidence that Stanley Kubrick was assassinated. There is no verified evidence that Eyes Wide Shut originally contained scenes of child sacrifice or a literal depiction of an Epstein-style trafficking ring. There is also no need for any of that to be true for the film to feel disturbing.Kubrick’s point survives without the martyr myth. Power is opaque. Access is controlled. The elite operate by rules they do not explain to those beneath them. That is not a secret. That is sociology.The internet prefers the version where the director becomes the sacrifice, because that version flatters the audience. If Kubrick was killed for revealing “the truth”, then watching the clip makes you brave. If Kubrick was simply making art about class and desire, then watching the clip makes you a person on your phone.And that is a far less cinematic role.","Eyes Wide Shut is an erotic psychological drama about class, access, jealousy, and humiliation. The masked ritual is not a documentary insert. It is allegory — Kubrick doing what he always did: using spectacle to show how power behaves when it is unaccountable.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127881368,imgsize-109598,width-400,resizemode-4/a-still-from-eyes-wide-shut.jpg"
"Stanford students pretend to be Jains to escape $7,944 mandatory meal plan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/stanford-students-pretend-to-be-jains-to-escape-7944-mandatory-meal-plan/articleshow/127872443.cms,"How Jain identity entered the Stanford dining debate

Online reaction and wider debate





A Stanford student essay claimed that some undergraduates falsely identify as Jain to bypass the university’s $7,944 mandatory meal plan. The allegation, which has circulated widely on social media, suggests that students use religious dietary exemptions to redirect their dining funds to off-campus grocery stores such as Whole Foods, where they believe food options are fresher or better suited to their preferences. The claim is based on anecdotal observations and student conversations rather than official university records.The controversy stems from an opinion essay written by Stanford undergraduate Sebastian Connolly and published in The New York Times. Connolly described a campus culture of “optimisation,” arguing that students openly discuss ways to work around rules, including claiming Jain identity to qualify for dining exemptions. The essay did not present institutional figures or disciplinary cases, instead relying on personal observation and student conversations.Jainism has strict dietary principles that emphasise non-violence toward all living beings. Followers typically follow a strict vegetarian diet, avoiding meat, fish, eggs, and foods that involve harm to living organisms. Many Jains also avoid root vegetables such as onions, garlic, potatoes, and carrots, as harvesting them can kill the entire plant and disturb microorganisms in the soil.Because of these constraints, many universities, including Stanford, allow religious accommodations when campus dining cannot reasonably meet such requirements. Students granted exemptions may be permitted to opt out of standard meal plans and spend dining funds elsewhere.Stanford requires most undergraduates living on campus to enrol in a meal plan. The university also states that exemptions can be granted for documented religious or medical reasons. However, the institution does not publicly release data on how many students claim religious dietary exemptions, how those claims are reviewed, or whether misuse is investigated.The claim has fuelled wider debate over the cost of college meal plans, the quality of campus dining, and how accommodation systems are used. Some commentators say it reflects growing frustration among students with expensive and inflexible dining rules. Others caution that unverified allegations should not be confused with the practices of the religion itself, noting that the issue, if it exists, concerns individual behaviour rather than Jain dietary traditions.Beyond Stanford, the issue points to a wider strain across universities. Students are facing rising costs and limited flexibility, pushing some to look for any lawful way to stretch their budgets. At the same time, universities depend on trust-based systems to honour genuine religious and medical needs without turning accommodations into an exercise in policing identity.","Stanford student essay claimed that some undergraduates falsely identify as Jain to bypass the university’s $7,944 mandatory meal plan.

Who built Jmail and what they were trying to prove

How the inbox changes the reading experience





Sifting through large document dumps is usually a tedious exercise, even when the material is of major public interest. That has been the case with emails linked to Jeffrey Epstein, which have circulated in the public domain as scanned PDFs, plain text files, and images released through court cases and official disclosures. A recent web project changes that experience entirely. Instead of forcing readers to jump between files, it presents the emails inside a familiar, Gmail-style interface, making the archive feel like a real inbox and turning a messy collection of documents into something far easier to explore, search, and understand.The project, known as Jmail, recreates the look and behaviour of Google’s email service while relying only on material that is already public. There is no new data and no private access involved. The aim is usability rather than revelation: to make existing records readable without specialist tools or hours of manual sorting.Jmail was created by Riley Walz, described by Wired as a prankster and internet artist, working alongside web developer Luke Igel. Rather than treating the Epstein emails as raw evidence to be mined for new revelations, the pair approached them as both a technical challenge and a cultural problem.Their central question was not what the emails contained, but how the way information is presented shapes who engages with it and who does not.The creators have framed Jmail as an experiment in accessibility. Public records, they argue, are often technically available but practically unusable, buried in fragmented files that discourage close reading. By rebuilding the archive in a familiar format, they sought to expose the gap between transparency in principle and transparency in practice.The interface mirrors the conventions of a standard email client. Messages are clearly divided between sent and received folders, conversations are grouped into threads, and a search bar allows users to look up names, dates, and keywords instantly. These small design decisions dramatically alter how the material can be navigated. Instead of skimming isolated documents, users can follow patterns of correspondence and timelines with minimal friction.For journalists and researchers, this reduces the time spent on basic organisation and increases the time available for analysis. For general readers, the familiar layout removes the intimidation factor that often accompanies large document dumps, making engagement more likely.Although the presentation can feel provocative, Jmail functions primarily as a research aid rather than a stunt. It does not introduce new information or private data, nor does it claim to reveal hidden material. Its significance lies in how it demonstrates that interface design can influence whether public records are ignored, misunderstood, or meaningfully examined.","The project, known as Jmail, recreates the look and behaviour of Google’s email service while relying only on material that is already public.

The bottom line





For years, Elon Musk has said the same thing whenever his name surfaced in connection with Jeffrey Epstein . Epstein, Musk insisted, tried repeatedly to get him to visit his private Caribbean island. Musk refused. He never went.The latest tranche of Epstein emails released by the US Justice Department does not contradict the claim that Musk never visited the island. What it does complicate is the idea that he never wanted to.Between late 2012 and the end of 2013, Musk and Epstein exchanged multiple emails discussing island visits, parties, schedules, and logistics. Some plans fell through. Others were cancelled. But the emails show Musk actively engaging in conversations about going.Here is what the documents reveal.After the release of the latest tranche of Epstein files, Musk again pushed back publicly, saying the emails were being misread and selectively amplified. Posting on X, he claimed there were “a lot of fake emails flying around” and argued that his writing style made fabrications easy to identify. Responding to the suggestion that he was seeking to party with young women, Musk said that “if I actually wanted to spend my time partying with young women, it would be trivial for me to do so without the help of a creepy loser like Epstein… But I don’t,” reiterating that he never visited Epstein’s island and never flew on his jet.However, the older emails now in the public record show Musk repeatedly engaging Epstein about social plans and potential visits, including asking about the “wildest party” on the island and proposing specific dates to go, complicating the notion of an outright refusal.Epstein raises the possibility of flying Musk to the island by helicopter.“how many people will you be for the heli to island”“Probably just Talulah and me. What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?”This exchange shows Musk not only responding but asking about the timing of parties on the island.Musk says he wants to “let loose” after an exhausting year and is looking for parties rather than a quiet retreat.“Do you have any parties planned? I’ve been working to the edge of sanity this year and so, once my kids head home after Christmas, I really want to hit the party scene in St Barts or elsewhere and let loose. The invitation is much appreciated, but a peaceful island experience is the opposite of what I’m looking for,”“Understood , I will see you on st Barth, the ratio on my island might make Talilah uncomfortable,”“Ratio is not a problem for Talulah,”The conversation shifts from Epstein’s island to St Barts, but the island remains part of the discussion.After weeks of discussion, Musk backs out.“Logistics won’t work this time around.”No moral objection is cited. The reason given is logistical.Epstein’s assistant notes that Musk cannot attend a gathering at Epstein’s “Ranch” but agrees to a professional meeting instead.“Elon Musk appreciates the invitation to the Ranch but has commitments… Lunch on Monday Feb.25th at 1pm at Space X is confirmed”Epstein invites Musk to New York during the UN General Assembly, pitching it as a social gathering.“any plans for ny . the opening of the [general] assembly has many interesting people coming to the house”“I run and lead product design/engineering for two complicated companies. Moreover, SpaceX is about to launch what is arguably the most advanced rocket in history. Flying to NY to see UN diplomats do nothing would be an unwise use of time.”“Do you think i am re*****,”“Just kidding , there is no one over 25 and all very cute.”The reply would later draw scrutiny for both its language and implications.Musk says he will be in the Caribbean and asks directly about visiting.“Will be in the BVI/St Bart’s area over the holidays. Is there a good time to visit?”“any day 1st - 8th . play it by ear if you want. always space for you,”“I will come and get you,”Musk proposes visiting the island on January 2. Epstein ultimately cancels.“When should we head to your island on the 2nd?”“Bad news- Unfortunately , my schedule will keep me in New York . I was really looking forward to finally spending some time together with just fun as the agenda. so i am very disappointed. Hopefully we can schedule another time in the near future,”The emails do not show Elon Musk visiting Jeffrey Epstein’s island. They do not show him flying on Epstein’s plane or attending Epstein’s parties. What they do show is repeated engagement: questions about parties, discussions of timing, proposed dates, and an explicit plan to go that fell through only because Epstein was unavailable. They also show that Musk remained in touch with Epstein even after 2008, when Epstein was first convicted. The gap between Musk’s later public denials and the tone of these private emails is what has drawn renewed scrutiny — not what happened, but what was clearly considered.","The latest tranche of Epstein emails released by the US Justice Department does not contradict the claim that Musk never visited the island.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.
