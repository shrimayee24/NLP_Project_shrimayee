Apple iPhone 17e price (expected)

Apple is reportedly gearing up to announce the successor to last year’s iPhone 16e. Likely to be called iPhone 17e, the smartphone “is due imminently”, claims Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman in the latest edition of his weekly PowerOn newsletter. “Apple will market the 17e heavily to users in emerging economies and enterprises — two areas the company plans to target aggressively this year with both devices and software,” Gurman writes in the newsletter. He also shared that the phone will come with a few “big changes” that include iPhone 17’s A19 chipset and MagSafe charging, among others.The upcoming iPhone 17e, Gurman says will be powered by the A19 chip that comes with iPhone 17. The A19 offers a modest boost in CPU speed compared to the A18, but most of its improvement is in GPU, thus allowing it to be even better for AI features and gaming.Further, the handset is tipped to get MagSafe charging feature. Another change coming the iPhone 17e is that it may be equipped with Apple’s newest in-house cellular and wireless chips.Korean news outlet The Elec previously reported that the iPhone 17e is expected to feature slimmer display bezels while retaining the iPhone 14-era OLED panel. Other major new features include an 18MP front camera with Center Stage. This camera automatically extends to show everybody in a group selfie, even when you hold the phone vertically.As far as the pricing of the upcoming iPhone 17e is concerned, Gurman says that the company is planning to keep pricing the same as iPhone 16e. To recall, iPhone 16e launched in 2025 with a price tag of $599 or Rs 59,900 in India.","Apple is reportedly gearing up to announce the successor to last year’s iPhone 16e.

Korean 'Love Game' Under Lens After Ghaziabad Sisters Suicide Raises Alarm On Digital Addiction





GHAZIABAD: Police probing the alleged suicides of three sisters in Bharat City have recovered incremental data from a mobile phone sold by their father days before their deaths, finding that the girls spent almost 20 hours a day on the device watching Korean content, cartoons and gaming.The handset - picked up from an electronics shop in Shalimar Garden on Monday - also contains viewing and gaming material that the sisters listed in their suicide note last week, police said.The three sisters - aged 16, 14 and 12 - were found lying next to each other on the society's premises, directly below their ninth-floor window, on Feb 4. They were taken to hospital and declared dead on arrival.Police said that the phone was sold by their father, Chetan Kumar, to the Shalimar Garden shop for Rs 15,000 about 15 days before the incident. The device had been sent for forensic examination to retrieve deleted data and map the girls' online activity and contacts.An officer said the phones were central to establishing what the sisters were consuming online and whether they were in touch with anyone outside the family. Data recovered so far shows the sisters were heavily invested in Korean culture, with K-pop featuring most prominently.The cops also found material linked to games named in the suicide note, including the horror titles Poppy Playtime, The Baby in Yellow, Ice Cream Man, Evil Nun and Ice Game.Patil said police had already sent a report to govt seeking a ban on these five games.""A request was sent to govt to ban these five games. As of now, we are trying to recover the other phone that the girls' father had sold off three months ago. We also need to scan the social media activity of the girls,"" the officer said.The recovered phone's YouTube history also shows an extensive list of Korean and Chinese songs, police said. Apart from Korean drama and films, the girls watched Chinese, Thai and Japanese content. Gaming videos and cartoons also featured prominently, such as Doraemon, Shinchan, PJ Masks, Masha and the Bear, Shimmer and Shine and Peppa Pig.The sisters' increasing fixation with everything Korean has also drawn attention to their isolation and growing dependence on an online fantasy life. The girls had stopped going to school after Covid and had few, if any, friends, becoming increasingly dependent on each other and on their phones. They had also started a YouTube channel in 2025 focused on K-dramas and cartoon characters, which grew to more than 2,000 followers, but was deleted about 10 days before their alleged suicides.The channel, police said, was removed after their father objected to their escalating obsession with Korean culture.A private tutor, who taught them briefly, also told police and family members that the girls introduced themselves to her with Korean names - Maria, Aliza and Cindy - and claimed they had been adopted from Korea and China.""They were very weak in studies. When I gave them basic calculations, like additions and multiplications, they failed to even recognise numbers. When I asked them about their Korean names, they said they had been adopted from China and Korea. I asked their father about it. He told me about their obsession,"" said the tutor, who stopped teaching them after a few sessions.It was around six months ago that Kumar had bought two phones for the eldest daughter and her 14-year-old half-sister, believing they would become ""famous like YouTubers"". He sold one of the phones three months ago, and the other one just 15 days before the suicides.","Police investigating alleged suicides of three sisters in Ghaziabad recovered data from a sold mobile phone, revealing extensive daily use for Korean content, cartoons, and gaming.

Four promises Elon Musk made to xAI employees after co-founders Tony Wu and Jimmy Ba announced their resignation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/four-promises-elon-musk-made-to-xai-employees-after-co-founders-tony-wu-and-jimmy-ba-announced-their-resignation/articleshow/128238564.cms,"

Elon Musk held an all-hands meeting with xAI employees hours after co-founders Tony Wu and Jimmy Ba announced their exits—the fifth and sixth from the 12-person founding team. Instead of addressing the departures head-on, Musk pitched a lunar satellite factory, a self-sustaining Moon city, a path to 1 billion daily active X users, and a company restructuring into four product teams. The meeting was later posted publicly on X.

Musk wants to build an AI satellite factory on the Moon

A self-sustaining lunar city before Mars

X is gunning for 1 billion daily active users

xAI is being restructured into four product teams

Elon Musk held an all-hands meeting with xAI employees on Tuesday night, just hours after co-founders Yuhuai (Tony) Wu and Jimmy Ba announced they were leaving the company. What followed was a 45-minute presentation that veered from product updates to lunar manufacturing plants.The meeting came at a sensitive moment. Wu and Ba are the fifth and sixth members of xAI's 12-person founding team to walk out the door, with five departures in the past year alone. Rather than dwell on the exits, Musk used the stage to lay out a series of ambitious promises for the company's future.The headline promise was a lunar facility that would manufacture AI-powered satellites and launch them into deep space using electromagnetic catapults, or ""mass drivers."" Musk painted a picture of satellites firing off the Moon's surface one after another, beaming data back to Earth or running compute locally. ""You have to go to the moon,"" he told employees. He described the Moon's low gravity, lack of atmosphere, and constant solar exposure as ideal conditions for this kind of infrastructure.Musk also outlined a stepping-stone approach to his long-standing Mars obsession. First, xAI and SpaceX would establish what he called ""a self-sustaining city on the moon,"" then push outward to Mars, and eventually to other star systems.He even floated the idea of finding ""remnants of ancient alien civilizations"" along the way.Back on Earth, Musk shared that X currently has around 600 million monthly active users and set a target of ""well over a billion"" daily active users. To get there, the company is planning new features including X Money, a banking tool, and a standalone chat app. Nikita Bier, X's head of product, added that the platform had just crossed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue from subscriptions.Musk acknowledged the co-founder departures as part of a broader reorganisation. The company is now split into four teams: Grok (the chatbot), a coding division, the Imagine video generator, and a project called Macrohard—described as a system that can ""do anything on a computer that a computer is able to do."" Toby Pohlen, who will lead Macrohard, told colleagues the goal is to have ""rocket engines fully designed by AI. ""The all-hands was later published as a video on X, possibly in response to The New York Times reporting details from the meeting earlier that evening. SpaceX completed its acquisition of xAI last week in a deal valuing the combined entity at $1.25 trillion, with an IPO expected as early as June.",Elon Musk held an all-hands meeting with xAI employees on Tuesday night.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

UAE Indians: Are You Ready for India's New Chip-Enabled e-Passport?

e-Passport application process for UAE residents







Indian expatriates in the United Arab Emirates are being urged to adopt India’s new chip-enabled e- Passport , a modern travel document designed to make international journeys faster, safer and more secure while aligning with global immigration standards. The rollout is part of India’s Passport Seva Programme 2.0 (GPSP 2.0), which modernises passport services through digital platforms and stronger security features.Unlike traditional passports, the e-Passport embeds a secure Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip that stores the holder’s biometric data, including photograph and fingerprints, in encrypted form directly inside the booklet. The presence of the embedded chip is usually identified by a small gold-coloured symbol on the front cover.This RFID-equipped document conforms to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards, meaning it is recognised globally for automated identity verification and enhanced security. UAE-based Indians can now apply for these e-Passports through the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi or the Consulate in Dubai, with the rollout officially starting in October 2025 under GPSP 2.0.One of the biggest advantages of the e-Passport is reduced immigration wait times, travellers using automated lanes such as SmartGates and e-gates at airports can move through border control much more quickly compared with manual checks.Reports indicate that such streamlined checks can cut average wait times from roughly 25 minutes to under five at key UAE airports.These faster channels are not limited to the UAE as Indian e-Passport holders may benefit from automated border controls in countries such as Singapore, Australia and others that support e-Passport infrastructure, making travel smoother for frequent flyers.The embedded chip in the e-Passport uses advanced encryption and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology to ensure that biometric and identity data is securely stored and authenticated at international checkpoints. This makes it significantly harder for fraudsters to tamper with or forge passport information, enhancing overall travel document integrity.Such security upgrades align with global efforts to reduce passport fraud and identity theft, giving travellers and authorities more confidence in document authenticity.The shift to e-Passports is part of a larger digital overhaul under Passport Seva Programme 2.0 (GPSP 2.0), an upgraded system for issuing passports that emphasises ease of application, transparency and online services. GPSP 2.0 enables applicants to upload photographs, signatures and documents online, reducing reliance on physical forms and cutting waiting times at service centres like BLS International.For Indian residents in the UAE, estimated at around 3.5 million, this means a digital, end-to-end passport application experience that lowers bureaucratic friction and improves user convenience.Yes, existing passports without a chip remain valid until their expiration. Indian missions in the UAE have clarified that no extra biometrics or fees are required solely because of the e-Passport rollout. Applicants who provided biometrics recently will not be asked to give them again just because of the new document type.However, travellers planning long-term travel or frequent international journeys are encouraged to transition early to the e-Passport to enjoy the full suite of benefits proactively.From October 28, 2025, all Indian passport applications in the UAE, including renewals and new passports, must be filed through the GPSP 2.0 portal, which supports online registration, document upload and appointment booking at BLS centres in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.Applicants should ensure their photographs comply with ICAO standards to avoid delays or rejection. These strict photo requirements were introduced in September 2025 and apply to all passport applications, including e-Passports.India’s new chip-enabled e-Passport represents a major leap in travel document technology, offering faster immigration processing, enhanced security and future-proof compatibility with global systems. For UAE-based Indians, applying now through the modern GPSP 2.0 digital process can mean smoother travel experiences both within the Gulf and around the world.","Indian expatriates in the United Arab Emirates are being urged to adopt India’s new chip-enabled e- Passport.

Early birds still get the best deals, especially in Economy Class



When is the Cheapest Time to Book Emirates Flights in 2026?

Takeaway:

Best booking windows: Strategy and seasonal trends



6–8 weeks before departure often yields lower Economy fares than booking at the last minute, especially for long-haul flights.

Booking mid-week (Tuesdays and Wednesdays) rather than weekends may further increase odds of a deal because airlines frequently adjust prices to stimulate bookings on slower days.

Off-peak travel months, such as shoulder seasons outside summer and major holidays, tend to offer better pricing than peak times like July or late December.

Use Emirates’ own tools and guarantees



Low Fare Calendar: Emirates’ official booking system shows a calendar view of fares, letting you compare prices across flexible dates and spot cheaper travel windows.

Emirates’ official booking system shows a calendar view of fares, letting you compare prices across flexible dates and spot cheaper travel windows. Best Price Guarantee: If you find a lower price elsewhere for the exact same Emirates flight, the airline promises to refund the difference (terms apply).

Mid-week and time-of-day tips



Mid-week bookings and mid-week travel often offer lower rates than weekend travel.

Some data, for airlines in general, suggest booking at odd hours (late night or early morning) can reveal hidden dips in dynamic pricing, though this is not specific to Emirates’ own official pricing logic.

If you are planning to fly with Emirates in 2026, whether for leisure, family trips or work, timing your booking right can make a significant difference in airfare costs. According to reports, Emirates just recorded its busiest January for family travel ever, with the majority of passengers booking two to three months in advance, showing that early planning often leads to better pricing and seat availability.Here’s how travelers can navigate Emirates pricing trends and save on flights this year.Emirates reports that most Economy Class seats for popular routes were claimed by travellers who booked weeks or months ahead of departure, particularly during school holiday periods and major travel seasons. More than 65% of family and group bookings happened at least two to three months before departure and that early demand helped the airline fill planes without resorting to heavy discounting later.Booking early, around 2–3 months before travel, increases chances of finding lower fares, especially for Economy and window seats on popular international routes.Industry fare trackers, including those used by travel experts, suggest some general sweet spots for airline bookings that align with Emirates pricing patterns:These timing strategies, while not unique to Emirates, are broadly supported by airfare analytics across global carriers and hint at fare behaviour that dynamic pricing systems often follow.Emirates offers some built-in online tools that can help budget-minded travelers -Using these features directly on emirates.com can ensure you are not overpaying and may unlock savings you would not find on third-party sites.Travel experts say fare fluctuations are influenced by how busy search engines and airlines’ pricing algorithms are at various times:Being flexible not only with how far ahead you book but also with your departure and return days can help uncover lower ticket prices.Historically, Emirates, like most airlines, charges a premium for last-minute bookings. Data suggest that fares typically increase sharply in the last few weeks before travel, especially during popular holiday windows like spring breaks, summer vacations and year-end festivals.That pattern echoes broader airline pricing behaviour, where demand surges close to departure force up prices as remaining seats get scarcer.Travel patterns show Emirates passengers prioritise family and group travel to destinations such as Dubai, Jeddah, Istanbul, Bangkok and Rome, often linked to school calendars and tourism peak periods and those patterns can push pricing up early.If your schedule allows flexibility, consider flying to high-demand destinations outside peak holiday periods to lock in better rates.While not specific to Emirates’ official pricing, some travel platforms and deal sites list seasonal promo codes and airline discounts (like 10% off offers) that can occasionally apply to Emirates bookings. These deals are typically time-limited and require quick action to redeem.Sign up for newsletter alerts, airline membership programs (e.g., Emirates Skywards) and fare trackers to catch these short-term discounts.If you fly often, Emirates’ Skywards loyalty program can further reduce effective costs through miles redemption for flights or upgrades, especially if you accumulate points via partners or co-branded credit cards. For travelers aiming to reduce fare expenses over time, this is a long-term strategy worth exploring alongside smart booking timing.For travellers eyeing better Emirates flight prices in 2026, timing is still one of the most powerful tools.

"Mysterious tunnels found beneath 5,000-year-old pagan graves in Germany leave experts stunned",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/mysterious-tunnels-found-beneath-5000-year-old-pagan-graves-in-germany-leave-experts-stunned/articleshow/128133862.cms,"Where the tunnels were found

What was found inside the tunnel





Archaeologists in Germany have uncovered a narrow medieval tunnel system hidden beneath a much older pagan burial site, a discovery that has surprised experts and raised new questions about how different eras interacted with the same landscape. The find was announced in a January 29 press release by the State Office for Heritage Management and Archaeology of Saxony-Anhalt, following excavations near Reinstedt. While the graves date back roughly 5,000 years to the Neolithic period, the underground passage was dug thousands of years later, during the late Middle Ages, creating a rare overlap of prehistoric and medieval activity at a single site.The tunnels were found within a Middle Neolithic burial complex associated with the Baalberge culture, which flourished in the 4th millennium BC. The site consists of a large ditch enclosure and several poorly preserved burials that were originally used for ritual and funerary purposes. Excavations were carried out ahead of planned wind turbine construction, a routine process in Germany that often precedes large infrastructure projects.Archaeologists initially believed they were uncovering a grave after encountering a trapezoidal pit and a stone slab at one end.Further excavation revealed that the feature continued downward into the loess subsoil and was in fact an erdstall, a narrow underground tunnel system typically dated to the late Middle Ages. Erdstalls are found in parts of Central Europe, but their purpose has long remained unclear.The underground passage contained late medieval pottery, an iron horseshoe, animal remains, numerous stones and traces of charcoal from a brief fire. At the narrowest point of the entrance, archaeologists found larger stones stacked together, suggesting the tunnel was intentionally sealed. These finds confirmed that the structure was man-made, used for a period of time, and deliberately closed.The most striking aspect of the discovery is its location. Medieval builders chose to dig the tunnel directly beneath a prehistoric pagan burial site, a decision that archaeologists say was unlikely to be accidental. One theory is that the ancient earthworks were still visible in the Middle Ages and provided a convenient landmark. Another possibility is cultural: medieval Christian communities may have avoided disturbing pagan graves, making such sites discreet places for hidden structures.The function of erdstalls remains debated. Scholars have suggested they may have served as temporary hiding places, storage spaces, or sites for ritual or cultic activity. The narrow dimensions of the Reinstedt tunnel and the limited evidence of long-term occupation support the idea of short-term or episodic use, rather than permanent habitation.","Archaeologists in Germany have uncovered a narrow medieval tunnel system hidden beneath a much older pagan burial site.

Greenland crisis boosted Danish apps designed to identify and help boycott US goods,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/greenland-crisis-boosted-danish-apps-designed-to-identify-and-help-boycott-us-goods/articleshow/128064201.cms,"AP file photo

Canada, Greenland Show Of Power Amid Trump's ‘Invasion’ Storm; 'Difficult Times Are...'





The makers of mobile apps designed to help shoppers identify and boycott American goods say they saw a surge of interest in Denmark and beyond after the recent flare-up in tensions over U.S. President Donald Trump's designs on Greenland.The creator of the ""Made O'Meter"" app, Ian Rosenfeldt, said he saw around 30,000 downloads of the free app in just three days at the height of the trans-Atlantic diplomatic crisis in late January out of more than 100,000 since it was launched in March.Apps offer practical help Rosenfeldt, who lives in Copenhagen and works in digital marketing, decided to create the app a year ago after joining a Facebook group of like-minded Danes hoping to boycott U.S. goods.""Many people were frustrated and thinking, 'How do we actually do this in practical terms,'"" the 53-year-old recalled. ""If you use a bar code scanner, it's difficult to see if a product is actually American or not, if it's Danish or not. And if you don't know that, you can't really make a conscious choice.""The latest version of ""Made O'Meter"" uses artificial intelligence to identify and analyze several products at a time, then recommend similar European-made alternatives.Users can set preferences, like ""No USA-owned brands"" or ""Only EU-based brands."" The app claims over 95% accuracy.""By using artificial intelligence, you can take an image of a product ... and it can make a deep dive to go out and find the correct information about the product in many levels,"" Rosenfeldt told The Associated Press during a demonstration at a Copenhagen grocery store. ""This way, you have information that you can use to take decisions on what you think is right.""'Losing an ally' After an initial surge of downloads when the app was launched, usage tailed off. Until last month, when Trump stepped up his rhetoric about the need for the U.S. to acquire Greenland, a strategically important and mineral-rich Arctic island that is a semiautonomous territory of Denmark.Usage peaked Jan. 23, when there were almost 40,000 scans in one day, compared with 500 or so daily last summer. It has dropped back since but there were still around 5,000 a day this week, said Rosenfeldt, who noted ""Made O'Meter"" is used by over 20,000 people in Denmark but also by people in Germany, Spain, Italy, even Venezuela.""It's become much more personal,"" said Rosenfeldt, who spoke of ""losing an ally and a friend.""Trump announced in January he would slap new tariffs on Denmark and seven other European countries that opposed his takeover calls, only to abruptly drop his threats after he said a ""framework"" for a deal over access to mineral-rich Greenland was reached with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte's help. Few details of that agreement have emerged.The U.S. began technical talks in late January to put together an Arctic security deal with Denmark and Greenland, which say sovereignty is not negotiable.Rosenfeldt knows such boycotts won't damage the U.S. economy, but hopes to send a message to supermarkets and encourage greater reliance on European producers.""Maybe we can send a signal and people will listen and we can make a change,"" he added.The protest may be largely symbolic Another Danish app, ""NonUSA,"" topped 100,000 downloads at the beginning of February. One of its creators, 21-year-old Jonas Pipper, said there were over 25,000 downloads Jan. 21, when 526 product scans were performed in a minute at one point. Of the users, some 46,000 are in Denmark and around 10,000 in Germany.""We noticed some users saying they felt like a little bit of the pressure was lifted off them,"" Pipper said. ""They feel like they kind of gained the power back in this situation.""It's questionable whether such apps will have much practical effect.Christina Gravert, an associate professor of economics at the University of Copenhagen, said there are actually few U.S. products on Danish grocery store shelves, ""around 1 to 3%"". Nuts, wines and candy, for example. But there is widespread use of American technology in Denmark, from Apple iPhones to Microsoft Office tools.""If you really want to have an impact, that's where you should start,"" she said.Even ""Made O'Meter"" and ""NonUSA"" are downloaded from Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store.Gravert, who specializes in behavioral economics, said such boycott campaigns are usually short-lived and real change often requires an organized effort rather than individual consumers.""It can be interesting for big supermarket brands to say, OK, we're not going to carry these products anymore because consumers don't want to buy them,"" she said. ""If you think about large companies, this might have some type of impact on the import (they) do.""On a recent morning, shoppers leaving one Copenhagen grocery store were divided.""We do boycott, but we don't know all the American goods. So, it's mostly the well-known trademarks,"" said Morten Nielsen, 68, a retired navy officer. ""It's a personal feeling ... we feel we do something, I know we are not doing very much.""""I love America, I love traveling in America,"" said 63-year-old retiree Charlotte Fuglsang. ""I don't think we should protest that way.""","""Made O'Meter"" uses artificial intelligence to identify and analyze several products at a time, then recommend similar European-made alternatives. The app claims over 95% accuracy. Another Danish app, ""NonUSA,"" topped 100,000 downloads at the beginning of February.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128064177,imgsize-1259189,width-400,resizemode-4/ap-file-photo.jpg"

Failed crackdowns





A man, while surfing his regular channel for adult content, found himself on the website. On screen, he saw the quality time he had spent with his girlfriend in a hotel in China's Shenzhen three weeks ago.This incident sparked an investigation into China's spy-cam porn industry, exposing how the genre, heavily fueled by the voyeuristic audience, has been operating a sophisticated network of hidden cameras, livestreams, and paid subscriptions that exploit hotel guests nationwide.A report by BBC World Service found evidence of a structured industry involving multiple actors, including installers, “camera owners”, agents, and online distributors. The content is promoted on Telegram, a channel banned in China, while higher-level operators reportedly manage camera installations and streaming infrastructure.One of the Telegram channels, managed by an agent named 'AKA' had up to 10,000 members and was promoting access to over 180 hotel-room spy-cams livestreaming intimate moments to paying consumers for fees of around 450 Yuan monthly.Subscribers were able to select from multiple feeds, which are triggered immediately after the hotel guests put their key cards in.The website also had the options to rewind footage, download clips from the archives and a chatroom.In a period of seven months, 54 cameras were identified (half active), potentially capturing thousands of unaware guests based on occupancy rates.Operators install miniature hidden cameras, sometimes as small as a pencil eraser, inside hotel fixtures such as ventilation units, wiring them directly into the building’s power supply. The agents operate as intermediaries for “camera owners”, who are believed to oversee both the physical installation of devices and the running of the online platforms.Platform archives examined in the probe contained more than 6,000 edited clips dating back to 2017, and when one camera in a Zhengzhou hotel was discovered and removed, a replacement feed was activated within hours.Although regulations introduced in April 2025 require hotels to conduct routine inspections for hidden cameras, investigators were still able to identify thousands of newly uploaded videos on six different platforms over an 18‑month period.Law enforcement cases appear scattered across multiple provinces, but experts say the sustained demand for “raw”, non-consensual footage continues to drive the market, and tests show that many commercially available camera detectors fail to identify professionally concealed devices.","Investigation into China's spy-cam porn industry exposes sophisticated network of hidden cameras, livestreams, and paid subscriptions. 54 cameras were identified (half active), potentially capturing thousands of unaware guests based on occupancy rates.

Connecting the Musaffah area with Mohammed bin Zayed City, this road now has a speed limit of 100 km/h, down from 120 km/h previously. Another section of E22 has also seen consistent reductions.

Why the change? Road safety at the core of Abu Dhabi



Abu Dhabi Reduces Speed Limits on Key Roads for Enhanced Safety

Part of a wider traffic safety trend in Abu Dhabi



Abu Dhabi's New Speed Limits: Safer Roads or Just More Fines?

What Abu Dhabi's new speed limits mean for drivers



Adjust Your Driving Habits: Drivers must be aware of the new limits and adjust their speedometers accordingly. Tools like GPS apps may take time to update in real time, so authorities insist motorists follow posted signs rather than defaults on navigation systems.

Drivers must be aware of the new limits and adjust their speedometers accordingly. Tools like apps may take time to update in real time, so authorities insist motorists follow posted signs rather than defaults on navigation systems. Increased Enforcement: With updated limits, radar systems and speed cameras are being retuned, and traffic enforcement units have signalled strict monitoring and penalties for violations. That can include fines and black points, especially in areas where previous patterns showed high violation and crash rates.

With updated limits, radar systems and speed cameras are being retuned, and traffic enforcement units have signalled strict monitoring and penalties for violations. That can include fines and black points, especially in areas where previous patterns showed high violation and crash rates. Safer Roads Ahead (If Compliance Improves): Research in other urban environments shows that moderate speed limits combined with enforcement and driver awareness reduce both fatal and serious collisions (e.g., studies correlating speed reductions to safety outcomes in roadway management literature). While a UAE-specific academic study on speed effects is pending, broader analysis supports this principle in traffic safety planning.





In a bold push to improve road safety and reduce traffic collisions, the Joint Traffic Safety Committee in Abu Dhabi has rolled out new reduced speed limits on three of the emirate’s busiest roads. The updated regulations, which took effect on February 09, 2026, mark the latest in a series of transport reforms designed to curb high-speed accidents and make daily commutes safer for all motorists.Here’s a comprehensive look at what’s changed, why authorities acted and what drivers need to know going forward.Under the new rules, authorities have lowered posted speed limits by 20 km/h on three major road corridors in Abu Dhabi -All reductions apply in both directions and are now enforceable. Motorists have been urged to adhere strictly to the updated limits for their own safety and that of other road users.Authorities say the revisions are part of a broader safety strategy aimed at lowering crash rates and protecting both commuters and vulnerable road users. Abu Dhabi has seen increasing vehicle volumes in recent years and data show that high-speed collisions remain one of the biggest contributors to fatal and serious injury crashes nationally.Earlier variable speed limit systems trialled in Abu Dhabi, which adjust limits in real time based on weather, congestion or accidents, demonstrated that lower speeds correlate with improved safety outcomes and smoother traffic flow during hazardous conditions like fog or peak hours.By standardising lower maximum speeds across key motorways, traffic authorities aim to reduce the stopping distances required at higher speeds, a key factor in both accident severity and frequency.Abu Dhabi’s new speed limits are not isolated. Across the UAE, authorities have been steadily updating road rules to prioritise safety. In October 2025, Abu Dhabi introduced a variable speed limit system on Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Road, using digital signage to lower limits automatically during bad weather, traffic peaks or incident response situations.On other major routes, authorities have previously reduced maximum limits, for example on Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed International Road (E11) and Sweihan Road (E20), to clear safety thresholds. The emirate also abolished a minimum 120 km/h speed requirement on Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Road (E311) to improve safety and traffic harmony.In addition, Abu Dhabi has implemented truck movement restrictions on certain roads to reduce congestion and collision risk during peak hours (e.g., banning truck movement on E11 and E10). Together, these measures position Abu Dhabi as one of the most proactive emirates in the UAE for road safety regulation, blending traditional fixed limits with dynamic and context-sensitive systems.These changes come amid a broader UAE push to reduce road deaths and injuries, a priority for both traffic authorities and policymakers. Previous federal law reforms included stricter penalties for reckless behaviours, including unsafe overtaking and unsafe lane changes, aimed at reducing crash causation factors.Multiple emirates, including Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah, have also adjusted limits on certain urban roads to enhance safety. The message from authorities is clear that the speed management is central to saving lives on the road and static limits alone are not enough without consistent enforcement, driver education and infrastructure adaptation.Given how traffic authorities have rolled out dynamic limit adjustments, truck bans and variable signage, the future of road safety in Abu Dhabi could include expanded real-time speed management systems on more highways and intercity roads, integration of congestion and crash data into planning to fine-tune enforcement and limit calibration and broader road safety campaigns to align public understanding with regulatory goals.Abu Dhabi’s new speed limit reductions on three major roads, trimming limits by 20 km/h, are part of a wider and multi-pronged effort to improve road safety and traffic flow as the emirate’s population and vehicle numbers grow. For drivers, it means adjusting speed habits, understanding variable signage where deployed and staying aware that road safety regulations are evolving rapidly, not just locally but across the UAE, to match modern mobility challenges.",Authorities have lowered posted speed limits by 20 km/h on three major road corridors in Abu Dhabi. All reductions apply in both directions and are now enforceable. Motorists have been urged to adhere strictly to the updated limits for their own safety and that of other road users.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128155730,imgsize-52874,width-400,resizemode-4/fines-incoming-abu-dhabis-speed-limit-shake-up-explained.jpg"

A souvenir designed like a world tour





How it works and where to get it





What it is not





Why it has become so popular









At first glance, it looks like a real passport. In reality, the Dubai’s Global Village passport is a playful souvenir that turns a night out into a miniature journey around the world. Sold inside Global Village, the booklet has become a favourite among families, children, and anyone who enjoys collecting memories rather than magnets.So what exactly is it, and why do so many visitors make it part of their visit?The Global Village passport is a small, themed booklet created as a keepsake for guests exploring the park’s more than 30 international pavilions. Each pavilion represents a different country or region, and each has its own custom stamp. As visitors move from one pavilion to the next, they can add a stamp to their booklet, slowly filling the pages with colourful impressions.The idea is simple. Walk, explore, stamp, repeat. By the end of the visit, the passport becomes a personal record of how many cultures you have “visited” in one evening.The passport is priced at around AED 10 and is usually available at ticket counters or information desks near the entrance.Once inside, guests carry it with them and use stamp stations or machines located at participating pavilions. Countries such as India, Turkey and African pavilions are among those typically featured, with one stamp per pavilion.With roughly 30 pavilions each season, completing the entire booklet is seen as a small achievement, especially for younger visitors.Despite its name and design, the Global Village passport has no official or legal use. It is not a travel document, entry ticket, or visa substitute. Visitors still need a regular Global Village entry ticket, which usually starts at around AED 25 when purchased online.In previous seasons, there was a separate promotional activity involving real passports and free entry stamps, but that campaign is not connected to the souvenir booklet.For many visitors, the appeal lies in its simplicity. It adds a game-like challenge to the visit, encourages exploration of every pavilion, and serves as a lightweight, affordable keepsake. More than anything, it captures the spirit of Global Village by turning one evening into a journey across cultures, neatly stamped page by page.","Dubai's Global Village passport lets visitors collect pavilion stamps.

Looking ahead: Education and sustainable growth through Al Dhaid Wildlife Museum







In a significant cultural and educational milestone for the UAE’s central region, his highness Sheikh Dr Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah, inaugurated the Al Dhaid Wildlife Museum in Al Dhaid City, reinforcing the emirate’s long-term vision for environmental stewardship and public engagement with nature.Officially opened adjacent to the historic Souq Sharia’t Al Dhaid, the museum represents a qualitative addition to Sharjah’s growing network of educational and conservation-focused destinations. Its launch follows a broader transformation of Al Dhaid into a multi-faceted region where heritage, nature and community life intersect.The Wildlife Museum has been intentionally designed as an interactive and educational platform that invites families, students, researchers and nature enthusiasts to explore the rich biodiversity and ecological dynamics of the Arabian desert landscape.Spanning several specialised halls, exhibits cover a wide range of natural topics, from desert animal adaptations and plant life to geological formations and seasonal cycles. One notable feature includes a three-dimensional model of desert fauna anatomy, designed to deepen visitors’ understanding of how species thrive in harsh environments.By deploying advanced digital technologies and interactive learning tools, the museum aims to make environmental science accessible and engaging.This aligns with an emerging trend across the Gulf of blending technology with natural history to attract younger audiences and bolster public science literacy.During the inauguration speech, the Ruler emphasised the importance of sustained scientific work to preserve local ecosystems and wildlife, reaffirming Sharjah’s ongoing commitment to conservation efforts. These efforts extend beyond museum walls. For example, long-term projects such as seed collection and storage initiatives, including multi-million seed banks, reflect broader strategies to protect plant diversity and support scientific research.By featuring educational laboratories and dedicated spaces for research within the museum, the institution is positioned not only as a destination for visitors, but as a learning hub for scholars and environmental professionals. It supports initiatives that promote ecological understanding and sustainable development, which are values increasingly central to national agendas across the UAE.Spanning 2,755 square metres, the museum is thoughtfully designed with a series of specialised halls that explore the Arabian desert’s unique environment, the ways life adapts to its challenging conditions, and the rich biodiversity of plant and animal species that thrive within it.The museum’s main entrance reflects traditional Emirati architecture of the central region, featuring an arched gateway reminiscent of historic forts and heritage buildings. This design serves as a symbolic passage into a space dedicated to culture, knowledge, and environmental awareness.The earth-toned façade blends seamlessly with the surrounding desert landscape, while the hand-carved wooden gate, adorned with Islamic-inspired motifs, adds a sense of craftsmanship and authenticity. Together, these elements present a contemporary architectural expression rooted in Emirati identity and memory of place.Supporting its scientific and educational mission, the museum is equipped with a comprehensive range of facilities. These include administrative offices, dedicated spaces for scientific researchers, a fully equipped laboratory and a technical support department. Additional facilities include offices for environmental education, a programmes and activities department, a guidance unit and visitor services such as parking and support amenities.The opening of the Wildlife Museum forms part of a larger effort to reposition Al Dhaid as a destination that celebrates both its natural environment and its historical roots. Alongside the museum, restorations and new attractions are enhancing the region’s cultural circuit, bringing heritage tourism into harmony with environmental exploration.This initiative runs parallel to the restoration of historic structures and marketplaces, which collectively offer a layered visitor experience, from traditional architecture and souq culture to immersive encounters with nature. Such developments support wider sustainability narratives in the UAE, where environmental conservation, cultural preservation and community engagement are increasingly integrated into urban and regional planning.The Al Dhaid Wildlife Museum highlights how cultural institutions are evolving to serve multiple roles as centres for public education, platforms for scientific collaboration and anchors for tourism development. By promoting ecological awareness through interactive experiences and scientific engagement, the museum not only reflects Sharjah’s heritage but helps shape a future generation of environmentally conscious citizens.As the museum opens its doors, it stands as a testament to how investments in environmental education can deepen public appreciation of nature while advancing broader cultural and developmental goals across the UAE.","Al Dhaid Wildlife Museum is a hub for interactive environmental learning in Sharjah. It offers an engaging educational experience that highlights the rich biodiversity of Sharjah’s natural environments. Exhibits include a traditional Bedouin tent, symbolising desert heritage, alongside displays explaining how ancient communities determined seasons.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128101870,imgsize-34352,width-400,resizemode-4/sharjah39s-al-dhaid-wildlife-museum-a-game-changer-for-environmental-education-in-the-uae.jpg"

Why fragrance matters more during Ramadan in the Gulf



Ramadan's Secret Weapon: How Gulf Men Are Using Scent to Make a Statement in 2026





As Ramadan 2026 settles in, scent is once again taking centre stage across the Gulf. Far beyond a grooming afterthought, fragrance during the holy month is a quiet marker of identity and are worn for evening prayers, family iftars and the social rhythms that lead into Eid. This year’s Arabic cologne trends reflect a deeper return to heritage notes, layered with modern sensibilities and long-lasting compositions designed for reflective nights and festive gatherings.Deep, smoky woods continue to dominate Ramadan fragrance preferences. Oud-inspired compositions that are rich, resinous and unapologetically bold, remain a cultural staple, particularly for evening wear. These scents often unfold slowly, starting dense and powerful before settling into warm, grounding bases that linger for hours.For many men, woody fragrances feel intrinsically tied to Ramadan nights as they are dignified, spiritual and deeply comforting. Their longevity makes them ideal for long taraweeh prayers and extended family gatherings, where subtle presence matters more than projection.Amber-forward fragrances are seeing renewed popularity this season, prized for their soft warmth and enveloping character. These colognes often blend sweet resins with balsamic undertones, creating a scent profile that feels intimate rather than overpowering.Perfect for Ramadan evenings, amber scents evoke a sense of calm and contemplation, aligning naturally with the month’s reflective mood. They are especially favoured by men who want something rich yet restrained, offering depth without heaviness.For those who prefer their fragrance to make a statement, spicy oriental profiles are trending strongly in 2026. Think warm spices layered over dark woods and subtle sweetness as fragrances that feel celebratory and confident.These colognes are often chosen for post-iftar socialising and Eid gatherings, where boldness feels appropriate. The spice notes add energy, while the oriental base ensures the scent remains grounded and culturally resonant.A newer category gaining traction blends freshness with traditional depth. These fragrances typically open with citrus or aromatic notes before transitioning into woody or musky bases. The result is a cleaner, lighter take on Arabic perfumery, which is ideal for daytime fasting hours or warmer evenings.This hybrid style appeals to younger wearers and those seeking versatility: fragrances that move seamlessly from mosque visits to casual gatherings without feeling too heavy.Musk-based colognes, often paired with soft leather nuances, are emerging as understated favourites this Ramadan. These scents sit closer to the skin, offering a personal rather than performative presence.Favoured for their elegance and restraint, musky profiles align well with the quieter, inward focus of the holy month. They are particularly popular among men who prefer a refined signature scent that does not announce itself loudly but leaves a lasting impression.Across categories, one theme is clear: performance and emotional resonance matter more than novelty. Men are gravitating towards scents that last through long evenings, feel appropriate for spiritual settings and carry a sense of cultural familiarity.In Ramadan 2026, Arabic colognes are less about chasing trends and more about honouring moments, from silent prayers to joyful Eid embraces. Whether woody, spicy, amber-rich or softly musky, the season’s fragrances reflect a balance of devotion, tradition and modern personal style.","Scent is a quiet marker of identity and worn for evening prayers, family iftars and the social rhythms that lead into Eid.

Shahi Tharoor’s thoughts on reading, children and AI





Dubai’s vibrant literary scene was abuzz recently as Shashi Tharoor , Indian politician, author and former diplomat, delivered a memorable session at the Emirates Literature Festival, one of the Middle East’s premier cultural events celebrating books, ideas and global literary voices. Held annually under the patronage of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and organised by the Emirates Literature Foundation, the festival draws hundreds of speakers and thousands of readers from around the world.The 2026 edition featured more than 200 speakers from over 40 countries, bringing a mix of fiction, non-fiction, Arabic literature, poetry, performance and discussion to Dubai audiences.Tharoor’s session, titled A Wonderland of Words, also the name of his latest book, quickly became a highlight of the festival. Unlike typical lectures, his appearance blended humour, personal anecdotes and linguistic insight in a talk that felt more like an intimate conversation than a formal presentation.Moderated by British presenter Amandeep Bhangu, the session focused on how language shapes thought, culture and connection, drawing laughter and reflection in equal measure. Tharoor described his book as a series of short, reflective bursts rather than dense arguments, “bite-sized chapters, ideal for dipping in and out”, a format that felt like a quiet validation of modern reading habits.However, the real charm of the session lay in how effortlessly he braided the personal with the public, tracing his lifelong love of language back to his father, who taught himself English through persistence and curiosity rather than polish. Arriving in London and recognising the limits of his learning, his father began filling notebooks with quotations from Byron, Shakespeare and Dickens, not to impress but out of sheer delight in words.He revealed that back home, language was treated like a game: Scrabble before it was fashionable, word-building challenges where Tharoor admitted he “usually won” and even a homemade, pre-digital precursor to Wordle that allowed 20 guesses and offered no clues. Yet beneath the playfulness of his father was emotional precision, a man who wrote letters so moving that people remembered them long after his passing, whether for moments of grief, joy or setback.From him, Tharoor learned that words are not decorative flourishes but exact instruments, a pleasure in themselves and powerful because of what they can carry.Tharoor traced his fascination with language to his father’s passionate approach to English, recalling how notebooks full of quotations and impromptu wordplay games shaped his early years. “You don’t really choose a language, a language chooses you through the circumstances of your life,” he told the audience, capturing the personal, almost serendipitous nature of linguistic affinity.He also tackled the stereotype of his own “difficult vocabulary,” underscoring that words should serve clarity and connection, not confusion. “I unfortunately have an undeserved reputation for difficult words. I use the most appropriate words for what I’m trying to convey. If I can’t convey my thoughts to the audience, I’m a poor communicator. I use language to get my message across, not to confuse or impress,” he said to applause.Tharoor’s playful side surfaced in anecdotes about English eccentricities, like explanations of humorous linguistic terms and the cultural quirks of borrowing words across languages. Dubai, a global crossroads where multilingual communication is part of daily life, provided a fitting backdrop for Tharoor’s reflections on language and identity.His remarks on how English interacts with other languages and cultural contexts resonated with an audience intimately familiar with linguistic blending across communities. Quoting Nelson Mandela’s famous insight that speaking in someone’s language reaches the mind, while speaking in their own language reaches the heart, Tharoor highlighted the emotional power embedded in words and communication.In a Q&A segment, Tharoor urged parents and readers to model lifelong reading for children, asking whether they read themselves before encouraging others to read. He also warned against over-reliance on artificial intelligence in writing, stressing that outsourcing thought can dilute individuality and creative voice.Tharoor’s session exemplified the broader ethos of the Emirates Literature Festival, a belief in the transformative power of books and discussion to spur curiosity, understanding and cross-cultural exchange. Each year, the festival brings a mix of authors, thinkers and artists to Dubai, offering everything from panels and workshops to performances and interactive discussions. Its inclusive programming has helped position the city as a major cultural hub in the region.Tharoor’s appearance in Dubai was more than a book talk; it was a reminder of language’s enduring influence in an era dominated by rapid communication, digital media and global diversity. In blending personal narrative, linguistic curiosity and cultural observation, he offered the audience both entertainment and reflection. These are the qualities that make literature festivals more than mere gatherings but platforms for collective imagination and dialogue.","Shashi Tharoor is an Indian politician, author and former diplomat.

Buying luxury property in Dubai just got easier: How buyers can win big in market of high-end homes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/buying-luxury-property-in-dubai-just-got-easier-how-buyers-can-win-big-in-market-of-high-end-homes/articleshow/128065061.cms,"Dubai’s Luxury Property Market Is Crowded: Here’s How Smart Buyers Are Still Winning Big

Million-Dirham Decisions Made Simple: The Tool Luxury Buyers in Dubai Are Quietly Using

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Dubai’s ultra-luxury property segment, including homes priced above Dh20 million, remains one of the hottest real estate markets globally, drawing affluent local and international investors alike. However, while listing volumes are high, identifying the right inventory with real market value and credibility can still be challenging.With hundreds of luxury transactions recorded annually, including more than 750 properties above Dh50m and over 250 valued above Dh100m in 2025 alone, the challenge for affluent buyers is not just seeing inventory but identifying the right opportunities backed by real market behaviour. Platforms like Bayut are simplifying this process with data-led tools, verified listings and specialist agent networks designed to empower discerning buyers.Instead of simply providing endless listings, Bayut focuses on three core pillars of data insights, verified availability and expert partnerships to help buyers separate signal from noise in a dynamic market environment.One of the biggest challenges for luxury buyers is knowing whether a listed price reflects actual market activity rather than wishful thinking.Bayut tackles this by offering transaction-backed insights, drawing on official Dubai Land Department (DLD) records, so that buyers can see what similar properties are really achieving in terms of sales volume and pricing.In 2025, Dubai recorded thousands of high-value property sales, including more than 750 transactions for properties above Dh50 million and over 250 above Dh100 million, underscoring both demand and the need for accurate context. This type of benchmark pricing helps buyers understand if a property is competitively priced, overpriced, or a rare value play — a crucial step before making multi-million-dirham commitments.Luxury real estate is not just about price tags, it is about deep market knowledge, negotiation experience and access to exclusive opportunities. Bayut’s ecosystem highlights specialist agents with proven track records in high-value transactions, rather than generalists who may be active across all segments.Programs like TruBroker, Bayut’s quality standard for agent credibility, help buyers identify intermediaries who are consistent, data-savvy and focused on premium markets. This makes it easier to form partnerships with professionals who understand how to position offers, anticipate buyer preferences and secure coveted properties.Luxury inventory, especially at the very top end, can be distorted by outdated listings, duplicate posts or units that are no longer available. Bayut’s technology emphasises verified listings through tools like TruCheck and cross-referencing with systems like DLD’s Madmoun to ensure that a property you’re considering is truly active and not a relic of old marketing efforts.This verification helps buyers avoid wasted time and misaligned expectations, accelerating decision-making and reducing friction in negotiations.Luxury buyers also benefit from tools that help them evaluate whether asking prices make sense relative to market benchmarks. Bayut’s TruEstimate offers valuation estimates, historical price movement analysis and demand indicators that serve as a sense check for where a property stands, helping buyers discern possible overpricing or hidden opportunity without removing the emotional appeal of design or location.Such analytical signals are especially valuable in a segment where architectural uniqueness or waterfront views can command premium pricing that may not be immediately intuitive.High-end property purchases often emerge from long-term observation rather than last-minute decisions. Features like portfolio tracking (where buyers can keep an eye on pricing trends, status shifts and comparisons across multiple shortlisted properties), give investors a structured way to monitor the market over time, rather than making impulsive choices.This kind of forward-looking visibility keeps serious buyers informed about pricing shifts, new inventory that enters the high-end space, and when timing might be right to make a move. As Dubai continues to attract wealthy buyers from Europe, Asia and the Gulf with significant activity in places like Palm Jumeirah, Dubai Hills Estate and Mohammed Bin Rashid City, the need for clarity and confidence in property selection has never been greater.Bayut’s combination of transaction-backed data, verification, specialist networks and valuation insights positions it not just as a listing portal but as a trusted guide through one of the world’s most dynamic luxury markets. In an era where information overload can mislead as easily as it informs, access to accurate data, specialised expertise and transparent tools helps buyers make smarter and more efficient decisions, whether they are picking a trophy asset or a strategic long-term investment.","Dubai’s ultra-luxury property segment, including homes priced above Dh20 million, remains one of the hottest real estate markets globally.

Lucy Letby Netflix documentary: Why UK baby-killer nurse’s parents call it ‘invasion of privacy’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/lucy-letby-netflix-documentary-why-uk-baby-killer-nurses-parents-call-it-invasion-of-privacy-explained/articleshow/127847789.cms,"‘We will not watch it’: Parents condemn documentary

Use of family home footage sparks privacy concerns

Questions Raised Over Police Cooperation

Who Is Lucy Letby?





A new Netflix documentary on convicted British neonatal nurse Lucy Letby has sparked fresh controversy in the UK, with her parents accusing the streaming giant of a “complete invasion of privacy” for allegedly using footage of their family home without consent.The Investigation of Lucy Letby, set to stream from February 4 on Netflix, promises viewers “unseen footage and unheard insider accounts” from one of Britain’s most disturbing criminal cases.However, even before its release, the series has drawn criticism from Letby’s family, reopening debates around ethics, victimhood and privacy in true-crime storytelling.Lucy Letby’s parents, Susan and John Letby, have said they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.In a statement to The Guardian, the couple said previous media coverage, including televised images of their daughter being led away in handcuffs, had already been “heartbreaking,” but claimed the Netflix production crossed a new line.“This documentary is on another level,” they said. “We will not watch it. It would likely kill us if we did.”A major point of contention for the Letbys is the alleged inclusion of footage filmed inside or around their long-time family home, without their knowledge.The couple said they were unaware that the documentary would feature images of the house where they have lived for more than 40 years, located in a small town where, they say, “everyone knows everyone.”They also criticised a clip shown in the documentary’s trailer, which reportedly depicts Lucy Letby being arrested in her bedroom and saying goodbye to one of her cats.“All this taking place in the home where we have lived for decades,” they said, calling it “a complete invasion of privacy.”The parents further questioned why an investigating officer involved in the case was permitted to discuss or show what occurred inside their home on the day of Letby’s arrest.“We always cooperated fully,” they said, asking why Netflix and the production company did not inform them before using such material.Netflix and ITN Productions, which produced the documentary, have not publicly responded to these claims.Lucy Letby, born 4 January 1990, is a former neonatal nurse who worked at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England. She came under suspicion after an unusually high number of infant deaths occurred in the neonatal unit between June 2015 and June 2016.After a lengthy investigation, Letby was charged in November 2020 with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder involving newborn babies.In August 2023, she was convicted of seven counts of murder and seven counts of attempted murder.She received a whole-life prison sentence, meaning she will never be eligible for release. In July 2024, she was also found guilty in a retrial of an attempted murder charge on which the jury had previously failed to reach a verdict.Letby is currently incarcerated at HMP Low Newton in Durham.","Lucy Letby’s parents say they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets. The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away. To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125131123,imgsize-132093,width-400,resizemode-4/enigmatic-legal-inquiry.jpg"

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

OpenAI's top researcher Zoe Hitzig has quit. Announcing her resignation on X, formerly Twitter, Hitzig said, ""I resigned from OpenAI on Monday. The same day, they started testing ads in ChatGPT. OpenAI has the most detailed record of private human thought ever assembled. Can we trust them to resist the tidal forces pushing them to abuse it? I wrote about better options for @nytopinion."" Her opinion piece in New York Times is titled, 'OpenAI Is Making the Mistakes Facebook Made. I Quit.'Zoe Hitzig is a Research Scientist at OpenAI and a Junior Fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows. She received my PhD in economics from Harvard in the year 2023. She holds an M.Phil from the University of Cambridge. ""This week, OpenAI started testing ads on ChatGPT. I also resigned from the company after spending two years as a researcher helping to shape how A.I. models were built and priced, and guiding early safety policies before standards were set in stone,"" is how Hitzig starts her Oped.Hitzig is visibly unhappy with ChatGPT showing ads to its free users. She says though she believes that ads are not immoral or unethical as AI is expensive to run, but she has deep reservations about OpenAI’s strategy.The reason, according to her, is: ""For several years, ChatGPT users have generated an archive of human candor that has no precedent, in part because people believed they were talking to something that had no ulterior agenda. Users are interacting with an adaptive, conversational voice to which they have revealed their most private thoughts. People tell chatbots about their medical fears, their relationship problems, their beliefs about God and the afterlife. Advertising built on that archive creates a potential for manipulating users in ways we don’t have the tools to understand, let alone prevent.""She says that though OpenAI claims that it will adhere to principles for running ads on ChatGPT, she is ""worried subsequent iterations won’t, because the company is building an economic engine that creates strong incentives to override its own rules."" She adds that the erosion of OpenAI’s own principles to maximize engagement may already be underway. ""It’s against company principles to optimize user engagement solely to generate more advertising revenue, but it has been reported that the company already optimizes for daily active users anyway, likely by encouraging the model to be more flattering and sycophantic. This optimization can make users feel more dependent on A.I. for support in their lives. We’ve seen the consequences of dependence, including psychiatrists documenting instances of “chatbot psychosis” and allegations that ChatGPT reinforced suicidal ideation in some users,"" wrote Hitzig.Comparing OpenAI to Facebook, she write, ""In its early years, Facebook promised that users would control their data and be able to vote on policy changes. Those commitments eroded. The company eliminated holding public votes on policy. Privacy changes marketed as giving users more control over their data were found by the Federal Trade Commission to have done the opposite, and in fact made private information public. All of this happened gradually under pressure from an advertising model that rewarded engagement above all else.""In her opinion piece, Hitzig also gives three options/approaches that she says can be used by AI companies to help potentially stop them from manipulating consumers.* One approach is explicit cross subsidies — using profits from one service or customer base to offset losses from another.* A second option is to accept advertising but pair it with real governance — not a blog post of principles, but a binding structure with independent oversight over how personal data is used.* A third approach involves putting users’ data under independent control through a trust or cooperative with a legal duty to act in users’ interests.In conclusion, she writes, ""None of these options are easy. But we still have time to work them out to avoid the two outcomes I fear most: a technology that manipulates the people who use it at no cost, and one that exclusively benefits the few who can afford to use it.""","Zoe Hitzig is a Research Scientist at OpenAI and a Junior Fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows.

Google-owned YouTube doesn’t consider itself a social media service and claims it isn't addictive. This argument came during the second day of opening statements in a social media addiction trial in the US. The company's lawyers said YouTube is an entertainment platform, more like Netflix than a social network like Facebook, with people using the video streaming app to learn how to cook, knit, and become pop stars rather than endlessly scrolling. While talking about the app's video recommendation algorithm during the trial, Luis Li, YouTube's lawyer, contended,In this case, a 20-year-old California woman identified as K.G.M. has accused YouTube and Meta's Instagram of creating addictive apps that harmed mental health. The trial, in the California Superior Court of Los Angeles, is the first in a series against Meta, Snap, TikTok and YouTube, testing whether social media use can lead to addiction comparable to slot machines at casinos and cigarettes.Teenagers, school districts and states have filed thousands of lawsuits against the tech companies, accusing them of designing their platforms to encourage excessive use. The social media companies have argued that there is no scientific evidence proving that their platforms cause addiction and have pointed to a federal law that protects them from liability for what their users post online. A win by the plaintiff could open the door to monetary damages in similar lawsuits, and judges could order the companies to change their app designs.YouTube CEO Neal Mohan, Facebook parent Meta’s chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, and Instagram head Adam Mosseri are among the executives expected to testify in the trial.In his opening statements, Mark Lanier, the plaintiff KGM's attorney, claimed that internal documents from YouTube's parent company, Google, referred to features as “He also pointed to Meta documents showing employees had twice said its methods reminded them of those of tobacco companies.He said KGM's case wasNYT reported.YouTube's lawyer Li challenged that the video streaming site was not designed for infinite scrolling.

Oracle’s risky AI bet

Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison has now seen an unprecedented $50 billion wiped off his net worth in less than forty days this year, as per Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Ellison’s fortune stood at $199 billion by Wednesday’s (February 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of January. A single-day slump of 5% in Oracle’s stock erased about $9 billion from this wealth, deepening the decline.The round in software stocks was triggered by Anthropic’s release of plugins for its Claude Cowork AI agent, which can easily automate corporate tasks in legal, scales, finance, marketing and data analysis. Investors now fear that such tools could lead to reduction in the demand for external software from established giants such as Adobe, Salesforce, Intuit and Atlassian. Shares of all these companies tumbled earlier this week before staging a particle rebound, but Oracle’s loses remained steep.Ellison was not along in facing the sharp decline in net worth. Along with him, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also saw his net worth fall by around $11 billion, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg lost around $8 billion. On the other hand, other tech leaders like Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Jeff Bezos and Jensen Huang each shed around $5 billion as the stocks of the companies dropped by at least 2%.For those unaware, Oracle has aggressively positioned itself as an important player in the AI boom, the company has signed deals with Nvidia and OpenAI in order to offer data centers powering next-generation technology. However, its heavy spending and increasing debt have raised concerns among analysts. The company’s remaining performance obligations — contracted sales not yet recognized as revenue — surged 438% year-over-year to $523 billion as of November 30, nearly ten times its annual revenue of $53 billion.Critics believe that Oracle may be overspending. Popular American investor Michael Burry has publicly bet against Oracle. Burry has warned that the company’s debt-fueled expansion tied to AI contracts was unnecessary, calling the moves “hard to explain” and suggesting that “ego” might be driving decisions.","Ellison's fortune stood at $199 billion by Wednesday’s (February 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of January.

Why Microsoft needs a quality czar right now

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre. Charlie Bell, who led the company's security operations since 2021, is stepping down from that role to become what's effectively an engineering quality czar—reporting directly to Nadella.""Charlie and I have been planning this transition for some time, given his desire to move from being an org leader to being an IC engineer,"" Nadella wrote in an internal memo shared on Wednesday. ""And I love how energized he is to practice this craft here day in and day out!""Bell's replacement? Hayete Gallot, who's returning to Microsoft after an 18-month stint as Google Cloud's President of Customer Experience. She previously spent over 15 years at Redmond, climbing to the rank of corporate vice president across Windows, Office, and security teams.The shift is significant. Bell oversaw a team of roughly 10,000 people and was the driving force behind Microsoft's Secure Future Initiative—a company-wide push launched after Chinese hackers breached US government email accounts through a Microsoft Cloud exploit in 2023. That incident triggered a scathing review from the Department of Homeland Security, which called Microsoft's security culture ""inadequate.Now, Bell will work closely with cloud and AI chief Scott Guthrie and Mala Anand on what Nadella calls the ""Quality Excellence Initiative."" The initiative is aimed at delivering ""durable, high-quality experiences at global scale""—corporate speak that likely translates to fewer Azure outages, fewer broken Windows patches, and fewer out-of-band emergency fixes.Gallot's appointment signals a shift in how Microsoft thinks about its security business. Nadella specifically highlighted her ability to combine ""product building with value realization for customers."" She'll also oversee Ales Holecek, who takes on a newly created Chief Architect for Security role.The timing isn't random. During last week's earnings call, Nadella talked up momentum in security products like Security Copilot agents and Purview. The company clearly wants someone who can sell security as aggressively as they build it.Nadella's memo doesn't spell out exactly why engineering quality needs its own dedicated leader at this moment. But the clues aren't hard to find. Microsoft now uses AI to write around 30 percent of its own code, Azure outages remain a recurring headache, and Copilot adoption sits at a modest 3.3 percent among Microsoft 365 users. Bell's got his work cut out.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre.

Meet Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei: Former OpenAI researcher who turned his AI vision into a $3.7 billion company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meet-anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-former-openai-researcher-who-turned-his-ai-vision-into-a-3-7-billion-company/articleshow/127943143.cms,"Source: Bloomberg

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s academic background and early career path



Dario Amodei’s rise at OpenAI and the birth of GPT models



Dario Amodei leaves OpenAI and builds Anthropic



Dario Amodei’s cautious leadership style



Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now. He is not a loud public figure, and he rarely chases attention, but his work has quietly shaped how modern AI systems are built and controlled. Before running a multi-billion-dollar company, Amodei spent years in labs and research roles, studying complex systems and how they behave under pressure. That background still shows in how he talks about artificial intelligence today. While others focus on speed and scale, he appears more concerned with safety, limits, and long-term risks. As AI moves faster than regulation, Amodei’s cautious approach is becoming harder to ignore.Before AI became the world’s favourite buzzword, Amodei was deep in academia. He studied physics at Stanford University and later earned a PhD in biophysics from Princeton. At the time, he was focused on understanding complex biological systems. Cells. Signals. Patterns that emerge rather than being designed. Looking back, that mindset fits AI almost too well.After completing his doctorate, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine.There was no clear path to becoming a tech billionaire. That part came later. Almost accidentally, it seems. Amodei eventually moved into machine learning research, joining companies like Baidu and Google Brain. At Google, he worked on neural networks and AI safety.Colleagues from that period say he already seemed concerned about failure modes. In 2016, he joined OpenAI. Things moved fast after that.At OpenAI, Amodei rose quickly. By 2019, he was Vice President of Research, helping set the organisation’s overall research direction. He led work on GPT-2 and GPT-3, models that changed public perception of AI almost overnight.These systems could write essays, answer questions, and even mimic conversation. Sometimes convincingly. Sometimes awkwardly. During this time, Amodei also co-invented reinforcement learning from human feedback. RLHF sounds technical, but the idea is simple. Teach AI systems by showing them what humans actually prefer, not just what scores well mathematically.In 2021, Amodei left OpenAI along with six others, including his sister Daniela Amodei. They founded Anthropic. Some people were sceptical at first. But Anthropic took a different route. It became a public benefit corporation. That detail mattered. It signalled that profit would not be the only priority. At least in theory. Their AI model, Claude, leaned into being cautious. Less dramatic. More restrained. That tone appealed to companies worried about reputational risk.By September 2025, Anthropic was reportedly valued at $183 billion by private investors. That number raised eyebrows. Especially for a company without much public hype.Partnerships with Alphabet and Amazon helped fuel that growth. So did rising concerns about AI safety across governments and corporations. As Anthropic’s valuation climbed, so did Amodei’s wealth. His real-time net worth now sits around $3.7 billion, ranking among the world’s richest people.Amodei does not sound like most tech CEOs. He hedges. A lot. “It seems.” “It might.” “We’re not fully sure yet.” That language annoys some people. Others trust it more. He avoids grand predictions. No promises of utopia. No claims that AI will solve everything.Experts say his influence shows up in quieter ways. Safety research is becoming mainstream. Alignment discussions moving from fringe to boardroom. Competitors are copying ideas they once ignored. No one really knows what comes next for Dario Amodei. AI is moving fast. Faster than regulation.","Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now.

Roblox faces a government ban in Egypt: Here’s why



What this ban means for kids and parents



Roblox going dark in Egypt, the platform that lives almost entirely on screens, the sudden loss felt very real. With games loading, Avatars running around blocky worlds. And then Egypt has officially banned Roblox, saying the move is about protecting children from harmful online content. The story underneath feels layered, political, and a little messy. Roblox looks harmless on the surface but experts say the risk is not the visuals but the interaction. The platform allows users to create games, chat with strangers, and move freely between user-generated worlds.A spokesperson confirmed the company has reached out to Egyptian authorities, offering dialogue to resolve the issue and restore access. The company says it has worked with regulators in other regions to build localised safety systems that align with cultural values. Last year, the company restricted some features across parts of the Middle East to address safety concerns. This ban did not come out of nowhere. Roblox has already been blocked or restricted in countries like Qatar and Turkey with other nations watching closely.The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.According to state-run media, the ban will be coordinated with the National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority. That means internet providers are expected to block access nationwide with no single official explanation was released at first. Later, state outlets pointed to growing concerns about children’s exposure to inappropriate content, online interactions, and psychological risks as reported by Bloomberg. An Egyptian senator had already called for regulating Roblox to protect children’s moral and educational values.President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi recently called for limits on children’s phone use, pointing to similar moves abroad. Australia has banned social media for certain age groups. France is moving in the same direction. Egypt’s parliament is now discussing broader rules for digital platforms including unified age classifications, stronger verification, penalties and possibly forcing companies to have local representatives inside the country.For children, the ban feels abrupt and confusing. For parents, reactions are mixed. Some welcome the move, while others worry it pushes kids toward less visible, less regulated platforms, potentially exposing them to more risks. That is the irony experts often point out. When one door closes, another usually opens. Sometimes darker, more unpredictable, and harder to monitor.Still, supporters of the ban argue that Roblox’s scale makes it different. Millions of users. Constant interaction. Endless content that cannot realistically be watched, moderated, or controlled by humans alone, leaving significant safety and privacy concerns for young players and families.","The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.

What is Phishing: How to spot and stop this common online fraud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-is-phishing-how-to-spot-and-stop-this-common-online-fraud/articleshow/128220101.cms,"What is Phishing

Free phone or empty Bank Account: New scam alert

What is phishing and how it works

Different types of phishing attacks

Email phishing: This is the most common type. Attackers send bulk emails pretending to be banks, social media companies, tax authorities or online retailers. The goal is to trick recipients into clicking a fake link.

Spear phishing: Spear phishing targets specific individuals or organisations. Instead of a general message, attackers personalise the email using the victim’s name, job title or company details. According to IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report, targeted phishing attacks are a leading cause of corporate security incidents.

Smishing: Smishing is phishing conducted through SMS messages. In India, fraudulent text messages often claim that a bank account will be frozen unless a link is clicked. CERT-In has warned users about such mobile-based scams.

Vishing: Vishing involves phone calls. Attackers pretend to be customer care agents, tax officials or law enforcement officers. They may ask for one-time passwords or banking details. Banking authorities have repeatedly warned that banks never ask for OTPs over phone calls.

Clone phishing: In clone phishing, a legitimate email is copied and resent with a malicious link replacing the original attachment or link. Because the email appears familiar, victims are more likely to trust it.

Why phishing works

Warning signs of a phishing attacks

You should be suspicious of requests for personal information that come out of the blue. Real banks and government agencies will never ask you for your password or OTP through email or text message.

Generic greetings, like ""Dear Customer"" instead of a specific name, can be a sign of a lot of phishing attempts.

It's common for domain names to be spelled wrong. A fake website, for instance, might change a letter in the domain name to make it look like the real one.

Bad grammar or strange wording could be a sign of fraud, but modern phishing attempts are getting better.

People who want to stop victims from thinking clearly often use urgent threats that require immediate action.

How to protect yourself from phishing

Don't click on links that look suspicious. If you get an email that looks like it's from your bank, don't click on the link. Instead, open the official banking app or type the website address into your browser.

Whenever you can, turn on two-factor authentication. Even if a password is stolen, the second verification step can prevent unauthorised access.

Keep software updated. Security updates patch vulnerabilities that attackers exploit.

Use filters for spam. Most email services automatically filter out messages that look suspicious.

Educate family members. Elderly users and teenagers are often targeted due to a lack of awareness.

Report phishing attempts.

How organisations can reduce phishing risk

Training employees is very important. Regular training sessions help employees spot emails that look suspicious.

Using email authentication standards can help cut down on fake emails. These technical steps check that the sender is who they say they are.

You can find malicious activity early by using endpoint security software and intrusion detection systems.

If credentials are stolen, limiting administrative access makes it less likely that damage will be done.

The internet has changed how people work, shop, bank and stay in touch. Bills are paid online. Salaries are credited digitally. Government services are accessed through apps. Emails carry office documents. Social media connects families across continents. But along with convenience has come risk. Cybercrime has grown steadily over the past decade, and one of the most common methods used by criminals is ‘phishing’.Phishing is not a new threat. It has existed since the early days of email. Yet it continues to succeed because it does not rely on complex hacking tools. Instead, it targets human behaviour. It uses fear, curiosity, trust, or a sense of urgency. A fake link can show passwords, bank account numbers, or personal information with just one click.You need to know what phishing is now. It is a basic skill for living in the digital age. This article talks about what phishing is, how it works, the different types, real-world examples, warning signs, and how people and businesses can protect themselves.Phishing is a type of cybercrime in which criminals pretend to be someone or something trustworthy in order to get people to give them private information.This information could be passwords, credit card numbers, bank account numbers, Aadhaar numbers, one-time passwords, login information, or other private information.Phishing comes from the word ""fishing."" Attackers send out a lot of emails, texts, or fake websites in the hopes that someone will fall for their trap. Phishing doesn't steal information directly through technical breaches; instead, it tricks people into giving it away.Phishing attacks usually involve fake messages that look like they come from reliable sources. These messages are meant to steal information or put harmful software on your computer.Phishing always happens in the same way. The attacker first makes a fake message. This message often looks like it came from a bank, a delivery service, the government, your job, or a well-known online service. It could warn you about a blocked account, an unpaid bill, suspicious activity, or a request for urgent verification.Second, the message has an attachment or link in it. The link takes you to a fake website that looks a lot like the real one. Logos, colours and layouts are copied to appear genuine.Third, the victim enters personal information. Once login details or payment data are entered, the information goes directly to the attacker.In some cases, clicking on a bad link could install malware that records keystrokes or lets criminals access a device from afar.Phishing emails often make you feel like you need to act right away. For instance, a message might say that an account will be closed in 24 hours if no action is taken right away.Phishing is not limited to email. Criminals constantly adapt their methods. Below are the different types of phishing attacks that one needs to be careful of:Phishing works because it targets human psychology. Criminals create fear by claiming suspicious transactions have occurred. They create urgency by saying accounts will be suspended. They create excitement by promising lottery winnings or refunds.Many people assume that if an email includes official logos or appears professionally written, it must be legitimate. Attackers exploit this trust.Phishing also succeeds because people often access email on mobile devices, where URLs are harder to examine carefully.Even though phishing emails may look real, they often have warning signs that are as follows:To stay safe, you need to be aware and follow some basic digital hygiene rules. To keep yourself safe from phishing, follow these steps:Because one employee's mistake can expose company systems, organizations are at greater risk.

‘Treating teens like teens’

At a time when AI companies are under pressure to offer safe chatbot conversation experiences to kids, OpenAI , the company behind ChatGPT, has released safety blueprint for teens in India. The company emphasises that it aims to keep safety over privacy for younger users. “We're taking steps to strengthen protections for Indian teens through age prediction, age-appropriate policies, and parental controls, informed by conversations with policymakers, regulators, educators, and child safety experts, as well as mental health and digital well-being practitioners,” the company says in the report.According to OpenAI, the new protections come in addition to features already available for all users. These include in-app reminders during long sessions to encourage breaks; safeguards that direct users to real-world resources if the company’s systems detect they have expressed suicidal intent. The company also offers “ways to escalate risks of physical harm to others for human reviewers who can take action; and industry-leading prevention of Al-generated child sexual abuse material (SAM) and child sexual exploitation material (CSEM).In particular, we constantly improve our CSAM/CSEM detection methods and report confirmed CSAM to relevant authorities.”OpenAI claims that it aims to ensure that all teens using Al receive age-appropriate protections by default, and that parents and educators can deploy additional protections to personalize how teens use Al.OpenAI’s blueprint acknowledges a hurdle unique to the Indian market: the prevalence of shared technology. According to the RATI Foundation’s Ideal Internet Report 2024-25, approximately 62% of Indian teens access the internet via shared family devices.The core of the new framework is the concept of “age-aware AI behaviour.” OpenAI argues that AI responses should not be “one-size-fits-all,” advocating for a system where ChatGPT recognises the developmental stage of the user.“We believe that Al companies should identify teens on their platforms using privacy-protective, risk-based age estimation tools to distinguish between teens and adults. These tools should minimize the collection of sensitive personal data, while still effectively distinguishing users under the age of 18 (U18). Where possible, these methods might also rely on operating systems or app stores to determine a user's age,” the company says.Furthermore, the framework introduces enhanced Parental Controls, allowing parents to link accounts, set “blackout hours” for AI usage, and remotely disable chat history and memory features.","OpenAI has released safety blueprint for teens in India.
