"Oracle founder Larry Ellison tells the biggest problem with AI models from Google, OpenAI, Meta, and other big tech companies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/oracle-founder-larry-ellison-tells-the-biggest-problem-with-ai-models-from-google-openai-meta-and-other-big-tech-companies/articleshow/126430918.cms,"Oracle's Larry Ellison believes AI's next frontier is private enterprise data, not just public internet. He argues current models are commoditized and true value lies in securely accessing and reasoning over sensitive company information. Oracle is investing heavily, leveraging its vast database presence to become the enterprise AI backbone, facing competition from cloud rivals.

Oracle bets big on becoming the enterprise AI backbone

The race for private data access heats up





Oracle founder and CTO Larry Ellison has identified what he calls the critical limitation holding back AI models from Gemini to ChatGPT: they're all trained on the same publicly available internet data, making them increasingly commoditized with little real differentiation between them.Speaking during Oracle's fiscal Q2 2026 earnings call in December, Ellison argued that while training foundational models on public data has created ""the largest and fastest-growing business in human history,"" the real value lies ahead in a second phase: enabling these models to securely reason over private enterprise data without compromising security.""For these models to reach their peak value, you need to train them not just on publicly available data, but make privately owned data available for those models as well,"" Ellison said. He estimates this next phase will prove ""even larger and more valuable"" than the current GPU and data center boom.Oracle is positioning itself as uniquely equipped for this shift. The company points out that most of the world's high-value private data already lives in Oracle databases. Its AI Data Platform uses techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation to let any major AI model query private data in real-time while maintaining security.The company is backing this vision with aggressive spending, projecting roughly $50 billion in capital expenditures for the full year, up from $35 billion estimated in September. At Oracle AI World in October, the company announced partnerships including a 50,000-GPU AI supercluster with AMD MI450 chips launching in Q3 2026, and the OCI Zettascale10 supercomputer connecting hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs.Ellison's thesis faces challenges from multiple angles. Synthetic data generation could reduce dependence on exclusive proprietary data sets; real-time user interaction data from consumer apps could turn out to be more valuable than static enterprise records. At the same time, rivals like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are racing to develop comparable enterprise AI capabilities, though Oracle argues its established grip on enterprise databases gives it a strategic advantage. By late 2025, the company's cloud backlog had topped $500 billion, driven mostly by demand for AI.","Oracle's Larry Ellison believes AI's next frontier is private enterprise data.

Nvidia’s Alpamayo to debut with Mercedes CLA





At the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Nvidia launched Alpamayo – an open source AI model for autonomous vehicles. Announcing the new AI model, CEO Jensen Huang said that it is the world’s first thinking, reasoning autonomous vehicle AI. He further revealed that the Alpamayo is launching on US roads later this year, starting with the Mercedes CLA. “Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments, and explain their driving decisions,” he further added. Responding to one such posts about the autonomous vehicle AI, Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote:“Well that’s just exactly what Tesla is doing 😂 What they will find is that it’s easy to get to 99% and then super hard to solve the long tail of the distribution.”Alpamayo introduces Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models designed for self-driving systems. The models will allow autonomous vehicles to understand visual inputs, assess driving situations and decide on driving actions. The platform also includes large reasoning models, simulation tools to test rare or unusual driving situations, and open datasets that can be used for training and validation.Talking about Alpamayo, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement that “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here – when machines begin to understand, reason, and act in the real world”.“It's trained end-to-end. Literally from camera in to actuation out; It reasons what action it is about to take, the reason by which it came about that action, and the trajectory”, he added.""With a 10-billion-parameter architecture, Alpamayo 1 uses video input to generate trajectories alongside reasoning traces, showing the logic behind each decision. Developers can adapt Alpamayo 1 into smaller runtime models for vehicle development, or use it as a foundation for AV development tools such as reasoning-based evaluators and auto-labeling systems. Alpamayo 1 provides open model weights and open-source inferencing scripts. Future models in the family will feature larger parameter counts, more detailed reasoning capabilities, more input and output flexibility, and options for commercial usage,"" he continued.As mentioned above, Nvidia has partnered with Mercedes to bring its autonomous vehicle AI. Announcing the partnership, the chip maker said “NVIDIA is enabling a new era of AI-defined driving, bringing its NVIDIA DRIVE AV software with enhanced level 2 point-to-point driver assistance capabilities to U.S. roads, expected by end of this year — starting with Mercedes-Benz, a long-standing partner in advancing safe, intelligent mobility. ”“The all-new Mercedes-Benz CLA — the brand’s first vehicle featuring the MB.OS platform — introduces advanced driver-assistance features powered by NVIDIA’s full-stack DRIVE AV software, AI infrastructure and accelerated compute.This design may enable over-the-air updates of future upgrades and new features, including planned enhancements to MB.DRIVE ASSIST PRO, which may be available ex-factory and through the Mercedes-Benz store.”","Nvidia’s Alpamayo to debut with Mercedes CLA later this year.

EXPOSED: Mark Zuckerberg Embarrassed on Hot Mic Admitting Total Confusion During Trump Dinner





Ever since Mark Zuckerberg announced the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs in first half of 2025, Meta CEO has been on an AI hiring blitz. A Twitter user who goes by the moniker @HinataMotivates, said to be a tech-motivation account, shared a podcast clip (going back to 2022) where Zuckerberg talks about Meta hiring rule and his advice for college students. Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone and the one that he says is also an important tip for any college student. In an episode of the “Lex Fridman Podcast,” hosted by MIT computer scientist Lex Fridman, Zuckerberg said that most people know Facebook ’s dorm-room origin story and that many have learned the wrong lesson from it. He said that his initial ability to launch Facebook wasn’t because he dropped out of college. According to Zuckerberg, it was due to the personal connections he made while he was still in school.Who you spend time with in college, Zuckerberg said, is “the most important decision” any student can make in college. He advised college students that choosing their social circle is the most pivotal decision, as people tend to emulate those around them. “You become the people you surround yourself with,” he said in the podcast.“I think probably people are too, in general, objective focused, and maybe not focused enough on the connections and the people who they’re basically building relationships [with]. ” Meta CEO Zuckerberg is said to have met his Facebook co-founders ⁠— Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes and Andrew McCollum ⁠— while the five were students at Harvard University.While the group split up in a not-so-happy manner, Zuckerberg said on the podcast that he tries to prioritize relationships over objectives. This applies especially to hiring. Zuckerberg said that he extends the idea to his Meta hiring philosophy: He only employs candidates he did hypothetically work for, underscoring reciprocity and alignment in professional networks. When evaluating a job candidate, he imagines what it would be like to work for that person. “I will only hire someone to work for me if I can see myself working for them,” he said.Mark Zuckerberg said that the strategy creates a work environment that’s both more cohesive and more productive: If you work with people who share your values on a human level, you’ll be more likely to smoothly achieve your work goals together. It’s all about finding personal compatibility, he said, not unlike “choosing friends or a partner.”","Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone.

Zoho senior engineer ships three-week projects in one day





Zoho founder and Chief Scientist Sridhar Vembu has revealed that one of his engineers recently built a sophisticated assembly and machine code security tool alone in just one month—work that would typically require a team of three to four developers an entire year. The breakthrough, Vembu disclosed on X, came after the engineer discovered Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 model, which he called a ""game changer"" that finally convinced him AI-generated code was worth using.""I did not know he was building it. I was blown away by the depth and breadth of the tool,"" Vembu wrote, describing how the experienced developer from his R&D team created the project in his spare time. The Zoho founder characterized the moment as the arrival of ""powerful machine looms for software development,"" comparing the disruption to how mechanized weaving once challenged traditional handloom workers.The productivity gains extend across Zoho's engineering organization. Vembu shared that one of the company's most productive engineers—a veteran with two decades of experience handling performance-critical UI work—is now completing in a single day what previously took three weeks. ""AI needed him to provide the structure, it fleshed out the details and that required him to draw on his experience,"" Vembu explained.The Indian SaaS giant has rolled out AI coding tools company-wide but with strict guardrails. Engineers must review and approve all AI-generated code and take full responsibility for it, Vembu emphasized. Zoho doesn't mandate AI usage, instead leaving implementation decisions to experienced developers who can assess when the technology adds value.Even junior developers are seeing breakthroughs. Vembu noted that a less experienced team member built an internal tool with AI assistance that's now being used across multiple teams—work that wouldn't have been possible without the technology. For UI development specifically, Vembu's team is ""very bullish on AI.""""As Chief Scientist, I am under pressure,"" Vembu admitted, acknowledging the technology's transformative impact.

AI, Aircraft and Salt Crystals: How the UAE Is Boosting Rainfall

Cloud seeding myths, misunderstandings and real weather



How cloud seeding works

Bottom line







Even if you have never been to a desert, you would have seen it on screens, how rain bursts despite arid desert sun but in the UAE, rain does not just happen by chance. Behind the scenes, scientists are actively nudging clouds to drop more water, using aircraft, salt crystals, artificial intelligence and some of the world’s most advanced weather-tech. Yes, there is a real-world rain machine in one of the planet’s driest regions.Welcome to the UAE’s cloud-seeding programme, a long-running national effort to enhance rainfall in a place that normally gets less than 100 mm of rain a year.The concept is simpler than it sounds. The UAE does not create rain from thin air, it enhances rain that might already be there. Scientists constantly scan the skies using sophisticated weather radars and 26 live camera feeds to spot developing cumulus clouds with potential.When conditions look right, they are ready to act. From meteorological radar data to real-time cloud analysis, researchers identify the best moments and places to intervene, no crystal balls required.When suitable clouds form, specially equipped aircraft take to the skies. Pilots fly into the updrafts, rising currents of air within convective clouds and deploy seeding agents like microscopic salt crystals mixed with magnesium, sodium chloride and potassium chloride.These tiny particles act as condensation nuclei, meaning that they attract and cluster water droplets within the cloud. As droplets grow larger and heavier, gravity finally pulls them down as rainfall instead of letting them evaporate in the dry desert air.In 2025 alone, the UAE reported 172 cloud-seeding flights, aiming to boost rain, not create weather from nothing.Think cloud seeding is stuck in the last century? The truth is that the UAE has invested in cutting-edge innovations -Together, these upgrades are pushing cloud-seeding into a more efficient “rain-tech” arena rather than a simple aerial stunt.Studies and operational data suggest that cloud seeding can increase rainfall by roughly 10% to 25% under the right conditions and is significant when every extra drop counts. Some research even links cloud-seeded storms to larger volumes of water reaching the ground, with gains measured in hundreds of millions of cubic metres of usable water annually, a real lifeline in a region where water security is a top priority.Still, experts caution that cloud seeding is not a perfect rainmaker as it cannot produce rain unless clouds already have moisture and results can vary depending on atmospheric conditions. The UAE’s water challenges are real. Rapid urban growth and limited natural freshwater mean the country relies heavily on desalination plants, recycled water and cloud seeding to meet its needs.Cloud seeding is far more cost-effective than desalination for extra water as one flight costs around US $8,000 per hour, a bargain when compared to the energy and infrastructure required to turn seawater into drinking water. That is why the UAE has invested millions of dollars into research and technology, including local manufacturing of seed materials and international scientific partnerships.Despite its gains, cloud seeding sometimes gets blamed for extreme weather like the surprising flooding seen in parts of the Emirates. However, meteorologists are clear that cloud seeding cannot create storms out of nothing. Heavy rains during major weather events are natural phenomena that cloud seeding can neither trigger nor control.In social media discussions, some critics call cloud seeding “scam technology” or blame it for unexpected rainfall but even sceptics acknowledge that the programme generally only enhances rain when clouds already exist. Cloud seeding in the UAE is not about controlling nature, it is about coaxing nature to give a little extra.As climate change increases weather unpredictability and water scarcity pressures mount, experts see rain enhancement as one valuable tool among many. Whether it is planes, drones, nano-powder or AI pilots, the UAE’s cloud-seeding programme is a fascinating blend of technology, meteorology and environmental strategy. It is a uniquely desert-born experiment in making the sky work for people.The UAE’s effort to “make it rain” is not science fiction, it is a real, high-tech programme combining radar, planes, salts, nano-materials and AI to enhance rainfall in one of the driest climates on Earth. While it has limitations, cloud seeding represents a creative response to water scarcity, one that other water-stressed regions are watching closely.","In 2025 alone, the UAE reported 172 cloud-seeding flights, aiming to boost rain, not create weather from nothing.

Q: How much time should I be dedicating to career cushioning?

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers.

SanDisk Optimus is the new name for WD Black and Blue Drives,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/laptops-pc/sandisk-optimus-is-the-new-name-for-wd-black-and-blue-drives/articleshow/126440079.cms,"SanDisk is retiring its popular WD Black and WD Blue SSD branding for gaming and performance drives, introducing the 'Optimus' name at CES 2026. The new lineup features three tiers: Optimus for creators, Optimus GX for gamers, and Optimus GX Pro for high-end professionals.





SanDisk is moving on from Western Digital's iconic color-coded branding. The storage giant announced at CES 2026 that its gaming and performance SSDs will now carry the Optimus name, retiring the well-known WD Black and WD Blue labels that enthusiasts have trusted for years.The rebrand splits into three tiers. The base Optimus line targets content creators looking for solid performance without breaking the bank—essentially the old WD Blue drives like the SN5100.The Optimus GX are gaming-focused drives prioritizing quick load times and promising not to drain your system's power, taking over from WD Black models like the SN7100. The top-shelf Optimus GX Pro is where SanDisk parks its fastest hardware, built for developers and pros running AI workstations or souped-up gaming rigs that demand every ounce of performance. Think of it as the replacement for premium WD Black drives like the SN8100.SanDisk says the new naming scheme makes it easier to identify which drive fits your needs, though some might argue the old color system was pretty straightforward. The company is also introducing fresh packaging with bold red, black, and white designs that look nothing like the previous generation.The Optimus name has roots in SanDisk's history—it originally came from SMART Storage Systems, which SanDisk acquired back in 2013.The last Optimus-branded drive launched in 2014 before the line went dormant, making this a comeback story of sorts.Products with the new branding will start appearing on shelves worldwide during the first half of 2026. Older WD-branded drives will stick around while supplies last, though don't expect major clearance sales given how unpredictable SSD pricing tends to be. The transition officially kicked off with Sunday's announcement at CES.","SanDisk is retiring its popular WD Black and WD Blue branding for gaming and performance drives.

"Did Starmer impose a curfew in the UK? No, it's just a fake TikTok video",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/did-starmer-impose-a-curfew-in-the-uk-no-its-just-a-fake-tiktok-video/articleshow/126262276.cms,"Keir Starmer

Coup In Britain? Starmer’s ‘Own Cabinet Plots’ His Downfall | ‘Full Bunker Mode’ In No. 10





The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true. ""The UK is set to introduce a nationwide curfew, beginning at 11pm each night,"" he appears to say on one of thousands of TikTok videos of him posted in last six months. ""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok. By Dec 19, most appeared to have been removed from the platform. Howard said the use of AI in politics is increasing rapidly. ""We know it's internationally pervasive now,"" he said. ""Four of every five elections around the world now have AI-generated political junk that is unattributed and clearly misleading.

National weather alerts

What to expect in the coming days?

Humidity levels will remain elevated at night and mornings, creating chances for fog and mist.



Temperatures will continue to be cooler than average, especially in the northern and mountainous regions.



Cloud cover and scattered showers might extend beyond rainfall areas, making weather conditions changeable day to day.





Residents in the Northern Emirates woke up to the rhythmic sound of heavy rain today as a significant weather system moved across the region. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) reported intense downpours specifically hitting areas like Khorfakkan, Masafi, and Al Manama. While the rain brought a welcome drop in temperature and a refreshing ""winter vibe,"" it also turned streets into temporary streams, particularly in the mountainous regions of Fujairah.The showers weren't just a light drizzle; in many areas, the rain was accompanied by flashes of lightning and the distant rumble of thunder. For those living on the east coast, the grey skies provided a dramatic backdrop to the start of the weekend, but they also signaled a need for immediate caution as the volume of water quickly filled the natural depressions in the landscape.The NCM has issued both yellow and red alerts for large parts of the Northern and Eastern UAE. These color-coded warnings indicate that residents should be ""on the lookout"" and ""vigilant"" as convective clouds continue to form. These clouds are the primary engines behind the heavy rainfall and are expected to move further inland, potentially bringing scattered showers to parts of Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah as the day progresses.Weather experts explain that this surge in rain is caused by an extension of a surface low pressure, combined with an upper-air low pressure. This mix creates unstable conditions that are perfect for rain-bearing clouds to cluster. Wind speeds are also expected to pick up, reaching up to 40 km/h, which may kick up dust and reduce visibility on highways, making the commute between emirates a bit more challenging than usual.The winter weather pattern bringing rain is typical for this season in the UAE, and forecasters expect it to last through the weekend and into next week.Residents and visitors should keep up with modern updates from the NCM and follow official safety guidance as weather evolves.With unsettled weather expected to continue, residents across the UAE are advised to stay alert and follow official updates from the National Centre of Meteorology. Drivers should remain cautious on wet roads and during periods of reduced visibility, particularly in northern and eastern regions. Weather conditions may change quickly, with intermittent showers and cloudy skies likely through the day. Authorities urge the public to prioritise safety and plan travel accordingly.","The National Centre of Meteorology has issued both yellow and red alerts for large parts of the Northern and Eastern UAE.

Real-time monitoring





Privacy and community considerations





Supporting Dubai’s long-term waste strategy









Dubai is taking a bold step to keep its streets spotless by introducing artificial intelligence-powered cameras to monitor public cleanliness. The initiative is part of the emirate’s “Smart Waste Management” framework and aims to detect littering and illegal dumping in real time, enabling authorities to act swiftly. With fines reaching up to Dh500, the system reflects Dubai’s commitment to maintaining high environmental standards while embracing advanced technology.The pilot project involves mounting AI-enabled cameras on waste collection and transportation vehicles. This approach creates a mobile surveillance network that covers roads, residential neighbourhoods, and public spaces throughout the city. Unlike traditional methods, the smart cameras instantly analyse captured images and display violations on interactive digital dashboards. This allows field teams to respond immediately to incidents, ensuring cleaner streets and more efficient enforcement.The system focuses on a range of negative behaviours, including littering in public places, improper disposal of furniture and bulky waste, and other practices that harm the city’s appearance or lead to waste accumulation. Residents and visitors caught violating the rules face fines of up to Dh500, underlining the authority’s zero-tolerance approach to public littering.According to Dubai Municipality, the AI system provides real-time monitoring and instant insights for authorities. The cameras can detect illegal waste dumping near containers, on pavements, and in public squares. The instant analysis of images ensures that field teams receive accurate information quickly, allowing them to take corrective measures without delay.Engineer Marwan Ahmed bin Ghalita, Director-General of Dubai Municipality, highlighted that the project is part of a broader strategy to enhance monitoring efficiency, support data-driven decisions, and develop sustainable policies for the urban environment. He emphasized that the results of the pilot phase will guide future expansion of the system across the emirate.Engineer Adel Al Marzouqi, Executive Director of the Waste and Sewerage Agency, explained that the AI system documents violations accurately while respecting community privacy. The project aligns with Dubai’s broader smart city and digital transformation objectives, combining technological innovation with responsible governance.The initiative contributes to the Dubai Integrated Waste Management Strategy 2041. By improving monitoring, accelerating response times, and reducing waste accumulation, the system enhances public cleanliness and overall quality of life. Dubai Municipality aims to position the emirate as a global leader in sustainability and urban innovation, demonstrating how technology can be leveraged to create cleaner, safer, and more livable cities.","The pilot project involves mounting AI-enabled cameras on waste collection and transportation vehicles.

""Door-to-door"" concept





The UAE is on the brink of a transport revolution with Etihad Rail’s national passenger service, set to begin operations in 2026. After years of infrastructure build-out and testing, the first integrated passenger rail network will link cities from Al Sila in the west to Fujairah in the east, offering a safe, efficient alternative to road travel and boosting connectivity across all seven emirates.Etihad Rail’s network will feature 11 strategically located passenger stations that serve urban centres, desert communities, coastal towns, and educational hubs. The service is designed to be more than just a commute, it’s meant to reshape how people move around the country.The most significant impact of Etihad Rail is the sheer amount of time it hands back to the average resident. For the thousands who endure the daily grind of the E11 or E311 highways, the rail service represents a massive lifestyle shift. Operating at cruising speeds of 200 km/h, the trains offer a precise, congestion-free schedule that makes road-trip fatigue a thing of the past.Forget the cramped commutes of the past. Etihad Rail’s passenger fleet, designed by Spain’s CAF, is built to accommodate up to 400 passengers per trip with a focus on ergonomics and luxury. Whether you’re a professional looking to work on the go or a family exploring the Emirates, the onboard environment is designed to feel more like an airline cabin than a traditional train.Etihad Rail understands that your journey doesn't end when you get off the train. The strategy focuses on ""first and last-mile"" connectivity. This means major stations like Jumeirah Golf Estates in Dubai will be directly linked to the Dubai Metro, while others will feature integrated bus terminals and dedicated taxi zones.For the ""common man,"" this means you can theoretically leave your home in Sharjah, take a quick bus to University City station, ride the train to Abu Dhabi, and be in your office in under 90 minutes—all while reading a book or finishing a presentation.

UAE issues urgent recall of Nestle infant formula over toxin risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-issues-urgent-recall-of-nestle-infant-formula-over-toxin-risk/articleshow/126407858.cms,"Nestlé Infant Formula recall hits UAE and Gulf Markets / AI Illustration

Which products are affected?

NAN Comfort 1

NAN OPTIPRO 1

NAN SUPREME PRO 1, 2, 3

S-26 Ultima 1, 2, 3

Alfamino

Understanding the risk

The Toxin: Cereulide can cause symptoms similar to food poisoning, such as nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps.

The Resilience: Unlike many other bacteria, this toxin is heat-stable, meaning it isn't always destroyed by the boiling water used to prepare a bottle.

The Symptoms: If a child is affected, symptoms usually appear quickly, anywhere from 30 minutes to six hours after feeding.

Saudi, Qatar, Kuwait also warn



What should parents do next?

Do Not Panic: If your baby has already consumed the formula and is showing no symptoms (like repeated vomiting or unusual lethargy), there is no cause for concern.

Dispose or Return: You should either dispose of the product or return it to the point of purchase. Nestle has committed to providing full refunds for any recalled items.

Seek Advice: If you are unsure about what alternative formula to use, it is always best to consult your pediatrician.





The Emirates Drug Establishment (EDE) has announced a voluntary and precautionary recall of several Nestlé infant formula products sold in the United Arab Emirates. This recall comes after tests found traces of the Bacillus cereus bacteria in one of the raw ingredients used in these products. The bacteria can produce a toxin called cereulide, which may pose health risks if consumed.Authorities have stressed that up to now no illnesses or adverse health events linked to these batches have been reported in the UAE.The recall covers specific Nestlé infant formulas, including popular products used by caregivers:These batches have been quarantined in warehouses and are being removed from shelves, including both physical stores and online marketplaces across the UAE.It’s important to note that all other Nestlé products not included in the recall remain safe for consumption.The reason for this sudden move is the discovery of traces of Bacillus cereus bacteria in a raw material used during production.This specific bacteria can produce a toxin known as cereulide.Here is why the authorities are taking it so seriously:The EDE has confirmed that no illnesses or adverse events have been reported in the UAE so far.The recall is being handled ""out of an abundance of caution"" to ensure it stays that way.This action in the UAE is part of a broader regional response. The Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) has also warned parents in the kingdom not to use the affected products and has urged people to dispose of them immediately, emphasising it’s a precautionary recall with no reported cases of illness so far.Similarly, Qatar and Kuwait health authorities have issued warnings to consumers about possible contamination in certain Nestlé formula batches and advised caution.Across the region, regulators are working with Nestlé to ensure that all recalled batches are fully removed from retail outlets and distribution points.If you discover that you have an affected tin, the advice from health experts and regulators is simple: stop using it immediately.The UAE’s pharmaceutical and food security systems are designed to catch these issues early, and this swift recall is a testament to the country's commitment to keeping every family safe.","The Emirates Drug Establishment (EDE) has announced a voluntary and precautionary recall of several Nestlé infant formula products sold in the United Arab Emirates.

What is Dubai's Smart Rental Index?



Why are rent hikes in Dubai regulated in the first place?

Dubai Rent Increases Decoded: What Landlords Don’t Always Tell Tenants

How rent increase limits are calculated in Dubai



0% increase: If your current rent is up to 10% below the market average

5% increase: If it’s 11% to 20% below average

10% increase: If it’s 21% to 30% below average

15% increase: If it’s 31% to 40% below average

20% increase: If it’s more than 40% below average

Step-by-step: How to check if your rent increase is legal in Dubai



Visit the official DLD Rent Index page on the Dubai Land Department website. Enter your Title Deed number or manually key in your property details (area, number of rooms, contract expiry date and current annual rent). The tool calculates the average rent for similar properties nearby. It then shows the maximum legal rent increase allowed under the index bands.

What to do if your Dubai landlord demands too much



Present the official index result to the landlord in writing or via email.

Negotiate based on the legal maximum rather than the landlord’s figure.

File a complaint with the Rental Dispute Centre (RDC) at the Dubai Land Department, where the index can be used as statutory evidence to challenge unfair increases.

Bottom line: Rent transparency in Dubai







As Dubai’s rental market continues to evolve amid strong demand and population growth, tenants often grapple with rising rents and the question: Is this rent increase even legal ? Fortunately, the Dubai Land Department’s Smart Rental Index, an AI-powered official tool, now gives residents a clear way to check whether a rent hike proposed by a landlord is justified under UAE law.Whether you are renewing your lease, debating negotiations or simply planning your budget, understanding how rent hikes are regulated in Dubai is essential. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how the system works and how tenants can protect themselves from arbitrary increases.At the core of Dubai’s rent regulation framework is the Smart Rental Index, a sophisticated tool developed by the Dubai Land Department (DLD) to determine fair rental values across the emirate. Unlike the older system, which was updated annually by broad district averages, the Smart Index uses AI and detailed building-level data, including construction quality, services, maintenance standards and location, to produce real-time average rent figures for specific buildings and neighbourhoods.The index covers all residential areas of Dubai, including freehold communities and leasehold zones and helps both tenants and landlords benchmark rental rates against current market conditions.Under Dubai’s tenancy laws (including Decree No. 43 of 2013 and subsequent DLD regulations), landlords cannot arbitrarily raise rent each year. Instead, rent increases are permitted only during lease renewal and only if the Smart Rental Index supports the hike.Importantly, landlords must also provide tenants with a written notice at least 90 days before the expiry of the tenancy contract if they wish to raise rent or change any contract terms. Failing to provide this notice makes the increase invalid under the law, even if the index allows it.These rules are designed to promote market transparency and protect tenants from sudden, excessive rent hikes that could destabilise household finances.Dubai’s rent increase system sets strict limits on how much landlords can legally increase rent, based on how the tenant’s current rent compares with the average market rent shown in the Smart Rental Index -These bands help ensure that rent adjustments are fair and reflect genuine market trends rather than landlord discretion. They are automatically applied by the Smart Rental Index tool when you perform a legal rent check.Tenants in Dubai can easily verify whether a proposed rent increase complies with the official rules by using the online rent calculator provided by the Dubai Land Department:You can access this service via the Dubai REST app, the DLD website under e-services or the DubaiNow app, all of which provide the same official data. Once you have the result, you can print or screenshot the official calculation to use in negotiations with your landlord or, if needed, as evidence in a dispute.If your landlord proposes a rent increase that exceeds the legal limit shown by the Smart Rental Index or fails to give the mandatory 90-day notice, you have options:Tenants have successfully used this process to keep their rent at current levels when the index shows no increase is allowed, demonstrating the tool’s effectiveness.Even if the Smart Rental Index shows your rent qualifies for an increase, the landlord must still serve at least 90 days’ written notice before your tenancy expires. If they don’t, the increase is invalid by law and your rent must remain unchanged for the next contract period.This dual requirement, both index eligibility and timely notice, protects tenants from both unjustified and procedural rent hikes.The Smart Rental Index is not just a protective tool for tenants, it also helps landlords justify their pricing based on clear market data. This transparency can reduce conflicts and support fairer negotiation at renewal time.For tenants, the benefits are clear:For landlords, it standardises expectations and aligns increases with actual market trends, supporting sustainable rental growth across Dubai’s diverse property landscape.Dubai’s Smart Rental Index and the associated legal framework give tenants a powerful and free way to verify whether a rent increase is fair and lawful. Using the official online calculator and understanding the rules around notice periods and permissible increases allows renters to protect themselves from arbitrary hikes while helping landlords set rents that reflect genuine market data.With rent increases now a standard concern for tenants across the emirate, knowing how to use the Smart Rental Index could save tenants thousands of dirhams and reduce rental disputes. It is not just about checking numbers, it is about ensuring fairness, transparency and legal compliance in one of the world’s most dynamic rental markets.",Dubai’s rent increase system sets strict limits on how much landlords can legally increase rent.

The 6-Day Referral: By the sixth day of absence, the case is escalated to the Child Protection Unit.

The 15-Day Limit: If a student accumulates 15 unexcused days in a single academic year, the consequences are severe. The file is referred to external child protection agencies, and the student may even be required to repeat the entire academic year.

What parents must know?

Certified medical illness or travel for treatment.

Bereavement (death of a close relative).

Participation in official national or international events.

Emergency situations like natural disasters or ""force majeure.""





The UAE has rolled out a new rule that no student will be allowed to leave school grounds without an official exit permit from the school. This change comes as part of broader efforts by education authorities to strengthen student safety, discipline and supervision during school dismissal times.Officials emphasise that this is not just a bureaucratic step, it’s aimed at preventing unauthorised departures and ensuring schools can reliably account for every child at the end of the school day.The most significant change for families this year is the introduction of the mandatory ""Exit Permit."" Gone are the days of informal pick-ups; now, every student requires an official document to pass through the school gates at the end of the day.To secure this permit, parents are required to play an active role in the paperwork.You will need to provide a recent passport-sized photograph of your child and a copy of your Emirates ID. However, it isn't just a digital transaction. School administrations now require parents to attend in person to sign a written undertaking.This document clearly defines how the student will travel home, whether by bus, private car, or walking, and officially assigns responsibility to the person collecting themWhile there is a nominal fee for issuing these permits, school officials stress that this system is a non-negotiable prerequisite for student safety.It isn’t just the exit gates that are getting stricter; the Ministry of Education has also overhauled attendance tracking with a rigorous escalation system.If a student misses school without a valid excuse, the ""warning clock"" starts immediately.Parents should also be aware of what many are calling the ""Friday Trap."" Under the new rules, an unexcused absence on a Friday, or on days immediately before or after a public holiday, counts as two days against the student’s limit.This measure is specifically designed to discourage families from extending weekends or holidays without prior approval.To help families stay on top of these rules, the Ministry is rolling out an instant messaging system. Parents will now receive real-time notifications the moment their child is marked absent or late. However, the government recognizes that life happens. According to the latest guidelines, there are eight officially recognized excuses that will not result in penalties.These include:Documentation for these absences must be submitted within five working days. Schools are also required to create ""Individual Support Plans"" for students who struggle with attendance, offering counseling and motivational programs rather than just discipline.These new rules are part of a broader ""Student Protection Policy"" championed by authorities like ADEK (Abu Dhabi Department of Education and Knowledge) and the Ministry of Education. The goal is to create a ""locked-down"" environment where student safety is guaranteed from the moment they step onto the bus until they are safely back in their parents' care.By requiring ""mandated reporting"" from all school staff and using smart gate technology, the UAE is aligning its education system with global safety standards. As school leaders have noted, chronic absenteeism can set a student back by an entire year of achievement.","The UAE has rolled out a new rule that no student will be allowed to leave school grounds without an official exit permit from the school.

Rain Alert Issued as Saudi Arabia Heads Into Mid-Year School Holiday

Broader weather patterns in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia



Travelling During Saudi School Holidays? Rain May Affect Plans

Bottom line







Riyadh / Jeddah: The National Center of Meteorology in Saudi Arabia has predicted rainfall for most areas of the Kingdom during the upcoming mid-year holidays for schools. The forecast has raised urgent weather alerts and advisories among the residents and travellers.According to the latest weather forecast by the NCM, there will be chances of phased rain , from light to moderate and heavy rains, coinciding with the break, that may affect some major regions, including Najran, Riyadh, Eastern Region, Al Jouf, Tabuk, Makkah, Asir, Jazan. The weather alerts that have been issued include yellow alerts for light rains, while orange alerts have been given for regions where heavy rains along with wind and low visibility are expected.Under the warning system:The weather pattern occurs at a time when the country holds the mid-year holidays, a period when families often travel or plan outdoor activities. Thus, the warnings by the NCM come with the safety message of monitoring the official forecasts, avoiding travel when the rain is heavy and adhere to civil defence advisories.Such instances of disruptions in the weather have already been affecting the lives of citizens in the Kingdom.In the Riyadh area, authorities recently had to move offline learning to the online mode due to the bad weather conditions.Weather observers have noticed that it normally rains in Saudi Arabia and the Kingdom experiences dynamic weather phenomena in winters. Lately, it has been recording high levels of rain in western and northern parts, thereby disrupting traffic in some places due to flooding caused by the rain in those areas.Experts recommend citizens from the affected areas in Jeddah, Riyadh as well as other urban centres, northern regions and highlands tostay updated through official NCM accounts and civil defence alerts, especially as weather volatility increases during seasonal transitions.Saudi Arabia is gearing up to experience a period of rainy and unstable weather that could impact most parts of this country when it enters the mid-year holiday period, due to moderate to heavy rain, wind and poor visibility in most governorates. Caution warnings have been issued, especially in flood areas and highways, due to the adjustments in holiday plans based on this weather situation.","Rain expected in Saudi Arabia during mid-year holiday period.

What is causing this aurora event

Clouds and city lights change the experience





Northern skies do not always announce themselves. Most nights pass quietly, even when something distant is shifting above the planet. This week is slightly different. A pulse of solar activity is moving through Earth’s magnetic field, and that change may be just enough to push the northern lights into view across parts of the United States. It is not guaranteed, and it will not look the same everywhere. Some people may see soft colour low on the horizon, others nothing at all. Still, for a short window in early January, the odds tilt a little. Space weather forecasters are watching closely, and so are sky watchers, hoping the darkness offers something unexpected rather than empty for once during the coldest stretch of winter nights.The strongest chances sit far north, as they usually do. Alaska remains the most reliable place, almost separate from the rest of the map when it comes to aurora watching. Parts of:These areas lie closer to where Earth’s magnetic field funnels charged particles into the atmosphere. NOAA forecasts suggest activity could peak overnight between January 8 and January 9, though timing often slips by hours. In these states, the lights may form brighter arcs or slow-moving curtains rather than faint smudges. Even then, nothing is promised. Auroras are known for appearing briefly and fading without warning.States a little below the usual aurora belt are not entirely out of luck. Minnesota, Michigan, and Maine often sit on the edge during moderate geomagnetic storms, and this week could be another of those moments.The display in these places is usually subtle. Colour may appear washed out, sometimes closer to grey than green. It often stays low in the northern sky, easy to mistake for a cloud or distant glow. Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire, and parts of New York fall into a similar category. For viewers there, seeing the aurora often depends on patience and expectations. Many who do catch it only realise later when photos reveal more than the eye noticed at the time.The trigger comes from the Sun, though not in a dramatic, cinematic way. A coronal mass ejection has sent a stream of charged particles outward, interacting with a co rotating interaction region already moving through space. Together, they disturb Earth’s magnetic field just enough to produce a G1-level geomagnetic storm. That rating is considered minor, but minor does not mean invisible. It simply means effects are more local and less intense. Space weather remains difficult to predict with precision. Solar wind speed, density, and direction can all shift suddenly. Forecasts improve as the storm arrives, but uncertainty never fully disappears.Even the strongest aurora means little under thick cloud. Cloud cover remains the biggest reason people miss these events, regardless of solar activity. Clear skies matter more than most other factors. Light pollution is the next obstacle. Urban lighting can wash out faint auroras entirely, especially in southern locations. Rural areas, coastal stretches, and dark sky parks offer better odds. Many experienced observers suggest letting your eyes adjust and avoiding phone screens for a while. Cameras often see more than humans do, especially in low light modes. Sometimes the night still looks empty. Sometimes it does not. That uncertainty is part of the pull.","The strongest chances sit far north, as they usually do.

Ask Dhirendra: 'How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/mutual-funds/ask-dhirendra-how-do-i-decide-how-much-to-save-and-invest-when-my-income-is-just-about-enough/articleshow/126072787.cms,"The problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

If you have any queries for Dhirendra Kumar you can drop us an email at: toi.business@timesinternet.in

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries. The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric- enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125101750,imgsize-47068,width-400,resizemode-4/life-certificate-2025-step-by-step-guide-to-generate-and-submit-jeevan-pramaan-online-and-offline.jpg"

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Pensioners play a vital role in the social fabric of our society, and their financial security is paramount. To ensure continued access to pension benefits, annual life certificate submissions are mandatory for all pensioners. This process, which verifies the pensioner's living status, has been streamlined through various online and offline methods. With the recent initiatives to promote digital submissions, pensioners can conveniently fulfil this requirement and maintain their financial support.The requirement for pensioners to submit their jeevan pramaan patra is a critical process in ensuring the integrity and sustainability of pension funds. By providing multiple submission methods—both online and offline—the government is making it easier for pensioners to comply with this requirement. The ongoing digital campaigns further illustrate the government’s commitment to enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of pension services, ensuring that pensioners receive their benefits without unnecessary delays.The submission window for life certificates opened on November 1 for pensioners under the age of 80. This is part of an annual cycle during which pensioners must reaffirm their eligibility for pension disbursement. The deadline for submitting the life certificate is November 30. If the certificate is not submitted by this deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting in December. This requirement also applies to super senior citizens (aged 80 and above), who were allowed to submit their certificates starting on October 1, with the same November 30 deadline.Pensioners can submit their life certificates through several methods, accommodating various preferences and technological capabilities.

Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings



Posters, paperwork and early marketing

A wide-ranging collection of Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings and some of Apple’s earliest products has gone up for auction as the company approaches its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2026. The sale is being handled by RR Auction, which has opened bidding on 191 items spanning Jobs’ early life and Apple’s formative period in the mid-1970s.Among the centrepieces of the auction is the first known cheque issued by Apple Computer, Inc. on March 16, 1976. Signed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, the $500 cheque was made out to Howard Cantin, who designed the printed circuit board for the Apple-1 computer. The document predates Apple’s official incorporation and is described by the auction house as a foundational artefact from the company’s earliest days.Also drawing strong interest is the earliest known prototype motherboard for the Apple-1, alongside other rare hardware from Apple’s pre-Macintosh era. Early bidding has already pushed some items into the tens of thousands of dollars, with expectations that final prices could climb far higher.The auction also includes a functional Lisa-1 computer, a key transitional machine that preceded Apple’s Macintosh line, as well as a first-generation iPhone that was later jailbroken by teenage hacker George Hotz.Together, the items trace Apple’s evolution from a garage-based start-up to a consumer electronics giant.Adding a more personal dimension, the collection features items from Jobs’ childhood and teenage years, provided to the auction house by his stepbrother, John Chovanec. These include bowties, Bob Dylan 8-track tapes, and the wooden desk from Jobs’ bedroom at the Los Altos, California home later associated with the famed “Apple garage”.Other personal effects include components from Jobs’ own Apple-1 computer, hand-annotated car repair manuals, and a short handwritten note to his father on an early Apple business card.Rounding out the auction are original Apple marketing posters from the 1970s and 1980s, along with internal documents and ephemera from the company’s earliest phase. Together, the items offer a rare, material record of Apple’s origins and the personal world of its co-founder.Bidding for the collection is open until January 29, with interest expected to grow as the anniversary year approaches.","Collection of Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings and some of Apple’s earliest products has gone up for auction as the company approaches its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2026.

Three US senators have written an open letter to Apple and Google . In the letter, which is addressed to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai , the senators have asked both companies to remove X and Grok apps from their respective app stores until owner Elon Musk stops users from creating and sharing non-consensual explicit images and child sexual abuse content.In the letter, US senators Ron Wyden of Oregon, Ed Markey of Massachusetts, and Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico called on the tech giants toThe senators said that the apps currently allow users to generate and distribute illegal content through their platforms.

Earlier, apps such as Tumblr and Telegram were temporarily removed from Apple’s App Store for failing to control inappropriate material adequately.More recently, X reportedly restricted Grok’s AI image generation tools to paying subscribers. However, Grok’s standalone app and website still allowed users to prompt the system to digitally undress, sexualise, or demean people without their consent.According to CNN, recent Grok feature changes and the limited safety controls were pushed by Musk. The report added that three members of xAI’s safety team announced their departures on X following these demands.Despite the backlash, xAI said this week that it raised $20 billion in new funding from investors, including Nvidia and Cisco Investments, as well as long-time Musk-linked backers such as Valour Equity Partners, StepStone Group, Fidelity, the Qatar Investment Authority, MGX, and Baron Capital Group.","US senators have urged Apple and Google to remove X and Grok apps, citing the platforms' alleged facilitation of non-consensual explicit images and child sexual abuse content.

‘Human intervention needed in complex codes’





Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has shared insights from a code review of C++ generated by Anothropic’s LLM, saying that he was impressed but thinks that AI still have room for development. He also suggested that LLMs coding still need human intervention but there has been a significant improvement in such capabilities in the last two years.According to Vembu, the review went on for hours in the tech town hall and it provided him a clear understanding on how LLMs work.“Yesterday we had a tech town hall in Zoho where we did a code review of the C++ code generated by the Claude Opus 4.5 model. It went on for hours late evening,” Vembu said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).“I now have a much clearer understanding of what these models do well: they are able to stitch together systems well, taking data from one system, reshape it and pass it to another system. There is often a lot of such ""glue code"" in these systems and that is not very complicated but it is very tedious,” he added.He also highlighted AI's strength in creating tedious “glue code” for system integration but noted that its tendency toward verbose outputs and reliance on memorised open-source patterns.“In general, AI models have ""memorized"" all the open source too and they are able to recall patterns from them (with some possibility of hallucination). They are also able to stitch various open source pieces together well,” Vembu pointed out.Vembu also highlighted that human orchestration proved essential during their review as it ensured usable results. He said that while AI excels at stitching components but it struggles with complexity.“Our senior engineer had guided (""orchestrated"" is the right word) this process. When the AI was stuck he helped ""unstuck"" it. This was a very vital contribution and without his experienced guidance, the AI output would not be useful,” he said.“We examined several C++ files with thousands of lines of code in each, looking for what I consider complex code. Most of it was straightforward glue code and only a tiny part of it was complex,” Vembu noted.“I suspect that the AI generated code tended to be needlessly verbose but I have to study it more to be sure. On the whole, I am both impressed and not super awed. I believe we can do better,” he concluded.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has shared insights from a code review of C++ generated by Anothropic’s LLM.

New search filters rolled out by YouTube



Dedicated Content Types: We’ve added a new Shorts filter to the 'Type' menu. This gives viewers more control over whether they see Shorts or VODs (long-form videos) in their search results, so you can find exactly what you’re looking for, regardless of format.

'Prioritize' Menu: The 'Sort By' menu has been renamed to 'Prioritize'. This refined sorting menu aims to maximize utility.

'Popularity' Filter: The 'View count' sort option has been renamed to 'Popularity'. This filter allows you to easily locate popular videos related to your search queries. Our systems assess a video's view count and other relevance signals, such as watch time, to determine its popularity for that specific query.





YouTube has rolled out new search filters which are designed to make finding videos easier and more intuitive. “We’ve heard your feedback and are enhancing the search experience by updating our filters to make them more effective and intuitive for everyone. Our goal is to equip you with more effective advanced search tools, ensuring you can consistently and efficiently locate the content you love,” said the company. One of the biggest changes rolled out by YouTube is a dedicated Short Filter which will enable users to specifically browse short-form clips or long-form videos. The update also reflects YouTube’s push to highlight its fast-growing Shorts format which competes directly with TikTok and Instagram Reels.We have made some key additions and renames to ensure our sorting options align better with your expectations:To streamline the experience, YouTube has removed two filters: Upload Date – Last Hour and Sort by Rating. The company said these options were not functioning as intended and contributed to user confusion. Broader upload date filters, such as “Today,” “This week,” and “This year,” remain available. “We are simplifying and reorganizing the filter menu to make it more intuitive and improve the overall search experience.

The Copilot Checkout tool will allow online shoppers to ask for recommendations, compare options, and pay for items within a single chat window on Copilot. Early partners for this rollout include retailers such as Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Ashley Furniture, and various Etsy sellers. In this partnership, merchants will remain the primary handlers of the transaction and customer data, while Microsoft will provide the AI interface for the purchase.Apart from this checkout feature, Microsoft has also released the Brand Agents AI tool for Shopify merchants, which will allow sellers to add AI assistants to their own websites. These agents are trained on the e-tailer’s specific product catalogue to answer questions and offer guidance in the brand’s specific tone. Shopify merchants will be automatically enrolled in the new checkout experience with an option to opt out.Microsoft Copilot’s new AI tools for online sellers: What are theyMicrosoft is launching a catalogue enrichment agent template in Copilot Studio as a public preview.

This ""Artificial Capable Intelligence"" benchmark, he believes, will reveal AI's real-world planning and decision-making prowess. While tech leaders like Sam Altman champion AI agents, some, like Andrej Karpathy, caution against current ""slop"" in autonomous systems.

Microsoft CEO 'Thrilled' About India's Growing Data Centre Capacity, Details Meet With PM Modi





OpenAI cofounder disagrees with CEO Sam Altman on AGI timeline





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently shared what he sees as a key test for the next stage of artificial intelligence (AI). As companies race to build AI agents that can act independently, Suleyman said he is watching for a milestone he calls Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI) on the path toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). He said that the test is simple in context but difficult in execution – whether an AI agent can legally take $1,00,000 and turn it into $1 million. He described the test as “modern turing test”, suggesting it will show how AI systems can plan, reason, make decisions and operate within real-word rules.“The next big milestone I'm watching for on our way to AGI: Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI). Can an agent take $100k and legally turn it into $1M? To me that's the modern Turing Test,” Mustafa Suleyman wrote in a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter).Suleyman’s comments come as several technology leaders including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff bet heavily on AI agents as the next major shift in enterprise software. Companies such as OpenAI, Salesforce, Microsoft and others are promoting agents that can carry out tasks with limited human input, from writing code to managing business workflows.Last year, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff called the rise of AI in the workforce a “digital labor revolution,” estimating that the software company has reached about 93% accuracy with the technology.In an interview with Bloomberg then, he revealed that AI is doing up to 50% of the work at Salesforce.In 2025, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicted that AI could soon automate up to 40% of the tasks humans currently perform. He also claimed that AGI could arrive before 2030.Recently, OpenAI cofounder and AI researcher Andrej Karpathy pushed back against the “agentic AI” hype, characterizing the current generation of autonomous AI systems as “slop.” Karpathy has directly challenged the notion that autonomous AI agents are on the cusp of delivering as promised, positioning himself in contrast to the optimistic timelines often suggested by figures like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.“I feel like the industry is making too big of a jump and is trying to pretend like this is amazing, and it’s not. It’s slop,"" Karpathy said on The Dwarkesh Podcast.“They’re not coming to terms with it, and maybe they’re trying to fundraise or something like that. We’re at this intermediate stage,” he added.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman proposes a new test for advanced AI: can an agent legally grow $100,000 into $1 million?

Weighing just 350 grams, it excels in close-up photography with impressive magnification. The lens features a quiet stepping motor for video and a customizable control ring. Compatible with Nikon's Hi-Res Zoom, it extends reach to 210mm.





Nikon has launched its latest Z-mount lens, the NIKKOR Z 24-105mm f/4-7.1, in India, bringing a versatile full-frame zoom option to its mirrorless lineup at an accessible price point of Rs 49,995.The new standard zoom covers everything from wide-angle landscapes at 24mm to medium-telephoto portraits and distant subjects at 105mm. Despite this flexibility, it weighs just 350 grams—light enough to comfortably carry through extended shooting sessions without causing fatigue.Close-up photography is where the lens shows some real promise. It focuses as close as 0.2 meters at the wide end and 0.28 meters when zoomed in, with a maximum reproduction ratio of 0.5× between 70-105mm. That's enough magnification to capture flowers, food, and small details with pleasing background blur that isolates your subject.Video shooters get a stepping motor that delivers fast, quiet autofocus without the distracting whirring sounds that can ruin audio. The lens also includes a customizable control ring that can be assigned to adjust focus, aperture, exposure compensation, or ISO sensitivity—whatever fits your shooting style.One of the highlights of this lens is its ability to work with Hi-Res Zoom on the following Nikon bodies: Z9, Z8, Z6III, Z5II, Zf, Z50II, and ZR. This has an effective range of 210mm, allowing for more flexibility when the photographer is not close enough to take a clear shot of the subject.Nikon has also included dust and drip resistance, although these are not touted as making the camera completely weather-tight. However, it is comforting to know that these are features in case the weather does not behave as expected.The NIKKOR Z 24-105mm f/4-7.1 will be available at Nikon outlets across India from mid-January 2026.","Nikon has launched its latest Z-mount lens, the NIKKOR Z 24-105mm f/4-7.1, in India.
