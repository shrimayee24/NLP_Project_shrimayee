Olivia Dunne and Toni Breidinger respond to confidence through a smile



Olivia Dunne’s Invisalign message inspires confidence beyond sports



On Monday, June 3, 2025, former gymnast and social media star Olivia Dunne, who is dating Major League Baseball pitcher Paul Skenes, opened up about how her new smile boosts her confidence. In an Instagram video, Dunne talked about how she partnered with Invisalign, the clear-aligner company and said, “Confidence hits different when you feel good about your smile.” Her candid moment caught the attention of NASCAR driver and model Toni Breidinger, who simply commented “Yes!” under the post. The interaction shows how Dunne’s message on feeling good about yourself is resonating across sports and social media.In the video posted on Dunne’s Instagram account, she shared how her treatment with Invisalign helped her feel more like herself on and off the gym mat. “For me, Invisalign aligners weren’t just about straightening my teeth — they were about showing up as me, on and off the mat,” Dunne said.The partnership between Dunne and Invisalign was announced publicly in early June 2025.Under the post, Breidinger left a simple but powerful reply: “Yes!” Breidinger, who races full-time in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series driving the No.5 Toyota Tundra TRD Pro for Tricon Garage, is also known for being the first Arab-American woman to compete in a national NASCAR series.Her endorsement underscores how the message of self-confidence reaches beyond just one sport.Dunne’s campaign highlights how something as simple as a smile can influence self-image, especially for an athlete who has moved from competitive gymnastics into brand partnerships.The clear-aligner company she’s promoting emphasises that its product helps people “unlock their smile glow-up.” Meanwhile, Breidinger’s one-word approval connects her motorsports platform with the broader cultural idea of confidence and authenticity.Also Read: Denis Purić’s Bold Shift To Kickboxing At 40 Sparks Debate Ahead Of His Takeru Segawa Showdown Both women coming from very different sports backgrounds are showing how personal care and self-belief matter in any field.For Olivia Dunne’s audience of millions, and for Breidinger’s fans in racing and modelling alike, this kind of message is accessible and relatable.

LUCKNOW: In a bizarre case, a family in Lucknow's Gomtinagar area has alleged that their 22-year-old son was driven to suicide on September 3 by an AI chatbot.The youth's father has demanded through a letter to the police commissioner and integrated grievance redressal system, an independent grievance portal governed by the CM's office, that an FIR be registered against the AI company for ""abetment to suicide through technology"".The deceased was found dead near Lucknow's Samtamulak Square with severe head injuries late on Sep 3. Initially, the incident was treated as an accident. However, a shocking twist emerged after his family accessed Ayaan's laptop.According to the victim's father, chat logs on the device revealed that the youth was conversing with an AI tool, seeking ""ways to end his life painlessly"".He claimed the AI allegedly provided him with information and emotional responses that might have influenced his decision.The youth's father alleged that the chatbot responded in an open, engaging manner to his suicide tips queries, rather than refusing or directing the user to help, or raising red-flag alert to the cops.The youth who worked in a private firm had been suffering from depression.Police have so far registered it to be a case of accident. Investigating officer Himanshu Dwivedi told TOI that an FIR under the charges of BNS 281 (rash driving), 324 (4) (causing mischief), and 106 (1) (negligent act) has been registered against unidentified persons. ""The matter is still under investigation, the youth possibly hit the divider while driving his two-wheeler,"" he said.","The 22-year-old was found dead near Lucknow's Samtamulak Square with severe head injuries late on Sep 3.

In a major push to consolidate its presence in the Indian market, OpenAI has announced that it will offer ChatGPT Go free to all users in India starting November 4. For the uninitiated, ChatGPT Go is OpenAI's mid-tier subscription plan for its AI chatbot ChatGPT. The move targets India, which the company identifies as its second-largest and fastest-growing global market. The year-long complimentary access to ChatGPT Go comes as a direct response to similar aggressive user acquisition tactics by rivals Google and Perplexity. Both companies recently waived fees for their premium AI features to appeal to the vast Indian consumer base.OpenAI's decision follows Google's move to make its AI Pro membership, priced at Rs 19,500$, free for students for a year. Similarly, Perplexity partnered with telecom giant Airtel to offer free access to its premium plan, intensifying the battle for AI market share in the country.ChatGPT Go, which initially launched in India in August at an affordable monthly price of Rs 399, was designed as a bridge between the free tier and the more expensive ChatGPT Plus subscription. The free ChatGPT Go tier will provide Indian users with significant benefits, including: Higher message limits; Increased daily image generation and uploads; Longer memory for more personalized and context-aware responses"".Since launching ChatGPT Go in India a few months ago, the adoption and creativity we've seen from users has been inspiring,"" said Nick Turley, Vice President and Head of ChatGPT, in a statement.

Simplified correction process: Under the previous system, even small errors in application forms required complete retyping and resubmission. The new GPSP 2.0 platform eliminates this hassle.

BLS International now has the ability to make minor corrections to already filled or submitted applications at no additional charge, saving applicants both time and effort.



Why the upgrade matters









The Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate General of India in Dubai have announced the rollout of a new digital passport system for Indian citizens in the UAE. Starting from 28 October 2025, all applicants will receive chip-embedded e-passports under the upgraded Global Passport Seva Programme (GPSP 2.0) — a step designed to make passport services faster, safer and globally compliant.The GPSP 2.0 rollout is part of the Indian government’s effort to modernise passport services for citizens abroad. Starting 28 October 2025, all Indian passport applications in the UAE — including new passports, renewals, and other related services — must be submitted through the upgraded online portal:At the centre of this upgrade is the introduction of e-passports, each embedded with a secure microchip that stores digitised personal data of the passport holder. The embedded chip conforms to international biometric passport standards, designed to ensure smoother and faster immigration clearance across global checkpoints.This digital enhancement brings Indian passports in line with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)’s benchmarks for biometric and machine-readable travel documents. The same ICAO standards also now apply to passport photographs — a requirement that has been in force for Indian expats in the UAE since 1 September 2025.The Indian missions in the UAE have outlined a detailed process for applying under the new system:The upgraded system offers several user-friendly improvements intended to make the passport process faster and more efficient:For the large Indian expatriate community in the UAE — one of the biggest overseas Indian populations in the world — this transition to e-passports represents a major step forward in security, efficiency, and global mobility. The embedded-chip passports align India’s travel documents with international standards, improving authentication and reducing risks of tampering or duplication.By digitising more critical stages of the application process, GPSP 2.0 not only significantly reduces paperwork and waiting time but also ensures a more secure and transparent experience for applicants. For Indian missions in the UAE, it further simplifies backend operations and ensures greater data consistency across systems.As the new system officially takes effect from 28 October 2025, both the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate General of India in Dubai have strongly urged applicants to familiarise themselves early with the updated procedures and to transition smoothly to the enhanced GPSP 2.0 platform.","The Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate General of India in Dubai have announced the rollout of a new digital passport system for Indian citizens in the UAE.

How the service works





Certified Passport Copy

Why it matters

Benefits for families





Quick, secure access to official passport data.



No need for in-person visits or submitting original documents.



Recognised for most official and school procedures.



Reduces risk of loss or damage to passports.



Supports Kuwait’s digital transformation agenda.





Part of Kuwait’s digital vision









Parents in Kuwait can now obtain certified digital copies of their children’s passports directly through the Ministry of Interior’s new online portal. The service,available for minors under 16, marks a major step in Kuwait’s digital transformation, allowing parents to download official, government-approved copies without visiting physical offices.Certified passport copies are verified digital documents issued by the Ministry of Interior confirming the authenticity of a child’s passport. Accepted by schools, government offices, and other official bodies, they eliminate the need to present original passports for verification. Parents can print or save these approved copies for use in most administrative processes.Eligible parents or legal guardians can log into the Ministry of Interior’s portal using their Civil ID credentials, select theservice, and submit their child’s passport details. Once confirmed, the certified copy can be downloaded or printed for official use. The process is entirely online, secure, and available 24/7.Alternatively, parents can also get the service through the Sahel (سهل) app — Kuwait’s one-stop platform for all government e-services. The app makes life easier by bringing multiple ministry services together in one place. From booking appointments and verifying data to getting instant government updates, it lets users handle everything from their phone — making access to certified passport copies faster and simpler than ever.The initiative simplifies life for busy parents re,ducing paperwork, queue times, and the risk of losing original documents. It’s particularly useful for school admissions, visa applications, and government procedures requiring identity verification. The system enhances data accuracy while demonstrating Kuwait’s broader commitment to digital government services.Developed by the Ministry of Interior in coordination with the General Directorate of Nationality and Passports, this service reflects Kuwait’s push to modernise public services through technology. It aligns with national efforts to create a paperless, efficient administrative system and deliver faster, citizen-friendly services to families across the country.","Certified passport copies are verified digital documents issued by the Ministry of Interior confirming the authenticity of a child’s passport.

Visa runs are a legitimate and convenient way to extend your UAE stay. By exiting to Oman or nearby countries and re-entering, you get a fresh visa stamp, allowing for a continued stay. Multiple service providers operate daily, offering both border and airport-based options. Ensure you're eligible, have all required documents, and plan ahead to avoid penalties.In the UAE, overstaying your visa comes with clear consequences , and a daily price tag. Once your visa expires, and you're beyond any grace period, you're subject to a fine of AED 50 (~USD 13.60) per day. In addition, you’ll need to pay an exit permit fee of AED 250–350 (~USD 68–95) when you leave. These penalties apply across the board, whether you’re on a visit visa, a tourist visa, or a residency visa.To avoid those penalties and remain in the country legally, many visitors turn to a well-established and structured option: the visa run.A visa run is the process of strategically leaving the UAE temporarily and re-entering, typically on the same day, in order to reset your visa status and legally extend your stay.It’s most commonly used by those who entered on a 30- or 90-day tourist or visit visa and need more time without switching to a long-term visa.This method doesn't violate any immigration rules. In fact, it operates entirely within the framework of UAE border control and is widely recognized as a legitimate solution for visitors and temporary residents needing more time in the country.Most visa runs are made to neighboring Oman, given its proximity and straightforward land border access from Dubai and other Emirates. Others may involve flying to nearby countries, depending on visa status, timing, or agency arrangements.The process is especially useful for:For nationalities that receive a visa on arrival, this can be a remarkably smooth process, often involving just a short trip to the border, then re-entering the UAE on a renewed entry stamp.Visa runs are a smart solution, but not a free-for-all. They're especially practical for travelers from countries that are eligible for 30-day visa on arrival in the UAE. These travelers can often exit and re-enter without any pre-approval, making the process both fast and relatively low-cost.Here’s a list of nationalities that currently benefit from the 30-day renewable visa on arrival and are eligible for UAE-Oman visa run services:Additional eligible countries include Uzbekistan and Mongolia. If your country is on this list, you are eligible to enter the UAE multiple times with a new visa issued upon each arrival, provided your documents are in order.It’s worth noting that border visa runs are typically limited to three consecutive renewals. After reaching this limit, you may want to explore alternatives like the airport-to-airport (A2A) visa switch or returning to your home country to renew or apply for a new visa. Some agencies also offer visa change flights to nearby destinations like Bahrain or Kuwait. Always remember, immigration officials have discretion and may deny entry if they suspect the system is being misused or if your stay doesn’t appear genuine.The UAE–Oman border is by far the most popular and practical route for visa runs, especially for travelers holding 30-day visa-on-arrival eligibility. Located about 140 km from Downtown Dubai, roughly a 1 hour 40 minute drive, this border crossing offers a convenient way to extend your stay legally without overstaying your visa. Multiple agencies run daily roundtrip services from Dubai to Oman, making it a dependable and widely used option for visa renewals.Since August 2024, nationals from the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Japan, and New Zealand receive a 90-day visa on arrival, valid over a 180-day period. After using these 90 days, re-entry on arrival is not possible until the next cycle; a pre-approved visa would be required to enter the UAE.That’s where visa runs or visa changes come in. Visa run services offer early morning (around 7 AM) bus trips to Oman (via Hatta or Al Ain–Buraimi), handling all visa paperwork. The package typically includes an express 60-day visa, return transport to Oman, and hotel accommodation during visa processing. You can relax while your visa is approved and return to the UAE by late afternoon (around 5 PM) with your fresh visa, all within the same day.If you're applying for your Omani entry visa yourself instead of going through an agency, you can do this easily through the Royal Oman Police (ROP) website. Select the unsponsored 26A visa, a 10-day tourist visa, upload a scanned passport and photo, and pay the 5 Omani Rial (~AED 48) fee. Processing time ranges from a couple of hours to up to three days. Once approved, print your e-visa and carry a hard copy with you on the trip.In addition to the service fee, budget for:This method is one of the most cost-effective and time-saving visa renewal strategies, provided you're from an eligible nationality and have all documentation in place. It's widely used by tourists, freelancers, job seekers, and anyone in transition to residency.Another option, particularly when land runs are not ideal or permitted due to visa rules, is the airport-to-airport visa run. This involves flying out of the UAE, to Oman, Bahrain, or Kuwait, for example, and returning with a new visa arranged in advance.While this option may require an overnight stay, depending on visa processing times, it’s often used by travelers whose nationality doesn’t qualify for a visa on arrival.This method is especially common when border runs are no longer allowed due to visa count or policy updates.Whether you’re going by road or air, here are the essentials:Though not mandatory, travel and health insurance covering both the UAE and Oman is highly recommended for any visa run.Several agencies in the UAE have made visa runs hassle-free by offering full-service packages that include transportation, coordination, and support:Both providers emphasize planning your visa run at least five days before your current visa expires, allowing ample time to avoid penalties or issues.Visa runs can often offer a clear, legal, and practical way to conveniently extend your stay in the UAE without breaking any rules. When done carefully through proper channels, with the right documentation, timing, and a full understanding of your specific eligibility, they serve as a valuable temporary bridge between short-term visits and more permanent residency arrangements.They're not a workaround or a grey area. They are a recognized tool in the UAE’s flexible visa framework, especially for tourists, job seekers, freelancers, and families who need more time, and who want to do it the right way.Just remember:And with that, you’ll find that staying longer in the UAE can be as straightforward as a bus ride to the border, and back again.Yes, visa runs are legal and operate within UAE’s border control system, as long as you follow the rules and have the correct documentation.The cost starts at AED 440 (~USD 120) for a border visa run and AED 1250 (~USD 340) for a 60-day visa extension with hotel accommodation.You’ll need a valid passport, passport copy, current UAE entry stamp, photo, and potentially car documents or a guarantor, depending on your situation.Border visa runs typically take one day, leave early morning and return by late afternoon. Airport-based runs may take 1–2 days.Border visa runs are generally limited to three consecutive times. After that, you’ll need to explore alternatives like an airport-to-airport visa switch.If you're using the border visa run option, no pre-approval is needed for most nationalities. For other visa options, you may need to pre-arrange the visa.You’ll be fined AED 50 (~USD 13.60) per day plus an exit fee of AED 250–350 (~USD 68–95) when leaving the UAE.","Visa runs are a widely practiced and accepted method used by tourists, job seekers, and remote workers to legally extend their stay in the UAE without overstaying.

UK launches first digital ID: Is it similar to India's Aadhaar? Full details of the plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-launches-first-digital-id-is-it-similar-to-indias-aadhaar-full-details-of-the-plan/articleshow/124630189.cms,"AI image used for representative purpose

Why UK government launched this plan



What is the use of ID?



How Veteran can use access digital IDs?



Is it similar to India?







The UK government launched the digital version of its ID scheme on Friday, intended for former members of the armed services.This ID will mean passports, driving licenses, national insurance cards, and many more being virtual, instead of—or as well as—being stored in a shoebox or under socks in a drawer, Sky News reported.The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.The govt claims the initiative is designed to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for those without status to secure employment.Ministers contend that the ability to obtain jobs is a primary attraction for migrants entering the UK unlawfully. Under the new system, employers will no longer be able to depend on National Insurance numbers—which currently serve as part of proof of the right to work—or on paper-based verification methods, BBC reported.""At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy—people sharing National Insurance numbers for example. The idea is that having a picture attached would make it—in theory—harder to abuse that system,"" a government spokesperson explained.The digital IDs, which will be app-based and stored on smartphones akin to the NHS App or digital bank cards, will contain information such as the holder's residency status, name, date of birth, nationality, and a photograph.Sir Keir, when announcing the scheme, stated: ""You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that.""From today, Friday 17 October, it will give ex-soldiers a seamless way to confirm their status in person and will include information already featured on their physical card with the security features that protect their personal information.Ministers hope the digital veteran card will show how the technology works and quash public concerns about privacy and security.Veterans will now be able to hold their credentials in a smartphone app called Gov.uk One Login. The govt had previously announced that digital credentials, including the veteran card, would be stored in an app named Gov.uk Wallet. It now states it will “transition to talking about [One Login] as the Gov.uk Wallet” as more govt-issued credentials become available digitally. The credential will be stored under encryption in the app, similar to how a train or concert ticket is held in an Apple or Google wallet, The Guardian reported.Verification using face ID or a fingerprint will be required to access it, and the govt claims it is safer than physical IDs. Another version of the credential will be held by the Ministry of Defence, and as more IDs are added, the information will remain with each issuer and in the citizens’ app, ensuring there is no central database of all ID data, thereby avoiding what some have feared could be a “honeypot for hackers”.India has well established digital ID system. India’s digital ID system, Aadhaar, is significantly larger and more detailed than the UK’s planned system.New Delhi stores citizens’ fingerprints, eye scans, photos, home addresses and phone numbers, with the system processing approximately 80 million authentications daily.Under Aadhaar, every Indian citizen receives a 12-digit number intended to replace numerous paper documents. All adults and children over the age of five must provide biometric information. The system verifies identities for activities such as opening bank accounts or applying for new SIM cards. It also aimed to streamline the disbursement of govt benefits, providing holders with instant proof of identity and access to basic services.Aadhaar and UK's digital ID seems to be same.India also have other apps like DigiLocker, where you can store all the important documents like Aadhar Card, Pan card, driving license digitally at one place, Digi Yatra and many more.The UK's digital ID seems to be following the similar model of India. Like DigiLocker, UK is introducing Gov.UK Wallet. Few days ago, UK PM Keir Starmer made his first trip to India and hailed India’s ID system as a “massive success”.During his trade-centric visit to Mumbai, Starmer also met with Nandan Nilekani, co-founder and chair of Indian tech services group Infosys, who led the govt body responsible for delivering the ID database more than a decade ago.",The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.

White House and GameStop trade Trump and JD Vance Halo memes — and gamers aren’t amused,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-house-and-gamestop-trade-trump-and-jd-vance-halo-memes-and-gamers-arent-amused/articleshow/124875267.cms,"Vance Defends Trump’s Meme War On Jeffries — Racist or Funny? America Stunned Amid Shutdown





In a bizarre mix of politics and gaming culture, the Trump administration’s social media team spent Sunday evening exchanging Halo memes with GameStop.It began when the White House’s official X account posted an AI-generated image of President Donald Trump dressed as Halo’s main character, Master Chief, standing before the White House and an altered American flag missing ten stars. The image was captioned “Power to the Players,” seemingly a nod to GameStop’s slogan.Gamers were quick to roast the post, calling it “AI slop” and accusing the White House of missing the point of the game entirely. Master Chief, the protagonist of Halo, is a genetically enhanced supersoldier who protects humanity from alien threats. Others mocked the attempt to appeal to gamers, saying it “completely misses the point of Halo.”The meme was actually a response to GameStop’s earlier viral post announcing the “official cessation of console wars,” after Microsoft confirmed a surprise remake of Halo: Combat Evolved would also arrive on Sony’s PlayStation 5 in 2026. GameStop styled its post as a diplomatic statement urging “console loyalists” to “cease hostilities, disband militias, and enjoy this new era of gaming.”Not long after, the White House joined in, and GameStop fired back.The retailer posted its own image showing Trump as Master Chief and Vice President JD Vance as Cortana, the game’s AI companion. The image appeared to be edited from Trump’s mug shot and a meme of Vance with a bloated face, which made the exchange viral.“President Trump presides over the end of the 20-year Console Wars,” the White House joked in one reply. GameStop later added an image of Trump shaking hands with Master Chief.GameStop’s stock briefly surged 7.7 per cent on Monday before dipping again, prompting comparisons to the 2021 meme stock craze. The company denied coordinating with the Trump administration, though CEO Ryan Cohen, a known Trump supporter, re-posted the Halo memes on his own account.The online banter reignited debate over how the Trump administration uses pop culture to promote its agenda. Recently, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was criticised for using the Pokémon theme in a border enforcement video.Video game analyst Daniel Ahmad also weighed in, saying Trump’s Halo meme was “tone-deaf,” especially given that Trump’s tariffs have been blamed for console price hikes across the industry.","The White House's official X account posted an AI-generated image of President Donald Trump dressed as Halo’s main character, Master Chief, standing before the White House and an altered American flag missing ten stars.

Gamers across social media are roasting the White House after it reposted an AI-generated image of Donald Trump dressed as Halo’s Master Chief — complete with an American flag missing ten stars.For context, Master Chief is the protagonist of the video game Halo. He is a genetically enhanced supersoldier created to protect humanity. In the games, he fights to save Earth and its colonies from existential alien threats. To many fans, linking such a character to Trump felt absurd.The 'AI slop' of a post showed Trump in Master Chief’s green armour, standing before the White House and an altered US flag with just 40 stars — a detail that didn’t go unnoticed. Both Democrats and Republicans mocked the image. But it was the gaming community that came out swinging the most.“Master Chief would never f***g be associated with MAGA lmao. You are the Covenant. Evil, theocratic fascists,” one X user wrote, referencing the alien enemies from Halo. Others flooded X with memes, saying the White House’s attempt to appeal to gamers “feels like a parody” and “completely misses the point of Halo.”The image was shared by White House in response to GameStop’s viral “end of console wars” post.The row began when GameStop posted a humorous declaration announcing the “official cessation of console wars,” following Microsoft’s decision to bring a remake of Halo: Combat Evolved to Sony’s PlayStation 5 in 2026. The post, styled as a diplomatic announcement, urged “console loyalists” to “cease hostilities, disband militias, and enjoy this new era of gaming.”The White House’s official X account then replied to GameStop’s message with the Trump-as-Master-Chief image — captioned ""Power to the Players.""

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Agent HQ: A single command centre



Centralised management: Developers gain a single command center to assign and monitor the work of multiple agents simultaneously.

Real-time control: Users can see exactly what their agents are working on and intervene to correct their course in real time if the AI gets off track.





Microsoft’s GitHub unit has announced Agent HQ, a new “mission control” interface designed to help software developers manage the complexity of AI coding tools. The platform will allow developers to assign and monitor AI agents – tools that can autonomously complete programming tasks on a user’s behalf – from multiple vendors all in one place.The proliferation of these agents – built by companies like GitHub, OpenAI, and Google – has created a management challenge for developers.“We want to bring a little bit of order to the chaos of innovation,” GitHub COO Kyle Daigle told CNBC.“With so many different agents, there’s so many different ways of kicking off these asynchronous tasks, and so our big opportunity here is to bring this all together,” added Daigle.Agent HQ will allow developers to manage coding agents from leading providers, including OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, xAI, and Cognition, all within the GitHub environment.Key functions of the new interface include:Daigle emphasised that the goal is to ensure the new “era of abundance for AI... doesn’t turn to chaos,” by providing a streamlined experience on an open GitHub platform.The third-party agents will begin rolling out to GitHub Copilot subscribers in the coming months.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai celebrates new breakthrough in quantum algorithm; Elon Musk replies: ‘Looks like…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-celebrates-new-breakthrough-in-quantum-algorithm-elon-musk-replies-looks-like/articleshow/124754841.cms,"



What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including Squid Game Unleased which hit #1 in 26 countries. You’ll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles – they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through. As for Bill, Scott and me – we’re going to take a little breather before tackling whatever is next. Love to hear from you if there’s anything interesting going on, workwise or otherwise.Another employee, David Luehmann, a director of game development at the studio, also posted on LinkedIn, saying, ""After 10+ great years working at Boss Fight, the last few as part of Netflix, the time has come for the studio to close down.""“I am very proud of all the people, work, and games we've released.

From photoshop to AI: Narayan says Adobe has a long creative legacy





Adobe brings AI models from Google, OpenAI and more to Firefly









Creativity is entering a transformative new era powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and the company is at the forefront of this revolution that will fundamentally reshape how people create content across industries, Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen has said. Speaking at Adobe MAX, the company's annual creativity conference in Los Angeles, Narayen outlined a vision where AI doesn't simply execute tasks but collaborates with creators.He said that AI will ask clarifying questions, plan multi-step workflows, and deliver personalised results that maintain human control and ownership.“Creativity is everywhere, fueling progress across industries, adding innovation, reshaping business models, practices, and most important, customer engagement. We're proud that Adobe has been at the forefront of this entire revolution,” Narayen said.Narayen traced Adobe's influence from “the earliest days of Photoshop to the groundbreaking advances” that have been unveiled at the conference. He emphasised that the new tools will make “creativity more fluid, more inclusive and more influential than ever before.”The CEO framed the current moment as a fundamental shift in how people interact with creative tools, enabled by AI's ability to understand natural language and intent.“Creativity is entering a new era as AI enables creators to immerse themselves in their ideas seamlessly with the mechanics of execution,” he said, explaining, “You'll be able to specify your desired outcomes in open-ended ways—whether it's reimagining the layout of a scene or adding or removing objects in a single step.”Narayen explained Adobe's strategic decision to offer creators choice among multiple AI models rather than locking them into a single technology.“Today you have more options than ever before to find inspiration as well as iterate on these concepts. Being able to describe what you want to do—whether it's text to image, text to video, text to audio—is a more intuitive and natural way to start the creative process,” he said.“It's why it was really essential for us to develop our own excellent foundation models with Firefly that are designed to be commercially safe, but also to give you the choice of multiple third-party models like Google Gemini, Imagen, OpenAI, Flux, Runway, Microsoft Mai, and others,” he added.","Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen spoke at the company's annual creativity conference in Los Angeles.

Agentic AI: Adobe introduces AI assistant in Express for conversational editing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/agentic-ai-adobe-introduces-ai-assistant-in-express-for-conversational-editing/articleshow/124883919.cms,"How Adobe’s conversational editing works







Adobe has jumped onto the Agentic bandwagon, unveiling an AI Assistant in Adobe Express that allows users to create and edit designs through natural conversation. According to the company, this will help content creators without design expertise make professional-quality content. The new feature, announced at Adobe MAX 2025 annual conference in Los Angeles, combines conversational AI with traditional editing tools.Adobe says that users can describe what they want in easy to understand, conversational language while retaining the option to fine-tune details using familiar controls like sliders and colour pickers.Unlike traditional design software that requires users to learn specific tools and workflows, the AI Assistant in Express allows people to simply describe desired changes in natural language.For example, a user can ask the assistant to “Remove the background” or “change the tone of the photo to more tropical,"" and the system will edit the photo with relevant content. It will automatically surface relevant editing tools like saturation toggles with matching colour tones, offering users to choose what’s right for their content.The assistant can generate edits on specific layers of a design—including fonts, images, and backgrounds—while keeping other elements intact, allowing iterative refinement without destroying work already completed.Adobe emphasises that the AI Assistant brings “contextual and semantic understanding of design elements,” enabling it to interpret vague or subjective requests and make intelligent design decisions.This capability transforms templates into what Adobe calls “conversational canvases” where users can generate images, change backgrounds and text, and replace objects without needing to know which specific tool or AI model to use.“Unlike other editing tools, the AI Assistant in Express enables customers to iterate on any aspect of their content with generative AI, making changes to individual elements, layers of an asset or across an entire campaign, without destroying the parts they love and having to start over,” Adobe stated.","Adobe has unveiled an AI Assistant in Adobe Express that allows users to create and edit designs through natural conversation.
