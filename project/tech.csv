Is Roblox really shutting down after backlash and ongoing scrutiny?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/news/is-roblox-really-shutting-down-after-backlash-and-ongoing-scrutiny/articleshow/123382058.cms,"(Image via Getty Images)

Is Roblox shutting down?



""While this was not an easy choice, we believe it is in the best interest of our community. We want to thank everyone who has been part of this journey. Your voices have been heard, and your well-being remains our top priority.""

""Effective September Ist, the platform will no longer be available,""

What can lead to Roblox finally being shut down in 2025?



A viral notice that claims Roblox will shut down on September 1, 2025, permanently has ignited a panic among its players. The message in the notice cited Roblox safety concerns and the popular demand for the platform to shut down, as the reasons behind their step. This notice that now seems to be all over X, and gaining a lot of attention, is coming at a time when Roblox is facing legal scrutiny and international bans. So, is this the end of the popular gaming platform, or is it just a part of the recurring hoax?Here is all we know about the circulating news and whether or not it is officially true.An official-looking announcement, stating Roblox is shutting down, has spread rapidly on X. It states that Roblox made a decision to shut down permanently from September 1, 2025, due to user demand and security concerns. The official announcement further stated,While the announcement that seemed to be official, stated,there is still no news of whether or not it is true. Quite crucially, no official confirmation has been received about this from Roblox. Fans are, therefore, speculating, it is just a hoax, like all the other times before. So, until any confirmation is received, one can relax and continue playing their favorite on the platform.This is not the first time that rumors of Roblox shutting down have surfaced all over social media. In the past, news about Roblox being shut down has spread and repeatedly, those were denied. The claims of Roblox shutdown were called rumors, and a hoax.The platform gave reassurances to the players that the game “isn’t going anywhere.”What’s interesting about the current circulating claims is that Roblox has been under a lot of pressure. From demands for the Roblox CEO resignation to changes in their policies and even the drop in the share price of Roblox, fans speculate that this time, the news can be true. Even the lack of denial or immediate confirmation from the end of Roblox is quite unusual. It has left this situation ambiguous, with players awaiting an official statement soon.While Roblox isn’t any stranger to controversies, the recent lawsuits against the platform by the state of Louisiana, accusing it of failing to protect the young crowd from inappropriate content and predators, have taken a major toll. Games like Public Bathroom Simulator Vibe, Escape to Epstein Island and Diddy Party have also been cited as examples of Roblox explicit content that have been accessible to minors.The lawsuit was not an isolated incident. Many countries, including Turkey, China, and Oman, have banned the platform. Now with Qatar's recent Roblox ban, after social media pushing to take action, over the platform's rising child safety concerns, have brought a lot of Roblox legal troubles. Critics argue that the rapid growth of Roblox has outpaced the platform’s ability to enforce needed moderation. While Roblox did bring in safety measures, including Roblox AI monitoring, there are many who believe all these measures are just reactive and not preventative.In short, with the Roblox international bans, lawsuits, and the player-led boycotts, like #BoycottTheHatch,” Roblox has been facing mounting pressure. The recent viral notice circulating about Roblox shutting down—whether fake or real—shows increased frustration amongst the users, critics and concerned citizens. Moreover, what actions are being taken by the platform that has reportedly earned a lifetime revenue of more than $1 billion and has made over $70 million in the payouts to the creators, for addressing the rising concerns of the authorities, gamers, general audience and others, only time would tell.As of now, the gaming platform remains operational, with millions of gamers aiming for it to be the same. However, the company being silent on the latest rumors is quite concerning. In case the legal actions do succeed, some stricter regulations can force major changes, or worse. It can even make the platform back off by finally shutting it down.","A viral notice that claims Roblox will shut down on September 1, 2025, permanently has ignited a panic among its players.

"Visa fraud: Indian-origin Rambhai Patel sentenced to 20 months in jail, deportation for organizing fake burglary",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/visa-fraud-indian-origin-rambhai-patel-sentenced-to-20-months-jail-deportation-for-organizing-fake-burglary/articleshow/123462340.cms,"Indian-origin man Rambhai Patel sentenced for visa fraud.

What is U-visa?







Indian-origin New York man Rambhai Patel, 37, has been sentenced to 20 months and eight days in prison in a visa fraud case that he pleaded guilty to. His prison sentence is followed by two years of supervised release and forfeiture of $850,000. After that, Patel is subject to deportation.Beginning in March 2023, Patel and his co-conspirator Balwinder Singh set up and carried out staged armed robberies of at least 18 convenience or liquor stores and fast-food restaurants across the United States, including at least five in Massachusetts. The purpose of the staged robberies was to allow the store clerks to claim that they were victims of a violent crime on an application for U nonimmigrant status (U visa). A U visa is available to victims of certain crimes who have suffered mental or physical abuse and who have been helpful to law enforcement in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity.During the staged robberies, the “robber” would threaten store clerks and/or owners with an apparent firearm before taking cash from the register and fleeing, while the interaction was captured on store surveillance video.The clerks and/or owners would then wait five or more minutes until the “robber” had escaped before calling police to report the “crime.” The “victims” paid Patel to participate in the scheme. One purported victim paid $20,000 to participate as a victim in one of the staged armed robberies. In turn, Patel paid the store owners for the use of their stores for the staged robbery. Patel earned approximately $850,000 in the scheme, all of which he is required to forfeit as part of his sentence.At least two purported victim co-conspirators submitted U Visa applications based on being victims of the staged armed robberies.The U visa is a type of non-immigrant visa in the United States created to protect victims of certain serious crimes who have suffered significant physical or mental abuse and are willing to assist law enforcement or government officials in the investigation or prosecution of those crimes. It was designed to encourage undocumented victims to come forward without fear of deportation, thereby strengthening public safety. To qualify, the crime must fall under specific categories such as domestic violence, sexual assault, trafficking, kidnapping, or similar offenses, and the victim must provide helpful information to authorities. The U visa grants legal status in the US for up to four years, along with work authorization, and after three years, holders may apply for a green card. Family members, including spouses, children, and in some cases parents or siblings, may also benefit through derivative visas, making the program a vital form of protection and relief for vulnerable victims of crime.","Rambhai Patel, 37, has been sentenced to 20 months and eight days in prison in a visa fraud case that he pleaded guilty to.

Reports say Prince William could seek new curbs on Prince Andrew’s titles as future king,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/reports-say-prince-william-could-seek-new-curbs-on-prince-andrews-titles-as-future-king/articleshow/123493801.cms,"Prince Andrew (Getty Image)

What is certain today

What the new chatter suggests

What the law actually allows

Royal Lodge context (often bundled into the rumors)

Where public opinion sits

What could change in the next reign

A new sovereign could:

Maintain the 2022 limits;

Tighten style/usage via letters patent (e.g., continued non-use of HRH); or

Ask ministers to explore legislation if removing a peerage were desired.

Bottom line

Facts today:





Talk has picked up again about what happens to Prince Andrew’s titles in the next reign. Several outlets claim Prince William wants a tougher line and could look at further steps once he is king. There is no official plan on record; the stories rely on unnamed sources and remain unconfirmed.In January 2022, Buckingham Palace announced that the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages were returned to the Queen and that he would not undertake public duties; at the same time, briefings confirmed he would no longer use the HRH style in an official capacity. He remains Duke of York and holds no front-line duties. None of that has changed.Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and, in some tellings, press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge. None of this has been announced; it is framed as a possibility, not a decision.A dukedom is a peerage, which is a legal dignity. Removing a peerage requires an Act of Parliament; the House of Lords Library is explicit on this point. The last time Parliament provided a mechanism to strip titles was the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, drafted for wartime enemies, hardly a ready tool for modern scandal.Any fresh action would almost certainly need new legislation.By contrast, styles (like HRH) sit within the sovereign’s power to define by letters patent, hence the 1917 letters patent that limited who is HRH. Using letters patent to refine style/usage is established; using them to annul a peerage would collide with statute and convention. In practice, government-backed legislation is the clean route for removing a dukedom.Prince Andrew holds a 75-year Crown Estate lease on Royal Lodge dating from 2003. Changing his residence would be a landlord-tenant and lease issue, not a simple royal edict. Reporting about pressure to move has see-sawed, but the legal baseline is the lease itself.Recent polling shows strong support for going further: 67% of Britons say Andrew should be stripped of his remaining titles; only 13% are opposed. That mood is real but policy still comes down to law and process.Any move to remove a dukedom would prompt debates on due process, precedent, and where to draw the line for other peers.Andrew does not use HRH, holds no military roles or active patronages, and retains the Duke of York title. Any further step is not something a monarch can do “on a whim”; it would almost certainly require Parliament. Until a legal route exists and is pursued, this remains talk, not policy.","Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself.

"Movement signatures: How we move, gesture, use facial expressions is unique; could be as different as fingerprint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/movement-signatures-how-we-move-gesture-use-facial-expressions-could-be-as-unique-as-fingerprint/articleshow/123483187.cms,"



MANCHESTER: The way someone walks, talks, smiles, or gestures gives a clue to who they are. Whether through the flick of an eyebrow, the rhythm of our walk, or the tilt of a head, movement speaks volumes.And my recent paper shows that people may have their own movement fingerprint. This is a style of movement that is characteristic of a person's identity. So, someone who uses expressive facial gestures might also speak with animated hand movements or walk with a lively gait. These consistencies could form a motion fingerprint that is unique to the individual.First, let's explore how faces move and why this matters.Everyone has their own style of moving their face, for example, how they raise an eyebrow, purse their lips, or squint when laughing. These patterns of movement help us recognise familiar people even when the visual quality is poor, such as in low lighting or from a distance. And as a person becomes more familiar to us, we become tuned to the way they move, learning their unique patterns of motion, just like we remember their face or voice.Human faces are constantly in motion; they blink, smile, grimace and talk, to name a few movements. Researchers categorise facial motion into rigid movements (such as turning or nodding the head) and non-rigid movements (like expressing emotion or speaking). It's the non-rigid movements that tend to be most personally distinctive.The way we gesture with our hands, shift our posture and tilt our heads all carry identity information. Gestures are often shaped by personal habits or cultural norms; for example, someone might habitually nod three times when agreeing, or use a distinctive hand wave common in their home country.Facial movements are synchronised with the way we sound. When we talk, our face plays a role in shaping the sound of our voice. For example, if you talk with a wide open mouth, your speech sounds deeper and richer. Studies show that people can match other people's voices to moving faces more accurately than to static ones. This suggests that dynamic cues to identity are present in the movement of the face and the sound of the voice.People with face recognition difficulties (those who are ""face blind"" or prosopagnosic) may be better at recognising moving faces than still ones. Typically, people who are face blind can see faces and the differences between them, but struggle to link the face to a specific person. Here, idiosyncratic information from movement can provide an additional clue to identity.Gait, a person's walking style, is one of the most studied body movements. Early research, such as a 2005 study, investigated participants' recognition of identity from gait using point-light displays. In this case, bright spots (lights) were placed on key areas of a person's body. All other visual cues were removed. Participants could only see bright spots against a dark background. The study found participants could tell fairly well who someone was from the way the spots moved.Characteristics such as stride length, limb movement, posture and pace form a consistent motion pattern that is unique and surprisingly difficult to fake, making gait analysis a reliable clue for identifying people.Movement fingerprintsMy review brought together evidence from behavioural and brain imaging studies to consider if such consistencies between different types of motion exist and how we might explore this phenomenon further. The paper proposes that people have an overall style of movement.More work needs to be done to find direct evidence of movement fingerprints. For example, we still aren't sure what part of the brain processes these movement-based identity cues.So far, research shows that the posterior temporal sulcus - an area of the brain located roughly above your ear on each side - responds not just to faces and bodies, but to how someone moves more generally. This area is active when we hear voices or see people speak, suggesting it may help link motion and sound. Also, this region plays a key role in allowing us to understand our social world, interpreting other people's actions, determining where they are looking, and picking up on social cues such as gestures, facial expressions and changes in gaze direction.However, it's probably just one part of a larger brain network involved in recognising others through motion.Real-world applicationsMotion-based identity traits aren't as stable or specific as fingerprints or DNA. They're what researchers call soft biometrics: useful but not always accurate.But as we better understand the link between motion and identity, exciting real-world applications are emerging.Motion analysis could support contactless identity verification from gait-based authentication at airports to gesture-based identification in smart environments, such as homes that respond to a user's unique movement patterns. In clinical settings, movement analysis might help support people with social cognition impairments, face recognition or movement issues. For example, helping a doctor identify changes in the way a patient produces non-verbal cues.But many questions remain. We still aren't sure how consistent motion fingerprints are as someone gets older and in different contexts. Individual differences in people and environmental factors like lighting, clothing or stress could affect them.Researchers also aren't sure how exactly we manage to understand all this movement in everyday life without even thinking about it.Figuring this out could not only help improve technologies like social robots and develop tools for people with recognition and communication difficulties, but also tell us more about how we process and react to other people. (The Conversation) RD RD","The way we gesture with our hands, shift our posture and tilt our heads all carry identity information. Gestures are often shaped by personal habits or cultural norms. People with face recognition difficulties (those who are ""face blind"" or prosopagnosic) may be better at recognising moving faces.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123483213,imgsize-1212831,width-400,resizemode-4/123483213.jpg"
Britain agrees to drop mandate for Apple to provide 'back door',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-agrees-to-drop-mandate-for-apple-to-provide-back-door/articleshow/123395824.cms,"Representative Image





SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain dropped a request for Apple to create a tool to give law enforcement access to customers' cloud data.

Swiss watchmaker Swatch has apologised and withdrawn an advertisement after it sparked anger in China for being racist.The ad showed an Asian male model pulling the corners of his eyes, a gesture widely criticised online as offensive. Chinese social media users accused the company of racism and called for a boycott of its products.On Saturday, Swatch said in posts on Instagram and Weibo that it had removed the campaign worldwide. “We sincerely apologise for any distress or misunderstanding this may have caused,” the company wrote.But many online said the apology was not enough. A popular Weibo user with more than one million followers accused Swatch of “racism against Chinese” and urged regulators to take action.Others claimed the ""slant-eye"" gesture"" was deliberate discrimination and demanded a boycott. ""The brand's image has collapsed. (Swatch) thinks they can just apologise and salvage everything? It's not that simple,"" one user wrote.China is among Swatch Group’s biggest markets, but like other Western luxury brands, the company has struggled with falling sales as the economy slows and buyers shift to cheaper options. In July, the group reported an 11.2 percent fall in net sales in the first half of the year, blaming weak demand in China.Swatch is not the first brand to face such criticism. Dolce & Gabbana faced backlash in 2018 for ads showing a Chinese model awkwardly using chopsticks, and Dior was accused of racism in 2023 over a photo of a model pulling her eye corner.","Chinese social media users accused the company of racism.

Dubai Police has taken a significant leap in modernising public services by opening a new Smart Police Station (SPS) in Dragon Mart. With this move, Dubai further strengthens its status as a global leader in AI-driven governance, offering residents and visitors 24/7 access to fully automated, human-free policing services—now across 27 locations.Smart Police Stations (SPS) are a first-of-their-kind innovation in the Middle East. These self-service, unmanned stations operate entirely without physical police personnel. Accessible 24/7, they provide a fast, contactless, and secure alternative to traditional policing setups.Each SPS enables users to complete essential police services digitally—via a simple, secure process that begins with ID verification using either an Emirates ID (for residents) or a passport (for visitors), followed by mobile number authentication via SMS. For services requiring interaction, users are connected through a video interface to an on-duty officer, with on-site access to facilities like scanners and printers to complete paperwork.Once a transaction is completed, users receive a reference number via SMS and receipt, allowing for easy tracking as requests are routed to the appropriate police departments for further action.Services are accessible in seven languages—Arabic, English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, and Chinese—reflecting Dubai’s multicultural population and making processes user-friendly for both locals and international visitors.Dubai’s SPSs offer a broad suite of 45 fully digital services, organised under four main categories:Since launching the world’s first SPS in City Walk in 2017, Dubai has continuously expanded its smart policing infrastructure. The network now includes 27 fully operational SPS locations—ranging from central commercial areas to suburban and residential districts.In 2018, a walk-in model of SPS was introduced at Arabian Ranches to expand accessibility. By 2023, plans were set in motion for a floating SPS at the World Islands, showcasing the innovative trajectory of Dubai’s policing model.Dubai’s SPS framework has drawn global attention, with police commanders from several countries studying its implementation as a future model for digitised public security services.The SPS initiative directly supports the UAE’s national artificial intelligence strategy, which aims to future-proof government systems, increase digital readiness, and enhance public service efficiency.Under the directives of Lieutenant General Abdullah Khalifa Al Marri, Commander-in-Chief of Dubai Police, the rollout of smart police stations is being actively expanded to cover commercial and residential zones across the emirate.Major General Khalid Nasser Al Razooqi, Director of the General Department of Artificial Intelligence at Dubai Police, emphasised that these smart centres are a critical part of Dubai’s vision to become the world’s smartest city. He noted that digital transactions now account for 89.6% of all police service interactions—a testament to public adoption and operational efficiency.","Dubai Police has taken a significant leap in modernising public services by opening a new Smart Police Station (SPS) in Dragon Mart.

'Trump A Threat To New York': Zohran Mamdani Challenges U.S. President On Takeover By National Guard









Mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani ’s attempt to flex his muscles at a Men’s Day event in Brooklyn ended in an online pile-on, after the 33-year-old Democratic Socialist politician failed to complete unassisted bench press rep.At the annual open streets celebration on Saturday, Mamdani tried to hoist a 135-pound barbell in front of a cheering crowd. But videos doing rounds online showed his spotter never let go of the bar, guiding the weight through two assisted reps before the Democratic nominee stood up, thanked the helper and exited the bench.The botched show of strength gained eyeballs on social media, giving his political opponents a chance to take on a mocking jab.Mayor Eric Adams took to X to release his own older video from the same spot, effortlessly pressing the bar under the supervision of the same spotter.“64 vs 33. A lifetime of hard work vs. a silver spoon. The results speak for themselves,” Adams wrote on X. In another jab, he added, “The weight of the job is too heavy for ‘Mamscrawny.’ The only thing he can lift is your taxes.”Former governor Andrew Cuomo also took aim, posting: “It’s easy to talk, it’s hard to carry the burden.”“This guy can’t bench his own body weight, let alone carry the weight of leading the most important city in the world,” Cuomo quipped.While critics had a field day, Mamdani’s supporters called the episode as a distraction.“Public service should be about policy and integrity, not proving strength in a gym setting,” one user wrote, urging voters to judge candidates by ideas, not biceps.","Zohran Mamdani failed to bench 135-pound barbell at Brooklyn Men's Day event.

Kuwait’s Communications and Information Technology Regulatory Authority (CITRA) has temporarily blocked the online game Roblox, following mounting public complaints and concerns for child safety. The action comes amid warnings from parents and public organizations about harmful content and unsafe practices impacting young users.CITRA exercised its regulatory powers to respond to urgent complaints from parents, educators, and public organizations who highlighted multiple risks on the Roblox platform. These reportedly include unsafe behavior, exposure to unwanted content, electronic exploitation, and risky in-game purchases. The platform’s popularity among children further heightened parental anxiety.Authorities found Roblox to provide an enabling environment for harassers and exploiters, in part due to its unrestricted chat and communications features. Concerns also include the presence of inappropriate themes, promotion of intellectual deviations, and content deemed inconsistent with Kuwait’s religious and moral values.The ban is described as temporary, pending:Several Gulf countries like Qatar, Oman and nations including China and Turkey have already enacted similar bans citing related concerns. This move reflects a wider trend across the Gulf and beyond, as governments seek stronger safeguards for minors in digital spaces.Kuwait’s temporary block of Roblox is a proactive response to ongoing public concern for child safety online.

Sharjah has welcomed a significant new addition to its architectural and religious landscape with the opening of the Quran Mosque in Aljada. Designed with both scale and simplicity in mind, the mosque reflects the emirate’s commitment to Islamic values, community well-being, and modern spiritual infrastructure.On the afternoon of August 21, 2025, H.H. Sheikh Sultan bin Ahmed Al Qasimi, Deputy Ruler of Sharjah and Chairman of Arada, officially inaugurated the Quran Mosque in the Aljada district. Following the opening ceremony, Sheikh Sultan led worshippers in the Dhuhr (midday) prayer, marking the mosque’s spiritual debut.The inauguration was attended by a number of high-level officials and dignitaries, including:Spanning 6,388 square metres, the Quran Mosque is one of the largest mosques in Sharjah and the first to be established in the Aljada community. Its design is notable for the absence of interior columns, creating an open and uninterrupted prayer space — a rare architectural feature that enhances both visibility and serenity.Key architectural and spatial features include:The mosque is topped with a circular central dome and a 39-metre-high minaret, blending minimalism with traditional Islamic aesthetics. The exterior is enhanced by elegant Arabic calligraphy, merging simplicity with visual sophistication.Beyond its architectural elegance, the Quran Mosque incorporates thoughtful facilities designed to support spiritual and communal life. These include:These features aim to create a welcoming and functional environment for both daily prayer and deeper spiritual engagement, serving both residents of Aljada and visitors to the area.During the opening, religious scholar Salem Al Doubi delivered a speech highlighting the mosque’s importance as a gathering place for worship and moral upliftment. He spoke on the spiritual rewards of building mosques and their role in promoting peace and unity among the faithful, describing them as ""houses of God"" with a central place in Islamic life.The Quran Mosque is not a standalone project. It marks the first of several mosques planned by Arada to meet the growing needs of the Aljada community. Two additional mosques are in development, forming part of a broader effort aligned with Sharjah’s long-term vision to expand access to places of worship across the emirate.","Sharjah has welcomed a significant new addition to its architectural and religious landscape with the opening of the Quran Mosque in Aljada.

In a defining moment at Expo 2025 Osaka, the UAE Pavilion has recorded over three million visitors since opening in April, solidifying its status as one of the most admired and frequently visited national pavilions at the global event.The UAE Pavilion at Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, has officially crossed the three-million visitor threshold — a milestone that reflects its broad international appeal, immersive experiences, and the compelling narrative it offers under the theme “Earth to Ether.”Opening its doors in mid-April 2025, the Pavilion has since established itself as a hub of dialogue, innovation, and cultural exchange. Visitors from around the world have been drawn to its engaging displays, sustainable architecture, and human-centric programming — all designed to reflect the UAE’s deep-rooted heritage and its ambitions for a globally inclusive and technologically progressive future.This landmark was marked on August 21st by a celebration on-site. The Pavilion team — including its Youth Ambassadors — welcomed guests with their hallmark hospitality, creating a moment of shared reflection and connection. These Youth Ambassadors have played an integral role in shaping the Pavilion experience, facilitating storytelling, encouraging cultural conversations, and leaving a meaningful impression on the millions of visitors who’ve walked through the Pavilion’s doors.Behind the Pavilion’s unique identity is its design, crafted by the Earth to Ether Design Collective — a collaboration of architects and creatives from the UAE, Japan, and other global partners. The structure is built with 90 architectural columns, inspired by the form and resilience of the date palm, and constructed using agricultural palm waste. This design not only pays homage to the UAE’s natural heritage but also embodies sustainable principles and an ethos of shared global progress.Inside, the Pavilion invites visitors on a journey across five thematic zones. Each space is thoughtfully curated to highlight key areas where the UAE is making bold strides, including:Interactive installations, sensory-driven storytelling, and a clear narrative flow allow visitors to explore these themes in a deeply engaging, memorable way.Beyond its architectural and thematic appeal, the UAE Pavilion has grown into a daily cultural destination within Expo 2025. Its dynamic programming includes:These daily activities draw both casual visitors and dedicated Expo participants, many of whom return for second or even third visits — a strong indicator of the Pavilion’s emotional and cultural impact.A notable highlight is the Pavilion’s food program. At the heart of it is Japan’s first-ever Emirati restaurant, located within the Pavilion, which has already attracted over 100,000 visitors. Traditional dishes such as lamb ouzi, loqaimat (sweet dumplings), and a signature drink made from camel milk, rehash, and toasted pistachio have offered Japanese and international guests a taste of Emirati hospitality and culinary tradition.In addition, summer culinary workshops for children and families have proven especially popular, with young Japanese participants learning the art of pastry-making under the guidance of Emirati chefs. These sessions not only share flavours but stories — offering a chance for participants to connect with Emirati culture through personal and sensory experiences.Commenting on the milestone, Shihab Alfaheem, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the UAE to Japan and Commissioner General of the UAE Pavilion, reflected on the significance of the Pavilion’s impact:“Reaching the three million mark is a huge milestone for the UAE Pavilion. It is a cherished achievement, and speaks to the global resonance of the UAE’s story and our shared aspirations for the future. Every visitor who walks through the Pavilion brings their own voice to our collective journey. Together, we are shaping a narrative that crosses borders, embraces diversity, and accelerates progress. With two months remaining, we want more guests to experience our pavilion. ”With Expo 2025 running until October 13, the Pavilion remains open and active — continuing to welcome visitors with the same warmth, curiosity, and openness that has defined its success so far.","The UAE Pavilion at Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, has officially crossed the three- million visitor threshold.

In a significant anti-narcotics operation, Abu Dhabi Police, in collaboration with the National Drug Control Service, have seized 377 kilograms of crystal meth and arrested three individuals. The suspects, Asian nationals, had attempted to conceal the drugs inside oil cans intended for sewing machines, deploying what authorities described as a ""sophisticated"" smuggling method. The bust not only highlights the vigilance of local law enforcement but also underscores the role of public reporting tools like the Aman Service in combating crime.Abu Dhabi Police announced the successful dismantling of a drug smuggling operation involving three Asian nationals who were found in possession of a large quantity of crystal methamphetamine, weighing a total of 377 kilograms. The operation was executed in coordination with the National Drug Control Service, reflecting a joint effort to target and eliminate narcotics trafficking in the region.According to Brigadier Taher Gharib Al Dhaheri, Director of the Anti-Narcotics Directorate at the Criminal Security Sector, the gang employed an unconventional concealment method by hiding the crystal meth inside oil cans manufactured for sewing machines.Authorities noted that this attempt to bypass detection systems demonstrated a high level of planning and ingenuity.However, the operation was foiled thanks to what Brig. Al Dhaheri described as the ""expertise and vigilance"" of the anti-narcotics teams. He emphasized that their ability to detect and intercept such a well-disguised cargo speaks to the strength of the emirate’s ongoing counter-narcotics strategy, which is supported by Abu Dhabi’s leadership and aligned with the national drug control agenda.After their arrest, the suspects were referred to the competent authority for legal proceedings.Alongside details of the bust, Abu Dhabi Police issued a strong public advisory warning residents not to fall prey to the common misconception that drug use leads to happiness or comfort. Brig. Al Dhaheri highlighted the serious negative effects of drug abuse, particularly its toll on personal health and public safety.Police reiterated that drugs, regardless of how they are presented or marketed by traffickers, carry grave health risks and contribute to broader social harm. They urged all community members to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity involving narcotics or related crimes.To support these efforts, the police pointed to the Aman Service, Abu Dhabi’s official platform for reporting cybercrimes and other serious offenses. Established in 2009, the Aman Service allows the public to confidentially share information related to security, cybercrimes, traffic incidents, and community threats.The service operates 24/7, year-round, and is not intended for filing police reports but specifically for providing intelligence or information that may help authorities prevent or investigate crimes.The Aman call centre supports Arabic, English, and Urdu, ensuring access for a wide range of residents. Authorities guarantee complete confidentiality for all individuals using the service to report criminal or suspicious activities.Residents are encouraged to use Aman to report incidents such as unauthorized access to personal accounts, blackmail, privacy violations, or the distribution of malicious content.","Gang hid 377kg of crystal meth inside oil cans made specifically for sewing machines, using them to bypass security detectors.

Mark Sewards, a British MP for Leeds South West and Morley, has launched an AI version of himself that responds to public complaints using his own voice.He introduced the digital assistant, ""AI Mark"", through his official X account.

A chatty parrot with a knack for drug slang has helped British police crack down on a prison drug ring, squawking its way into an unlikely role in a major narcotics bust, authorities revealed this week.The Lancashire Constabulary filed charges against 15 individuals connected to the gang, which purportedly distributed drugs across Blackpool, England, from February 2023 to July 2024. The operation was orchestrated by 35-year-old Adam Garnett whilst serving a prison sentence, Fox News reported.The case unfolded after prison staff discovered multiple mobile phones and Wi-Fi routers during a search of Garnett's cell. This finding led investigators to his alleged associates, including Dalbir Sandhu, Shannon Hilton and Jason Gerrand.Subsequent home searches revealed heroin, crack cocaine, ketamine, cannabis, substantial cash amounts and mobile phones connected to drug trafficking A notable discovery came from Hilton's phone, containing recordings of her parrot ""Mango"" repeating ""two for 25,"" believed to be drug transaction terminology.Additional footage showed the bird interacting with money allegedly obtained through illegal activities.Video:""What's the most talented thing your pet can do? Sit? Give paw? How about speak?"" Lancashire Police wrote in a post on the department's Facebook page.""One drug dealer's parrot learned to say 'two for 25' - a phrase picked up as part of common language used by the organised crime gang run by her boyfriend. Not a phrase you want your parrot squawking when the police come knocking!""Investigators uncovered video communications between Hilton and Garnett, including footage displaying kilogram-sized cocaine packages, occasionally accompanied by drug-referencing song lyrics.Despite his imprisonment, Garnett reportedly maintained central control, directing evidence concealment efforts and maintaining communication with virtually all network members.Det. Sgt. Anthony Alves of Lancashire Police's West Targeted Crime Team commended the results, describing it as a ""coordinated and complex drug operation that extended far beyond prison walls.""""Garnett continued to run his enterprise while incarcerated, using illegal devices to maintain control. I want to thank my team, our partners at the Crown Prosecution Service, and our prosecution team for their dedication to bringing these criminals to justice.""He noted that warrants remain active for Chloe Stott and Ryan Black, requesting public assistance in locating them.Police reported additional evidence from suspects' devices included videos displaying large cash sums, drug-themed rap lyrics and documented narcotic transactions.Garnett received an additional 19 years and six months imprisonment, consecutive to his existing 15-year sentence. Hilton, 29, received 12 years whilst Sandhu, 41, was given 10 years.The operation formed part of Operation Warrior, Lancashire Police's initiative targeting organised crime, drug trafficking, exploitation and violence. Police and Crime Commissioner Clive Grunshaw supported the initiative and praised the results.""This sends a clear message: we will not tolerate organized crime in our communities.

What critics say about Markle’s show

Positive buzz for Anderson

No reaction from Meghan





Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series. The former Baywatch star spoke about the issue on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. When Cohen asked her to rate, on a scale of one to ten, how much Markle’s With Love, Meghan looked like her own Pamela’s Cooking With Love, Anderson answered “One.” She added, “I didn’t invent cooking shows. She’s just doing her thing.”Fans noticed that both shows feature garden scenes, casual kitchen chats, and celebrity guests. Anderson’s trailer came out in October 2024. Markle’s teaser followed three months later. Online threads pointed to similar camera angles and even matching font styles in the titles. Some viewers accused the Duchess of releasing a “frame-for-frame” copy.Pamela’s Cooking With Love is streamed on Amazon Prime. Episodes show Anderson and a guest chef picking vegetables in her Vancouver garden before cooking a meal outdoors. Markle’s eight-part Netflix show centres on simple dishes and home-grown produce in Montecito.Both series mix recipes with lifestyle tips, but Anderson stressed that overlap is normal in food television.Anderson told Cohen she had only seen quick clips of Markle’s programme and did not spend time looking for likenesses. She joked that there is room for anyone who wants to share food and stories on screen. Her relaxed tone cooled much of the online debate.With Love, Meghan drew mixed-to-negative reviews (≈38% on Rotten Tomatoes; 37 on Metacritic). It briefly entered Netflix’s Top 10 in its first week, and mid-year engagement tallies cited by several outlets place it outside Netflix’s Top 300. Even so, Netflix has ordered Season 2.Anderson’s series has earned strong notices and a high user score on IMDb. Executive producer Jesse Fawcett said any comparison is a compliment because it proves their team set a trend others want to follow. Anderson plans to film a second garden season next spring.Markle has not commented on Anderson’s remarks. Sources close to her say she is focused on shooting new episodes and expanding her As Ever lifestyle brand. Observers doubt she will address copy-cat talk directly. They note she has stayed silent through similar critiques from Martha Stewart and Gwyneth Paltrow.Two stars can host cooking shows without a feud. Anderson’s light answer suggests she sees no threat. Unless Markle fires back, the story may cool as fast as it boiled up. For viewers, the choice is simple: prime-time garden meals with Pamela or California comfort food with Meghan. Either way, dinner is served.",Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.
