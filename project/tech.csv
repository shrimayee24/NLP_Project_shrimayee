"Be tough on Naxals but your actions should not alienate local people, Amit Shah tells jawans",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/be-tough-on-naxals-but-your-actions-should-not-alienate-local-people-amit-shah-tells-jawans/articleshow/116383282.cms,"BIJAPUR: All-terrain armoured trucks from which a dozen security personnel can fire medium machine guns (MMGs) at armed Naxalites while safely ensconced inside; sniper guns for all security camps; nets mounted on all built up structures in camps set up in ‘core’ Maoist areas to ‘catch’ grenades before they blow up on impact; and drones constantly surveying villages around the camps to track Maoist movements and manoeuvre live operations — these are some of the innovations and improvements that have brought a sharp 73% decline in fatalities among the counter-Naxal forces over the past 10 years.Home minister Amit Shah on Monday, during his visit to a CRPF security camp or forward operating base in Gundam village here, inspected these innovative solutions developed after studying 11 Naxal ambushes from the past and identifying the gaps that could have made the forces vulnerable. He also interacted with the jawans over lunch, besides visiting a nearby village to see how the development and welfare initiatives like free rations, schools, aanganwadi etc were being reached to locals residing around the camps.The CRPF camp at Gundam, Bijapur was established in February 2024 on what was once a prime training ground of Maoists and also the operational area of the PLGA’s dreaded ‘Battalion no. 1’. The sequence of the camps or forward operating bases (FOBs), which serve the dual purpose of pushing back Maoists from bastions like Bastar and enabling an administration and governance outreach in the surrounding villages, is carefully being planned to block all escape routes of Naxalites, said an officer.Advising jawans to adopt a differential approach towards armed Maoists and local villagers, Shah told them: “Be tough on Naxals but your actions should not alienate local people. You should help them in their basic needs like healthcare etc. Build a rapport with the locals and earn their trust”.An officer told TOI that the medical facility at the security camp is the most sought after by locals. “Our advanced life support ambulance deployed at the Gundam camp is like an easily accessible health centre for them. We attend to nearly 130 OPD cases per day,” said a CRPF officer.Elaborating on the strategy, weaponry and defence upgrade for the counter-Naxal forces, another senior officer told TOI that force-mutipliers like wheeled armed platform — the all-terrain, armoured truck that allows forces to fire from inside and which can withstand upto 100 kg IEDs, clear trees as it leads forces during operations, and run 40 km on all flat tyres — as well as drones developed indigenously, have helped jawans feel secure and confident as they target eliminating Left wing extremism by March 2026.Sources said sniper guns were recently procured for security camps at a cost of Rs 41 crore.The focus is equally on posting more personnel in LWE-affected for better administration. For instance, undivided Bastar had just 187 posts in the Eighties, but now a total 32,000 govt employees are posted in 7 districts of Bastar division.In the past five years, 289 camps have been set up, mostly in Bastar region. The camps and surrounding areas offer secure zones for local administration to work on development and welfare of the area. Electricity, roads, water, free rations that no longer need to be hauled over long distances, schools and aanganwadis have brought succour to villagers who were deprived of these basic facilities.","Home minister Amit Shah inspected innovative solutions developed after studying 11 Naxal ambushes from the past.

"How Indian teen rejected by Stanford is inspiring the internet: 'Tough loss, but ... '",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-indian-teen-rejected-by-stanford-is-inspiring-the-internet-tough-loss-but-/articleshow/116359947.cms,"Aaryan Singh Kushwah, a 17-year-old student shared three pictures on social media.

Rejection is a bitter pill to swallow, especially when it’s from a dream like Stanford University. For 17-year-old Indian entrepreneur Aaryan Singh Kushwah , the rejection letter didn’t mark the end of the road. Instead, it became a turning point, fueling his already extraordinary journey and sparking a viral discussion on how failure often lays the foundation for success.Kushwah recently shared his “bittersweet” moment on social media, posting the rejection email alongside two snapshots of his entrepreneurial milestones.Despite Stanford’s denial, his achievements speak volumes. His venture hit an impressive 220,000 users, recorded over 2 million impressions in a single day, and secured a $10,000 emergent grant. In his post, he reflected, “Tough loss but gotta come back stronger. Grateful I had the opportunity to apply, grateful I felt badly about the loss. All in God’s glory.”The rejection letter, signed by Richard H Shaw, dean of admission and financial aid at Stanford, acknowledged the competitiveness of the admissions process and Kushwah’s exceptional application. Though it was a polite “no,” Kushwah’s story resonated deeply online, inspiring conversations about resilience and redefining success.Social media exploded with reactions. Many praised Kushwah’s ability to channel disappointment into motivation. One user wrote, “God’s got a plan for you, man. Don’t lose momentum, keep on going.” Another chimed in, “Failure teaches you better lessons than any university. Good luck!”Some saw the rejection as a blessing in disguise. “It’s all part of a bigger plan,” commented one supporter, while another encouraged him to try again: “The application process is overwhelming, but it teaches you so much. You’ve got this if you try again next year!”A cheeky commenter joked, “You mean you already dropped out of Stanford? Congrats! Looks like it’s going well for you already.”Kushwah’s story stands as a testament to resilience. While his dream of studying at Stanford is deferred, his entrepreneurial journey is soaring—and proving that success isn’t always found in Ivy League halls. Instead, it often emerges from grit, determination, and the courage to keep going.","Aaryan Singh Kushwah, a 17-year-old student shared three pictures on social media.

Is Netflix over Harry and Meghan? 'Exhausted' execs pin hopes on Sussexes’ cookery show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/is-netflix-over-harry-and-meghan-exhausted-execs-pin-hopes-on-sussexes-cookery-show/articleshow/116359484.cms,"As per the sources, Netflix executives are “exhausted” from working with Markle.

Polo flops and “box office poison” drama

Cookery show under pressure

The Sussex struggle: From Hollywood darlings to “colossal bombs”

Crisis control or end of the road?

It seems like the honeymoon phase between Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, and Netflix is officially over. Once hailed as the streaming platform’s dream duo, the Sussexes’ partnership with Netflix has hit a rough patch, with insiders whispering about mounting frustration and dwindling faith in their ability to deliver hits.The latest debacle? Their five-part documentary about polo, which critics have torched as a “tedious inside look” and a “dull indulgence.” One reviewer even joked it felt like a spoof designed to play in the background of Succession.As per the sources quoted by the Daily Mail, Netflix executives are “exhausted” from working with Markle. The fallout is apparently so bad that her upcoming cookery show—still without a premiere date—is being labeled as her “make or break” moment. “It’s so much work with her, and, bluntly, the ‘deliverable’ does not seem to be worth it,” one insider said.Adding fuel to the fire, there’s been zero buzz around the polo series. No press tours, no promotional events, no hype. Even Nacho Figueras, Harry’s polo pal and a star of the series, has barely mentioned it on social media. Hollywood veteran Sean McNulty told The Daily Beast: “The lack of a proper press campaign for a Harry and Meghan project is eyebrow-raising, to say the least.”According to reports, Meghan’s cookery show is now the Sussexes’ last hope at staying in Netflix’s good graces. One entertainment exec was quotes by the Daily Mail as saying, “Her show will have to be an enormous hit to turn around their deal and their reputations in this town.”The show is expected to drop in early 2024, coinciding with Harry’s appearance at the Winter Invictus Games in Canada and the launch of Meghan’s homeware brand, American Riviera Orchard . Talk about multitasking under pressure.Critics are having a field day with Harry and Meghan’s current reputation—or lack thereof. Marketing expert Tony Case didn’t mince words, was quoted by the Daily Beast as saying, “Harry and Meghan are box office poison. Everyone is running away from this colossal bomb.”He added, “They set out to conquer America, but no one here found them—or what they’re selling—to be particularly compelling.”Even their highly-publicized project Meet Me at the Lake, based on a best-selling novel, remains in limbo. With no production in sight, it’s unlikely to materialize before their Netflix deal is up for renewal next year.Friends who once hyped their projects are unusually quiet, fueling speculation that Hollywood may be losing patience with the couple. A source quoted in Closer Magazine tried to defend the Sussexes, blaming Netflix for pushing a “reality TV angle” that was out of their control.","The Sussexes’ partnership with Netflix has hit a rough patch, with insiders whispering about mounting frustration and dwindling faith in their ability to deliver hits. “It’s so much work with her, and, bluntly, the ‘deliverable’ does not seem to be worth it,” one insider said.

A woman in southwestern China won 10,000 yuan (Rs 1, 16,000) from a competition for abstaining from mobile phone use for eight hours while exhibiting no signs of anxiety.The contest took place at a shopping centre in Chongqing municipality on November 29, as reported by Jimu News.Ten contestants, selected from 100 applicants, were invited to the mall to participate in the competition, which required them to spend eight hours on a designated new bed. Before the contest, they surrendered their mobile phones and were prohibited from using any other electronic devices, including iPads and laptops, the South China Morning Post reported.In emergency situations, participants could use older mobile phone models with only calling capabilities, provided by the competition organisers, to contact their families.They were also required to adhere to a bed restriction rule, which allowed them to leave the bed for toilet breaks, but limited them to a maximum of five minutes each time.The organisers set a quota for the total amount of time contestants could be away from their beds throughout the eight-hour period, although this detail was not disclosed in the news report.Drinks and meals were provided, and participants were instructed to consume them in bed.In addition to being prohibited from using their mobile phones, competitors were not allowed to fall into a deep sleep or exhibit anxiety. They wore wrist straps to monitor their sleep quality and anxiety levels.Most contestants spent their time reading books or simply resting with their eyes closed.Ultimately, after verification by event officials, a woman surnamed Dong was declared the champion, achieving a comprehensive score of 88.99 out of 100. The organisers noted that she spent the longest time in bed, did not experience deep sleep, and displayed the lowest level of anxiety.The 10,000-yuan prizewinner donned pyjamas for the competition, earning her the nickname “pyjama sister” on mainland social media as the no-mobile-phone race gained viral attention online.Dong is a sales manager at a finance firm. In her spare time, she typically tutors her child and rarely browses her mobile phone aimlessly.The identity of the company sponsoring the competition and the purpose behind holding this event, which occurred in a mattress and bedding shop within the mall, remains undisclosed.","A woman in southwestern China won 10,000 yuan (Rs 1, 16,000) from a competition for abstaining from mobile phone use for eight hours.

The green card dilemma

The complexities of the US immigration system came under the spotlight once again when Indian-origin entrepreneur Aravind Srinivas , the CEO of AI search engine Perplexity AI, posed a simple yet thought-provoking question on X (formerly Twitter): “I think I should get a green card . Wdyt?”This wasn’t just an idle query. Srinivas, a graduate of IIT Madras and PhD holder from UC Berkeley, revealed that he has been waiting for his green card for three years. Known for his sharp and concise remarks, billionaire Elon Musk replied to the post with a straightforward “Yes.” The exchange quickly gained traction, with netizens, industry leaders, and Musk’s followers weighing in on the broader issue of US immigration policies.Srinivas is a highly accomplished individual, co-founding Perplexity AI in 2022 alongside Andy Konwinski, Denis Yarats, and Johnny Ho. The search engine, backed by prominent investors like Jeff Bezos, uses artificial intelligence to transform information retrieval. Srinivas, an IIT Madras alumnus with a PhD from UC Berkeley, began his career as a research intern at OpenAI and later held roles at Google and DeepMind before returning to OpenAI as a research scientist.Despite these accomplishments, his green card status remains in limbo.His post, “I think I should get a green card. Wdyt?”, resonated with many, especially in the tech and immigrant communities. Musk’s one-word reply, “Yes,” added fuel to the conversation. Srinivas responded with a red heart and folded hands emoji, thanking Musk.But this wasn’t their first interaction on the topic. Days earlier, Srinivas had lamented his prolonged wait for permanent residency, saying, “I have been waiting for my green card for like the last 3 years. Still haven’t gotten it. People mostly have no idea when they talk about immigration.”In response, Musk offered a sharp critique of the US immigration system: “We have an upside-down system that makes it difficult for highly skilled individuals to enter the US legally, while it’s almost effortless for criminals to do so illegally. Why is it easier for a murderer to cross the border unlawfully than for a Nobel Laureate to enter legally?”The billionaire tagged former President Donald Trump and referenced “DOGE” as part of his commentary, further adding to the drama.Srinivas’ plight struck a chord online, with users voicing their frustrations about the cumbersome immigration process. One user wrote: “At minimum, the US should make EB-1A cap exempt/unlimited in number. Would at least go towards solving the issue that the small set of highly skilled people don’t need to wait irrespective of their country of birth.”Another commented: “Aravind, the fact that you don’t have one yet, just shows how broken the immigration system is. I’m hopeful 2025 will be the year.”Some responses questioned the value of US residency altogether, with one user stating: “Why? You’ll have to pay a ton of taxes forever, and the USD is about to collapse. The smart are denouncing their citizenships.”Srinivas himself has previously called for streamlining the immigration process. Last month, he suggested leveraging technology to expedite applications: “Excited for Elon (Musk) and Vivek (Ramaswamy) to make legal immigration better. I would even push for a higher application fee (e.g., 2x) in exchange for high-quality fast service. Think about immigration to America as you investing in the country.”He proposed a system where applicants could upload documents through a mobile app, pay via Apple Pay, schedule interviews within a week, and receive results within a month.A green card, officially termed a Permanent Resident Card, allows foreign nationals to live and work in the United States indefinitely. While it grants significant advantages—such as job flexibility, access to social benefits, and ease of travel—the path to obtaining one is fraught with delays and bureaucratic hurdles.","Aravind Srinivas, the CEO of AI search engine Perplexity AI, posed a simple yet thought-provoking question on X (formerly Twitter): “I think I should get a green card.

Adult star Lily Phillips , originally from Derbyshire, became a TikTok sensation in October after engaging in an extreme challenge—sleeping with 101 men in a single day. However, in new footage, she described the experience as ""intense"" and admitted she is uncertain whether she would recommend it to others.The 23-year-old, who has earned £2 million through OnlyFans , shared her emotional reflection in a documentary by YouTuber Josh Pieters titled ""I Slept With 100 Men in One Day"".Despite previously expressing enthusiasm for the challenge and her work, the behind-the-scenes footage shows a different side, with Lily visibly shaken and in tears.Speaking through tears, she told Pieters, ""It’s not for the weak girls, if I’m honest – it was hard. I don’t know if I’d recommend it. It’s a different feeling. It’s just one in, one out; it feels intense."" When asked if the experience was more overwhelming than she anticipated, she confirmed: ""Definitely.""Lily announced a plan to sleep with 1,000 men in one day. This announcement has caused public discussion. Some people want OnlyFans, the platform where the content would appear, to be banned. Despite the personal cost, Lily ""expressed interest in attempting an even larger challenge—sleeping with 1,000 men in a single day.""One social media user wrote, ""Lily Phillips reflects on her sadness after sleeping with 100 guys in 1 day – 1) she’s responsible for her own behaviour in this sick stunt, 2) it’s also clear OF has turned women into plastic dolls – and the 'models' themselves have bought this heartbreaking lie. BAN ONLYFANS NOW."" The tweet has since amassed over 7.7 million views and 19,000 likes.Critics claim the footage highlights the damaging impact of OnlyFans, with one commenting, ""Lily Phillips talking about how traumatic it is to sleep with 100 men is exactly why we should be against OnlyFans."" Another said, ""Look at this woman’s eyes. She has degraded herself so badly for validation. I pray she reflects on this stunt and sees her own intrinsic value. OnlyFans is making this possible, and it needs banning.""However, not everyone agrees that the platform should be banned. Some empathised with Lily, with one user writing, ""Poor girl. She needs a big hug."" Others argued she made her own choices, with one person stating, ""She chose to do this and profit from it. Are we supposed to feel sorry for her?""Supporters of OnlyFans contend the issue is more nuanced. ""OnlyFans isn’t inherently good or bad. Society needs to get better at dealing with it. Banning is very rarely, if ever, the answer,"" one user argued.","Adult star Lily Phillips became a TikTok sensation in October after engaging in an extreme challenge.

"'No burgers, soft drinks and burgers': UK bans daytime TV ads for junk food in bid to tackle child obesity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/no-burgers-soft-drinks-and-burgers-uk-bans-daytime-tv-ads-for-junk-food-in-bid-to-tackle-child-obesity/articleshow/116004661.cms,"Rising child obesity in UK

What will be covered in the ambit of the ban?

The UK government has announced a ban on daytime TV adverts for sugary foods, including popular items like granola, muffins, and pastries, as part of its ongoing efforts to combat rising childhood obesity.News agency AFP reported that the new regulations, set to take effect in October next year, will restrict ads for “less healthy” food and drinks to airing only after the 9:00 pm watershed.The ban targets specific products identified as unhealthy based on their sugar, fat, and salt content, but does not apply to the broader advertising of fast food chains. For example, ads from fast food restaurants will remain permissible as long as they do not feature specific items like burgers or fries, according to a BBC report.Highlighting the importance of these measures, health secretary Wes Streeting said, “Obesity robs our kids of the best possible start in life, sets them up for a lifetime of health problems, and costs the NHS billions. This government is taking action now to end the targeting of junk food ads at kids, across both TV and online.”According to the National Health Service (NHS), obesity rates among children in the UK are on the rise, with one in 10 four-year-olds now classified as obese. Additionally, one in five five-year-olds suffers from tooth decay linked to excessive sugar consumption. The government’s new approach aims to address these alarming statistics and prevent further health complications down the line.The ban includes a variety of items that are commonly marketed to children, such as fast food, soft drinks, ready meals, and pre-packaged sugary breakfast foods. Products like croissants, pancakes, waffles, cereal bars, and sweetened yoghurts will be affected, alongside chickpea or lentil-based crisps, seaweed snacks, energy drinks, and processed foods like hamburgers and chicken nuggets.However, healthier alternatives will be exempt from the restrictions. Natural porridge oats and unsweetened yoghurt, for instance, will not fall under the new rules.The government hopes that by reducing the exposure of children to these adverts, it can help prevent an estimated 20,000 cases of childhood obesity each year.","The UK government has announced a ban on daytime TV adverts for sugary foods.

Shared love for animals

Middleton family’s competitive spirit

Prince William has revealed a unique way to avoid the ""fiercely competitive"" atmosphere of the Middleton family's game nights, taking James Middleton 's beloved dog, Ella, for a walk.As noted in James’ book, ‘Meet Ella: The Dog Who Saved My Life’, Ella offered the Prince of Wales the perfect excuse to step away from the fast-paced card game Racing Demon.James wrote, “Ella gave him a perfect excuse to avoid the fiercely competitive atmosphere of the Middleton household, especially during our favourite fast-paced card game, Racing Demon.”Royal expert Christopher Andersen echoed this sentiment, saying that William and Kate Middleton’s card games are “intense and all-consuming,” often prompting William to look for ways to steer clear of the competitive streak that runs deep in the Middleton family.However, away from these heated games, William reportedly has no hesitation in challenging Kate in private competitions.As per RadarOnline, James Middleton shared insights on The Dog podcast, describing William’s lighthearted approach to the family games. He noted that William would often ask, “James, does Ella need a walk?” before the game even began, much to the knowing amusement of the Middleton siblings.James wrote in his memoir that William, despite his rigorous military training, was ""thrilled to be the first out of the game"" and would happily retreat to cuddle Ella once eliminated.William’s affection for animals has been a longstanding trait.According to People.com, William grew up surrounded by dogs and shared this love with his late grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and his maternal grandmother, Frances Shand Kydd.While William hesitated to get another dog after losing a beloved pet in his youth, Kate encouraged him to welcome Lupo, a black cocker spaniel, into their family in 2011.The Wales family welcomed a new cocker spaniel named Orla in 2020. James Middleton bred the dog. This followed the death of their previous dog, Lupo.James reflected on how William has become an integral part of the Middleton family, telling People that the Prince has been “fantastic in offering advice and support” and fully embraces his role as both a family member and future king.James added, “William has no qualms about taking part in our family traditions , even if he’s more comfortable cheering from the sidelines.”Christopher Andersen, speaking to Fox News Digital, explained that competition runs deep in royal and Middleton families alike.He noted that the late Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip enjoyed spirited contests, while King Charles III’s passion for polo often led to injuries.However, the Middleton family’s drive to win appears unmatched. James confirmed this sentiment, adding that his paternal grandmother would ""thrash"" them at Racing Demon well into her eighties.Kate, who shares her family’s love for games, also highlighted this competitive spirit in a touching September video about completing her chemotherapy. In the message, she revealed how playing card games with her family had provided moments of normalcy during her recovery.Despite the high-energy dynamic of these gatherings, William’s bond with his in-laws remains strong.As James Middleton shared with Hello! magazine, “William has been fantastic in integrating into our family, and we’re proud to have him as part of our lives.”","Prince William has revealed a unique way to avoid the ""fiercely competitive"" atmosphere of the Middleton family's game nights.

Is this Luigi Mangione skateboarding?

Viral footage leaves netizens floored

A viral video that surfaced on social media , claiming to show Luigi Mangione , the prime suspect in the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO , skateboarding, has left the internet buzzing. The video, shared on X (formerly Twitter) on December 16, 2024, shows a man in a black jacket and blue denim skateboarding across a parking lot. In the clip, the individual performs an impressive jump over a medium-height fence, and the post quickly gained traction.The same video was shared by a different account on social media, which labeled the footage ""incredible skateboarding skills"" by Mangione. The caption read, ""Cultural Touchstone Luigi Mangione stuns in newly discovered footage displaying his incredible skateboarding skills! This claim prompted thousands of comments from users who were either impressed by Mangione’s apparent talent or baffled by his newfound fame. Some netizens expressed astonishment, claiming that the 26-year-old suspect’s skills rivaled those of professional skateboarders.""Bro is gaining aura every day, sigh,"" one user commented, while another wrote, ""HOW DOES HE KEEP GETTING COOLER BRO?"" Some even speculated that Mangione’s skateboarding abilities were as good as a professional’s. ""This is professional skater stuff,"" one user remarked. Others joked about Mangione’s ""master skills"" in various areas of life, despite the serious charges against him.However, the viral video was soon debunked by X's Community Notes , which clarified that the man in the video was not Luigi Mangione. The footage actually featured professional skateboarder Guy Azulay , not Mangione. Azulay’s Instagram account, which posted the original video days before it was shared on X, confirmed the identity of the skateboarder. The video, filmed by Trevor Dare, had also been misattributed to Mangione by many viewers who had been drawn into the online frenzy.Despite the revelation, the video continued to spread as several Instagram users mistakenly believed it featured Mangione, leaving comments under the post that joked about Luigi’s ""side quest"" in skateboarding. Azulay’s post garnered significant attention, accumulating over 76K likes. While some fans were initially confused, they quickly realized their mistake and laughed off the blunder.The viral video is just the latest in a series of online phenomena surrounding Mangione, who became an internet sensation after his arrest on December 9, 2024, in connection with the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO. Following the arrest, internet sleuths eagerly dug into Mangione’s personal life, finding a flood of supposed details about his past and speculating about his future. The skateboarding clip was yet another twist in the ongoing saga of public fascination with Mangione.As the video continues to circulate, there remains an ongoing debate about how to view Mangione in light of his alleged crime. Some netizens expressed discomfort with the glorification of a suspect in a murder case. ""Stop glorifying a murderer,"" one user commented, while another expressed their uncertainty, ""I’m not sure if we are supposed to support or not support him."" Others, however, chose to focus on the entertainment aspect of the video, joking about Mangione’s ""talent"" while ignoring his alleged actions.Despite the confusion, the video was ultimately not related to the serious charges Mangione faces for the assassination of the UnitedHealthcare CEO.","A viral video claiming to show Luigi Mangione skateboarding has left the internet buzzing.

A political statement on a deck of cards

Public reaction: Polarizing and viral

Harr’s defense: Call to action

A dangerous trend?

Days after the shocking fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Midtown Manhattan, a socialist fashion brand has ignited fresh controversy with a provocative new product. Comrade Workwear , founded by James Harr, has announced a set of “most wanted CEOs” playing cards, featuring names, photos, and scathing critiques of top executives across industries.Harr’s move taps into a growing anti-corporate sentiment in the US, amplified by the rise of Luigi Mangione , Thompson’s alleged killer, who has been both vilified and celebrated online for his purported “anti-corporatist” motivations. The card deck, Harr explained on social media, aims to expose the executives profiting from what he described as the “daily violence” inflicted on the working class by corporate decision-making.Inspired by the infamous “most-wanted Iraqi” playing cards distributed during the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, Harr’s deck divides CEOs into four suits, each representing a specific sector. Clubs include pharmaceutical executives , Hearts target leaders in real estate and retail, Diamonds highlight tech, finance, and media moguls, while Spades call out figures in oil and defense industries.In an eyebrow-raising twist, each card features a QR code linking to information about what makes the CEOs “evil,” according to Harr’s TikTok posts. Pre-orders for the cards are set to go live within days, and Harr has even asked his followers to suggest additional names for the lineup.The playing cards have sparked a firestorm on social media. Some users are hailing the deck as a clever critique of corporate greed, while others have slammed it as dangerous and irresponsible. One commenter even asked if the cards would include the CEOs’ addresses, while others proposed creating a “good guy” deck celebrating individuals like Mangione.Meanwhile, corporations are scrambling to mitigate the fallout. UnitedHealthcare and other major companies have reportedly begun erasing the names of their executives from websites amid growing security concerns. The aftermath of Thompson’s killing has already led to a surge in online threats, raising questions about the ethical boundaries of anti-corporate activism.Though Harr declined to speak with major outlets, he addressed the controversy in a video on Comrade Workwear’s social platforms. “The media wants us to condemn the assassination of a healthcare CEO, but they won’t acknowledge the daily violence the working class suffers,” he said.Harr insisted that the cards are not an incitement to violence but a tool for awareness. “I’m not suggesting anyone should harm anyone, but people need to know who is making their lives harder. These cards are a way to bond over our shared struggles as workers and understand who profits from our suffering,” he added.Critics argue that Harr’s playing cards escalate an already volatile situation. The surge of “wanted” posters targeting CEOs, combined with the glamorization of Thompson’s killer, has raised fears of copycat incidents.For now, the controversy continues to swirl, with Harr’s cards poised to become a flashpoint in America’s ongoing debate over corporate accountability and class struggle. Whether they’ll serve as a rallying cry for change or fuel an already divided public remains to be seen.","Comrade Workwear, founded by James Harr, has announced a set of “most wanted CEOs” playing cards.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

The dispute centers on Qualcomm's 2021 acquisition of chip designer Nuvia and the licensing of Arm's chip architecture.The case revolves around Qualcomm's use of Nuvia technology in its Snapdragon processors for PCs, phones, and cars. These processors have been adopted by major companies like Samsung, Microsoft, and Dell.While Arm, backed by SoftBank , has alleged that Qualcomm failed to obtain the necessary consent to transfer Nuvia's license after the acquisition, Qualcomm, a major Arm customer, has maintained that its existing license covers the use of Arm’s technology in Nuvia’s designs.Arm sued Qualcomm marking the first time in Arm's 34-year history that it has taken legal action against a customer, exposing its typically confidential licensing agreements to public scrutiny. Qualcomm, no stranger to intellectual property disputes, has argued that Arm is using this lawsuit to leverage higher royalty rates and interfere with its product roadmap.Rather than seeking monetary damages, Arm is asking the court to order Qualcomm to destroy products found to infringe on its intellectual property. Arm has even threatened to terminate Qualcomm's license entirely, a move that could have significant consequences for both companies.This trial comes at a critical time for both Arm and Qualcomm, as they seek to expand their reach in new markets, particularly in the booming field of artificial intelligence (AI).Notably, Nuvia was co-founded by former top Apple chip designer Gerard Williams, who is now employed as a senior engineer at Qualcomm.

Apple AirTag 2 may get ‘new’ chip: What this means for users,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-airtag-2-may-get-new-chip-what-this-means-for-users/articleshow/116372550.cms,"How Apple AirTag 2’s UWB chip will help users



Apple's next-generation AirTag tracker, rumoured to be called AirTag 2, is expected to launch soon with a new ultrawide-band (UWB) chip similar to the one found in the iPhone 15. This updated chip is likely to improve the tracker's accuracy and range. While Apple has not officially confirmed the new AirTag, rumours suggest it will come with several improvements over the original model, which was introduced in 2021.According to the Power On newsletter by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the upcoming AirTag 2 is expected to feature a new ultrawide-band (UWB) chip. If the rumours are to be true, this new chip will replace the one found in the current model. This updated chip is also reportedly on par with the UWB chip introduced in the iPhone 15.Gurman suggests that the new UWB chip will significantly extend the Precision Finding range in the second-generation AirTag, making it easier to locate items. Currently, AirTags can locate attached items within a range of 10 to 30 meters, depending on conditions. With the rumoured UWB chip, this range could potentially triple, offering a significant improvement in tracking capabilities.Apple’s iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 models feature a tool named Precision Finding, which allows users to locate friends in crowded areas with a range of up to nearly 60 meters (around 200 feet). The new AirTag is also expected to offer a similar range.Another report which was shared by Gurman earlier claimed that Apple is expected to release the AirTag 2 around mid-2025, likely between June and July. The upcoming smart tracker codenamed B589, is rumoured to feature a design similar to the current model but with enhanced privacy features.Since the launch of the first-generation AirTag, concerns about misuse for stalking have arisen. In response, Apple is anticipated to introduce privacy-focused updates in the AirTag 2, aiming to make it more tamper-proof. Additionally, the company is reportedly planning to launch a new smart home display alongside the second-generation AirTag.","The AirTag 2 is expected to feature a new ultrawide-band (UWB) chip.

Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test

A Public Breakup That Shook Social Media



“God, I think that put things in full perspective… Social media, words on the internet and experiences like this put life into perspective.”

It’s Not Just a Show of “Physical Endurance” for Her



“I would say I’m the opposite of being afraid of what people are going to see. I’m actually excited for people to see us stripped down, raw, vulnerable,” she said, emphasizing the importance of letting people see celebrities as human beings with real emotions.

Trollers didn’t make it Easy for her



""It has nothing to do with me. I think that there's something about that level of fame that attracts crazy people. It's unfortunate because I've never done anything to warrant that kind of backlash.""

The Next Big Chapter



Breakups are never easy, especially when the whole world is watching. That's what model and influencer Kayla Nicole must have realized after her recent public break-up with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce . As she is about to face another daunting challenge by appearing on the show—she has come to share the ways through which her breakup and media blitz surrounding it prepared her to face some of the biggest battles that life had for her to face both in and off-camera.Let's rewind a little bit. Kayla and Travis did break up almost two years ago, but all rumors about their relationship seemed like they never stopped getting published. It got worse when Kelce went steady with Taylor Swift last quarter of 2023 thrusting Kayla further and deeper into a spotlight she didn’t ask for.. Social media trolls? Yep, they came out in full force, but Kayla’s taking it all in stride.She recently told Page Six at the red carpet premiere of Special Forces in Los Angeles:The season of Special Forces: World's Toughest Test will start on January 8, 2025. Kayla is more than ready to show the world who she really is—raw, real, and unfiltered. For her, this isn't about tough physical tasks; it's a chance to get rid of the labels and be seen for who she truly is.The preview clip of the show made Kayla emotional while speaking on the break-up, overwhelmed by the experience as the world witnessed it happen to her. Speaking with other contestants, she discussed the fact that it wasn't easy to handle as each moment was scrutinized in public.Kayla hasn't been afraid to speak out about the negativity she's received. On WNBA star Angel Reese's podcast, Unapologetically Angel, she spoke about the harsh comments she's received since Kelce's relationship with Swift became public.Despite everything, Kayla is being wise and earthy. Trolls will try to define her worth, but she is not letting them win.Alongside other stars like Brody Jenner, Denise Richards, and Cam Newton, Kayla is ready to take on the mental and physical challenges of Special Forces. Set in Wales, the series will test the contestants’ endurance with extreme tasks like ocean warfare and high-pressure rescue operations. Kayla sees this as a transformative opportunity:“I’m excited about that element [of] allowing us to be humans.”“I think people in general, the general public, need to be reminded that we’re all humans, right? We all have very real emotions. And I’m excited about that element [of] allowing us to be humans.”Right at the heel of its first premiere on January 8, Kayla Nicole has emerged again—this time, as someone not stepping out of their exes' shoes, but more so, stepping out with her fighting shoes.Also read - NFL Week 15 Rankings: Detroit’s Downfall, Eagles Take NFL Top Spot After Lions’ Streak Ends","Kayla Nicole is set to appear on Special Forces: World's Toughest Test.
