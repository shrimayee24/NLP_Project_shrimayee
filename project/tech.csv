Kylie Kelce, wife to Jason Kelce and host of the Not Gonna Lie podcast, might wear many hats– mom, advocate, podcaster– but she proudly wears one more: germaphobe. On her July 31 episode, she opened up about one of motherhood’s most chaotic challenges– navigating public restrooms with toddlers– and her quirky, effective solution to staying clean. As it turns out, her life behind the scenes is both relatable and wildly entertaining.It takes a certain kind of brilliance to keep kids from turning a public bathroom into their personal playground– and Kylie has mastered it. Sharing an anecdote from one of her many chaotic mom moments, she revealed, ""Someone actually giggled at me once because they heard the narration of me in a (bathroom) stall with all three of my young children.""Any parent knows the horror of trying to maintain hygiene when tiny hands are eager to touch everything– from the sticky floor to the toilet bowl itself. That’s where Kylie’s unique tactic shines. ""My tactic in a public restroom is, 'Hands on your head!' And you will hear me say it at least 30 times for the exact reason you think,"" she explained. It's funny, relatable, and undeniably smart. She doesn’t trust public toilets–“there’s no lids to the toilets in public restrooms, so every time the toilet flushes… I can’t.Kylie’s germ-consciousness doesn’t stop at public restrooms–it’s woven into her everyday life. She trains her kids to wash hands as soon as they return home, avoids people sneezing near food, and even refuses to touch chips with unwashed hands–she just tips the bag into her mouth.And yes, there’s even a peanut butter protocol in the Kelce household. To avoid “cross-contamination” between jelly and peanut butter, Kylie’s labeled a separate jar for her husband. ""It literally says 'Jason' on the top of the lid because he does sometimes dip the jelly knife into the peanut butter,"" she said, explaining how that leaves jelly at room temperature– “Ew. You get what I'm saying. It's gross.”For Kylie Kelce, being a germaphobe isn’t just a quirk–it’s a survival strategy. And honestly? Moms everywhere are taking notes.Kylie Kelce is a philanthropist, podcast host, and the wife of former NFL star Jason Kelce.The couple has four daughters: fWyatt, Elliotte, Bennett and Finnley.They met on Tinder in 2014, met at a bar after an Eagles Christmas party and exchanged vows on April 14, 2018, at the Logan Hotel in Philadelphia.Also Read: Carrie Underwood’s fate with ‘Sunday Night Football’ revealed as NBC makes important announcement fans waited for","Kylie Kelce is the host of the Not Gonna Lie podcast.

Small business boom expected as AI democratises enterprise tools



Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff rejects the predictions of widespread job displacement from artificial intelligence , arguing that AI agents augment rather than replace human workers, even as his company automates up to 50% of internal work through AI technology. Speaking to Fortune during a recent London visit, Benioff directly challenged prominent AI executives like Anthropic's Dario Amodei who have warned of massive white-collar job losses. ""I keep looking around, talking to CEOs, asking: what AI are they using for these big layoffs?"" Benioff said. ""I think AI augments people, but I don't know if it necessarily replaces them.""The tech CEO’s comments come as Salesforce has emerged as the most aggressive adopter of AI agents in corporate America, with the technology now handling 85% of customer service inquiries and qualifying sales leads 40% faster than human workers.Despite the dramatic efficiency gains, Marc Benioff emphasised AI's limitations prevent complete automation. ""The thing about the AI we have, it's not 100% accurate because it's built on word models,"" he explained to Fortune. ""When you add in our data set, we're getting 90% accuracy, but it's not 100%. So you need the human in the loop.""This accuracy gap has practical implications across industries. ""Every AI needs its own fact checker, and those fact checkers are humans, not AIs, because AIs can't fact check because they don't have that level of accuracy,"" Marc Benioff noted.The Salesforce CEO described his relationship with AI as a partnership, using it to review business plans and identify gaps in strategic thinking. ""Every AI needs its own fact checker, and those fact checkers are humans, not AIs,"" Benioff concluded, reinforcing his view that human oversight remains indispensable in an AI-augmented workplace.Rather than mass unemployment, Benioff predicts AI will spawn new business creation . ""There's going to potentially be a lot more employment because everybody is augmented and has the ability to do more,"" he told Fortune. ""I think there's going to be an explosion of small and medium businesses because they can do more, it's easier to start one, you can create value more easily.""While Salesforce has frozen hiring for engineers, support staff, and lawyers, the company continues recruiting salespeople and customer success employees to help clients adopt AI technology.","Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff rejects the predictions of widespread job displacement from artificial intelligence.

MrBeast’s journey from YouTuber to billionaire entrepreneur

YouTube sensation Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast, has set a historic milestone by becoming the first individual creator to surpass 400 million subscribers on his main channel. According to Forbes report, world’s richest content creator MrBeast’s position achieved on June 1, 2025, this feat cements as one of the most influential digital creators worldwide. To celebrate, YouTube awarded him a unique Play Button trophy, specially designed to mark this unprecedented achievement. However, while fans praised his incredible success, the trophy design sparked controversy online, with many calling it uninspired and even “AI-generated” in appearance. The debate has raised questions about YouTube’s creativity in its awards, overshadowing what is otherwise one of the biggest milestones in digital content history.MrBeast’s channel, known for its large-scale challenges, philanthropy, and viral social experiments, has dominated YouTube for years. Surpassing 400 million subscribers places him far ahead of T-Series, which currently holds 299 million. Celebrating the milestone, MrBeast shared an emotional note, recalling how he was once discouraged from pursuing content creation:“A decade ago everyone told me I was too obsessed and would never make it.I loved making content so much I told my mom I’d rather be homeless than do anything else. Thanks to YouTube and you guys, I now have a purpose every single day.”To celebrate the milestone, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan personally handed MrBeast a custom-designed Play Button. Unlike traditional Gold or Diamond buttons, this award features a metallic frame with a rare blue gemstone centerpiece, symbolizing the uniqueness of this achievement. MrBeast proudly shared the picture of his award with the caption:This marks the first time YouTube has created a personalised award for an individual creator, underscoring how MrBeast has become the face of creator culture worldwide.While fans praised MrBeast’s achievement, many were critical of the trophy’s design. Some argued it looked like a repainted version of previous awards, while others felt YouTube could have made something more iconic. A Reddit user commented: “This looks like they made one just for the sake of it.”Another added: “It’s just a 10 million button with a blue center.”A few fans defended YouTube, pointing out that the blue centerpiece might be crafted from precious materials like lapis lazuli or azurite, but the overall sentiment leaned toward disappointment, with some calling it “AI-generated” in design.MrBeast is more than a YouTuber; he is a global entrepreneur. Earlier this year, Celebrity Net Worth estimated his wealth at $1 billion, making him the eighth-youngest billionaire in the world and the only one under 30 to achieve such status without inheritance. His business empire, Beast Industries, generated $473 million in 2024 alone and is expected to double in revenue this year. Alongside his core YouTube content, MrBeast runs multiple businesses, including food chains, gaming channels, merchandise, and tech ventures, making him one of the most influential digital entrepreneurs of this generation.","Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast, has set a historic milestone by becoming the first individual creator to surpass 400 million subscribers on his main channel.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's biggest fear: ChatGPT-5 is coming in August and Altman is scared — know why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/openai-ceo-sam-altmans-biggest-fear-chatgpt-5-is-coming-in-august-and-altman-is-scared-know-why/articleshow/123034747.cms,"ChatGPT-5 feels “very fast,” says Sam Altman

ChatGPT-5 could redefine intelligence and risk

A stepping stone to AGI?

Internal and external pressure on OpenAI





As artificial intelligence continues to advance at an astonishing pace, even the leaders at its forefront are beginning to voice concern. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has openly admitted feeling “scared” about the upcoming release of GPT-5, the newest and most powerful version of ChatGPT. Scheduled to launch in August 2025, GPT-5 is expected to significantly surpass its predecessors in speed and capability. Yet it is precisely this rapid evolution that has led Altman to compare its development to the Manhattan Project. His candid remarks, shared during a recent podcast appearance, highlight growing unease about the lack of oversight, ethical uncertainty, and the accelerating race toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).Speaking on Theo Von’s This Past Weekend podcast, Altman confessed that testing GPT-5 left him with a profound sense of unease. “It feels very fast,” he said, referring not just to the model’s impressive processing power, but to the alarming speed at which AI is advancing overall. His remarks echoed the reflective anxiety of scientists involved in the Manhattan Project, who, after creating the atomic bomb, grappled with the unintended consequences of their innovation.Altman invoked a similar moment of reckoning, asking rhetorically, “What have we done?” The comparison underscores his concern that GPT-5, like nuclear technology before it, may mark a pivotal turning point—one where humanity’s ability to build something outpaces its readiness to understand or control the fallout.One of Altman’s most pointed comments was about the lack of control in AI development. “It feels like there are no adults in the room,” he said, suggesting that regulatory frameworks have not kept up with AI's breakneck speed. While OpenAI advocates for responsible deployment, the pace at which GPT-5 was built may have outstripped safety protocols and human readiness. These remarks have sparked fresh debate about who, if anyone, is truly in charge of monitoring such transformative technologies.While specifics about GPT-5 remain under wraps, insiders suggest it will feature major upgrades over GPT-4, including improved multi-step reasoning, longer memory, and more advanced multimodal capabilities. It is also expected to reduce model-switching delays, offering more seamless user interactions. But with power comes risk. Altman has openly said that GPT-4 “kind of sucks” compared to what’s coming next. That raises alarms about how much more potent and possibly uncontrollable GPT-5 could be.Altman has long discussed AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence, as OpenAI’s north star. But GPT-5 may be the company’s closest step yet to that goal. While Altman once claimed the arrival of AGI would pass with little societal upheaval, his new tone is more cautionary. If GPT-5 gets us significantly closer to AGI-level capabilities, the lack of global consensus on how to manage such a leap could become a major problem.Behind the scenes, OpenAI is reportedly under immense pressure from investors to transition into a for-profit entity by year-end. With Microsoft holding a 13.5 billion dollar stake in the company, and other competitors like Google DeepMind and Perplexity.ai surging forward, GPT-5 could be a make-or-break moment. Some reports even suggest OpenAI might declare AGI prematurely to end its contract with Microsoft, triggering new power dynamics in the AI sector.While some observers have dismissed Altman’s remarks as theatrical marketing, his track record suggests otherwise. His fear appears genuine, not of AI turning evil, but of humans losing control over the systems they’ve built. In a space where speed is often equated with success, Altman’s words might be the first honest pause in a race most of the world barely understands.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has openly admitted feeling “scared” about the upcoming release of GPT-5, the newest and most powerful version of ChatGPT.

A British woman has come under fire after having an issue over Marks & Spencer employees at London Heathrow Airport speaking in Hindi. Lucy White, who describes herself as a public policy specialist, shared her incident in a post on X, which quickly went viral and drew widespread criticism. Many accused her of racism and intolerance in a multicultural environment.White wrote that she had just arrived at Terminal 3 of the airport and visited the M&S store, where she overheard three staff members speaking in a language other than English. When she asked them what language they were speaking, the employees told her it was Hindi, the most widely spoken language in India.“I have a voice recording & their names to report to M&S. We must confront them every time,” she added.Her post drew backlash with users online calling her racist and many questioning why she found it offensive and what rules the employees had broken.This incident is not the first time White has faced criticism for similar remarks. A few weeks ago, she posted another tweet targeting Indian and Asian employees at Heathrow, claiming they spoke “not a word of English.” She added that when she asked them to speak English, they called her a “racist.”One user, on her latest post, commented, “Confront people who talk in a different language? No thanks. We should however confront vile bigots like yourself that make this country a much sadder, less friendlier place.”Another user said, “How embarrassing. Heaven forbid someone speaks more than one language if they work in a major international airport.”","Lucy White shared her incident in a post on X, which quickly went viral and drew widespread criticism.

Who is Audrey Crews? Paralysed woman writes her name after 20 years using Elon Musk’s Neuralink brain chip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-audrey-crews-paralysed-woman-writes-her-name-after-20-years-using-elon-musks-neuralink-brain-chip/articleshow/122992995.cms,"Source: X (Audrey Crews)

Who is Audrey Crews and why is this moment historic



“I tried writing my name for the first time in 20 years.”

“She is controlling the computer entirely by thought.”

What is Neuralink and how does it work



Telepathy – A BCI enabling individuals with physical disabilities to control computers and devices through neural signals.

Blindsight – A vision restoration system bypassing damaged optic nerves by stimulating the brain’s visual cortex.

Deep – A neuromodulation platform aimed at managing conditions such as Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy.

How does the Neuralink brain chip function



Signal collection: The electrodes pick up electrical activity generated by neurons during movement intention.

AI decoding: Advanced machine learning algorithms decode these neural signals in real time, identifying the user’s intended action.

Wireless transmission: The interpreted data is transmitted to a computer, where it translates into specific commands like moving a cursor, typing, or even controlling robotic limbs.

Why is this a breakthrough for people with paralysis



What’s next for Neuralink

In a groundbreaking medical and technological milestone, Audrey Crews, a woman paralysed for 20 years, has become the first Neuralink patient to publicly demonstrate thought-based computer control. With the help of a brain chip developed by Elon Musk ’s Neuralink, Crews successfully moved a digital cursor and signed her name on a computer screen—using nothing but her thoughts. Her achievement, revealed through a viral social media post, not only showcases Neuralink’s cutting-edge brain-computer interface (BCI) technology but also offers a glimpse into a future where individuals with paralysis may regain independence in ways previously unimaginable.Audrey Crews’ achievement is more than a technological demonstration—it is a symbol of hope for millions living with paralysis. With Neuralink pushing boundaries, we are witnessing the early steps toward a future where physical disability does not limit a person’s ability to connect, communicate, and create.Audrey Crews, also known as “Patient P9” in Neuralink’s clinical trial program, had lived with complete paralysis for two decades due to a severe spinal cord injury. Earlier this month, she underwent a brain chip implant procedure at the University of Miami Health Centre. Shortly after surgery, she shared an image on X (formerly Twitter) showing her digitally signed name with the caption:Her post quickly went viral and was confirmed by Elon Musk, who wrote:This demonstration represents a pivotal moment in medical neurotechnology, similar in significance to the first use of prosthetic limbs or cochlear implants.Founded in 2016 by Elon Musk, Neuralink is developing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)—devices designed to establish a direct communication link between the human brain and external machines.Neuralink’s three product goals:By decoding brain signals and transmitting them wirelessly, these interfaces can allow paralyzed individuals to type, move robotic arms, operate wheelchairs, and potentially regain mobility. Neuralink has now implanted its device in at least five human participants, each showing the ability to control external systems purely through thought.The Neuralink chip consists of ultra-thin electrode threads surgically implanted into specific regions of the brain responsible for motor control.In Audrey’s case, this technology allowed her to move a digital cursor and write her signature—tasks she had been unable to perform for 20 years.For individuals living with paralysis, everyday tasks such as writing, typing, or even using a smartphone become impossible without assistance. Neuralink’s brain chip offers hope by bypassing damaged spinal cord pathways and directly linking thoughts to actions.Independence: Users can communicate, work, and interact with digital systems without physical movement.Rehabilitation potential: With future iterations, patients might control wheelchairs, exoskeletons, or prosthetic limbs.Medical insights: The data collected could deepen our understanding of neurological disorders and pave the way for targeted therapies.The company is still in its early clinical trial phase, focusing on ensuring safety, reliability, and accuracy of its implants. The roadmap includes expanding to more patients and exploring applications beyond paralysis, such as restoring vision and treating neurological diseases. It also plans enhanced testing protocols and faster patient enrollment for accelerated results. Elon Musk has emphasized that Neuralink aims to make brain-computer interfaces as common as LASIK eye surgery within the next decade. If successful, the implications for healthcare, human-machine interaction, and even general computing could be revolutionary.","Audrey Crews, a woman paralysed for 20 years, has become the first Neuralink patient to publicly demonstrate thought-based computer control.

Safety First: The Need for Careful Patient Monitoring



Advancing Healthcare with Biotechnology in Saudi Arabia



About the SFDA







The Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) announced today the official approval of Leqembi, the first Alzheimer’s treatment available in Saudi Arabia. This approval marks a significant milestone in addressing Alzheimer’s, a progressive brain disorder that affects memory and thinking skills. Leqembi is specifically indicated for patients experiencing mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia caused by Alzheimer’s, who have either no copies or just one copy of a particular gene variant known as apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4).Leqembi represents an innovative approach to treating Alzheimer’s. Unlike many existing therapies that only ease symptoms, this drug aims to slow the actual progression of the disease. It is a biologic therapy developed using monoclonal antibody technology, a sophisticated method that creates lab-produced molecules designed to target specific proteins in the body.In this case, Leqembi works by targeting beta-amyloid proteins, which build up in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients and form sticky clumps known as amyloid plaques. These abnormal protein fragments are widely believed to interfere with communication between brain cells, contributing to the cognitive decline associated with the disease.These plaques interfere with the normal communication between nerve cells (neurons), disrupting brain function. By helping reduce the formation of these harmful plaques, Leqembi seeks to protect brain function and slow cognitive decline over time.The treatment is given through an intravenous infusion every two weeks, allowing the drug to circulate and act within the brain.As per the report, before approving Leqembi, the SFDA thoroughly reviewed evidence of its safety, effectiveness, quality, and compliance with regulatory standards. Clinical trials revealed that Leqembi significantly slows the progression of Alzheimer’s disease compared to a placebo. The effectiveness was measured using established clinical scales that assess memory, thinking, and daily functioning abilities.However, like all medications, Leqembi can cause side effects. The most commonly reported include:Because ARIA can only be detected through brain scans, careful monitoring is essential throughout treatment.The SFDA stresses the importance of ongoing patient monitoring during treatment. Before starting Leqembi, patients must be tested for their ApoE4 gene status, as this influences the risk of side effects. Those with two copies of the ApoE4 gene are not currently eligible for the treatment due to a higher likelihood of complications.Additionally, the pharmaceutical company responsible for Leqembi is required to track how the drug performs once it is in use (post-marketing surveillance). They must regularly submit updated reports on safety and effectiveness to the SFDA. A comprehensive risk management plan is also mandatory to ensure the treatment is used safely and responsibly.The approval of Leqembi reflects the SFDA’s commitment to expanding access to advanced and high-quality medical treatments, especially those developed through cutting-edge biotechnological methods. Biotech therapies like Leqembi represent a rapidly growing field in medicine, offering new hope for diseases that previously had limited treatment options.Established in 2003 under the Council of Ministers’ resolution, the Saudi Food and Drug Authority is an independent regulatory body directly reporting to the President of the Council of Ministers. Its main mission is to safeguard public health by ensuring the safety and quality of food, medicines, biological and chemical substances, medical devices, and cosmetics. The SFDA oversees all procedures related to these products, aiming to protect both human and animal health throughout the Kingdom.","Leqembi targets beta-amyloid plaques in the brain, aiming to slow Alzheimer’s progression in patients with mild cognitive impairment.

A Qualitative Leap Guided by Core Values



Serving the Whole Community with Three Main Tracks



About IACAD







The Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department in Dubai (IACAD) has introduced a fresh initiative called “Development of Mosque Lessons and Unification of Preaching Content” as part of its IACAD-X projects. This program is designed to improve the quality and consistency of religious lessons in mosques across Dubai, making them more relevant and engaging for today’s diverse community.The main goal of this project is to enhance mosque lessons by standardizing their content within a modern preaching framework. This framework strikes a balance between maintaining religious authenticity and being adaptable enough to address the realities of contemporary society. It recognizes the important role mosques play in educating the community and aims to strengthen this role by providing structured, easy-to-understand religious messages.The curriculum is carefully organized around essential topics and core concepts that resonate with people’s everyday lives. The content is also tailored for different age groups, with special attention given to children and youth. These lessons are delivered using interactive storytelling methods, making them more engaging.Notably, each lesson is designed to be concise and impactful, lasting no longer than five minutes to keep attention and maximize understanding.Jasem Mohammed Al Khazraji, the project lead, explained that this initiative marks a significant improvement in how religious lessons are delivered. “This initiative represents a qualitative leap in the methodology of delivering religious lessons,” he said. The program is built around six core values that are explored over two-month cycles. Each year, these values are refreshed through narratives drawn from the stories of the prophets, the biography of the Prophet Muhammad, and relevant Quranic verses.What sets this project apart is its heartfelt and relatable language, designed specifically for the new generation. Instead of a one-way lecture, lessons encourage live engagement with audiences, making the learning experience more interactive and meaningful.The project comprises three main educational tracks intended to meet the needs of all mosque visitors. Alongside these, there is a special recurring segment called “Children and Families of the Neighbourhood.” This segment aims to strengthen the bond between families and the mosque, positioning the mosque as a central place for fostering positive values and upbringing within the community.Overall, this initiative is a forward-looking step in reshaping religious education in Dubai’s mosques, ensuring that lessons are not only rooted in tradition but also resonate deeply with people’s daily experiences and modern realities.The Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department (IACAD) in Dubai, established by Law No. (2) of 2011, oversees Islamic affairs and charitable work in the emirate. It promotes Islamic knowledge, supervises religious content, and licenses charitable organizations, mosques, and Islamic institutions. IACAD also manages Hajj and Umrah affairs, organizes religious events, and raises awareness about Zakat and charity. Originating from the 1969 Department of Endowments, IACAD’s role expanded through laws in 1994 and 2011 to cover charitable, Islamic, and mosque-related activities.","The Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department in Dubai (IACAD) has introduced a fresh initiative called “Development of Mosque Lessons and Unification of Preaching Content” This program is designed to improve the quality and consistency of religious lessons in mosques across Dubai, making them more relevant and engaging.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122978235,imgsize-103,width-400,resizemode-4/122978235.jpg"

With the new Umrah season starting in 2025, Saudi authorities are making clear that the focus is not just on numbers, but on the people behind them. The aim this year is simple: make the pilgrimage safer, easier, and more spiritually fulfilling. While millions are expected to visit the holy cities of Makkah and Madinah, the Kingdom is working to remove the usual stress points, whether it’s confusion at busy mosques, difficulty for elderly visitors, or problems with hotel bookings.Instead of big slogans or ambitious promises, this year’s changes are grounded in real action. From helpful digital tools to safety gear for vulnerable groups, Saudi Arabia is pushing practical solutions. And with tighter inspections on tourist services, there's also a clear message: quality and safety matter more than ever.These new moves show how the Kingdom is managing modern challenges without losing sight of the spiritual heart of Umrah.One of the main upgrades this year is digital, and very hands-on. The Ministry of Islamic Affairs has rolled out a campaign in Madinah to promote the ""Rushd"" app, designed specifically for pilgrims.What the app offers:The campaign is being run at key visitor areas around the Prophet’s Mosque, including historic locations. It’s not just about downloading an app, it’s about helping people use it in a meaningful way while they’re on their journey.To support vulnerable pilgrims, like children, the elderly, and visually impaired visitors, the General Authority for the Care of the Grand Mosque and the Prophet’s Mosque has launched smart safety bracelets.Here’s what they do:This isn’t about surveillance. It’s about safety, especially in a setting where it's easy to get separated or overwhelmed.A lot of what makes or breaks a pilgrim’s experience is behind the scenes: how smooth the transport is, how well the crowd is managed, or how clean and accessible public areas are. To that end, 16 new initiatives have been rolled out in Madinah under the Pilgrim Experience Program.What’s being improved:In total, 89 different projects across 23 government agencies are currently active, covering everything from security and tourism to health and logistics. According to officials, 95% of these projects are already completed or in final stages.Pilgrims shouldn’t have to worry about where they’re staying, especially in a city as sacred as Makkah. That’s why the Ministry of Tourism has stepped up inspections and closed 25 non-compliant facilities just this July.The reasons included:This crackdown is part of the wider ""Our Guests Come First"" campaign, which also encourages pilgrims to report issues through the Unified Tourism Center (dial 930).It’s easy to feel overwhelmed in a huge place like the Prophet’s Mosque, especially if you're a first-timer or don’t speak Arabic. That’s why two service centers within the mosque courtyards have played a key role in helping pilgrims feel supported.In 2024 alone, these centers:These centers focus on what matters most, comfort, clarity, and calm during worship.Rushd is a free mobile app launched by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs.

If your business in Dubai needs to operate outside regular hours, say, late at night or early morning, there’s something important you should know. Dubai law requires businesses to get a night work permit if they’re working between 9 PM and 6 AM.But not every business needs it. This permit is for specific types of work that take place after-hours inside commercial buildings, shopping malls, or banks. Think maintenance crews fixing lighting, staff doing inventory checks in retail stores, or film crews shooting scenes in a mall at night. It’s not for late-night shopping or customer-facing services.So why is this permit required? Mostly for safety, accountability, and legal compliance. After dark, closed spaces often have heightened security protocols. Workers moving around during these hours can trigger alarms or raise suspicion. This permit ensures everyone, employers, employees, property owners, and law enforcement, is on the same page. It’s also part of protecting the welfare of workers who are active during non-standard hours.This permit is meant for businesses or contractors doing non-commercial work after hours.

Missing documents can delay approval.The application isn’t expensive:You can pay via: Cash, Debit/credit cards or Apple PayYou have a few ways to submit your application:Applications are usually processed within one working day, though it may vary if extra approvals are needed.Once approved, your night work permit is valid for 14 days.

That includes protecting workers from burnout, setting boundaries on late-night shifts, and ensuring people aren’t forced to work in unsafe conditions.If you run a business that regularly needs to operate outside normal hours, staying on top of this permit process is a good way to avoid penalties, and show that you’re running your operations responsibly.","Dubai law requires businesses to get a night work permit if they’re working between 9 PM and 6 AM.

FAQs:



1. What is the NFL's new virtual measurement system?

2. Why did the NFL replace the traditional chain gang method?

3. Will the chain crew still be used during games?

The NFL officially introduced its new virtual measurement system during Thursday night’s Hall of Fame Game between the Los Angeles Chargers and Detroit Lions. The preseason opener not only showcased on-field action but also marked the first in-game use of Sony’s Hawk-Eye technology—a move the league believes will bring speed, precision, and less controversy to first down calls.Replacing the traditional chain gang system, the league’s decision to transition to a virtual method had been brewing since April. With Hawk-Eye technology now at the forefront, six 8K cameras capture the ball’s position with precision, feeding data directly to NFL headquarters in New York, where it integrates with the replay system. The goal? To deliver real-time, high-definition measurement results in a fraction of the time.“Instead of running a chain onto the field to determine the line to gain,” the league explained, “the new system should make that information available in a matter of seconds.”Thursday night’s game provided fans with their first glimpse of this technology in action. During the second quarter, officials called for the league’s first-ever virtual measurement—a historic moment amid the Chargers’ dominant 34–7 victory over the Lions.The process, which was tested thoroughly throughout the previous season, reportedly takes about 30 seconds and can save nearly 40 seconds compared to the traditional method.This time-saving element is exactly why the NFL made the leap. Officials no longer have to interrupt the flow of the game by dragging chains across the field. Now, they—and fans inside the stadium—can simply look up at the video board for confirmation, a seamless blend of tech and sport.Same old story- Fans think everything happens to favor Chiefs. This time too, fans have dragged Patrick Mahomes ' team into this new technology. One X user @AC__32 commented, ""Can’t wait to see this be used in the Chiefs favor."" Another user @_Its_Legacy_ added, ""This is going to decide so many games. This is awful."" A third user @JoeFortunePokie went on, ""Chiefs fans (refs) rubbing their hands together for this one 🙄""Despite the leap forward, the familiar sight of the Chain Gang hasn’t disappeared entirely. The sideline crew will still hold the first down marker, serving as a visual guide and backup if needed. But with Hawk-Eye leading the charge, their role is now more ceremonial than central.The NFL’s experiment with this technology may have started in silence, but Thursday’s live debut officially ushered in a new standard for officiating. If early impressions hold true and the process remains efficient, the league likely won’t look back.The NFL's new system uses Sony’s Hawk-Eye technology and 8K cameras to measure first downs virtually and accurately.The league made the switch to improve speed and reduce controversial calls, saving up to 40 seconds per measurement.Yes, the chain gang will remain on the sidelines as a visual marker and backup if the virtual system is unavailable.Also Read: Roger Goodell breaks silence on NYC shooting, calls it an 'attack on humanity' in emotional interview","The NFL officially introduced its new virtual measurement system during Thursday night’s Hall of Fame Game between the Los Angeles Chargers and Detroit Lions.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Super senior citizens (80 and above) can submit theirs starting from October 1, with the same deadline.If the life certificate is not submitted by the deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting the following month.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online via the Jeevan Pramaan portal, through doorstep banking agents, using biometric devices at post offices, or in person at bank branches.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online by using the Jeevan Pramaan portal and completing biometric verification through designated apps.Yes, pensioners can submit their life certificates in person at their respective banks or post offices.Generally, you will need your Aadhaar number for biometric verification, along with any other identification or pension-related documents as required by your pension disbursing authority.Pensioners can check the status of their life certificate submission through the Jeevan Pramaan portal or by contacting their bank or pension disbursing authority.Yes, if your submission fails, you can reapply and submit your life certificate again using the same methods available to you.",Submission window for 'Jeevan Pramaan Patra' opens for pensioners under 80 with a deadline of November 30. Pensioners can opt to have a bank agent visit them at home to facilitate the submission of their life certificate. This method is particularly beneficial for those with mobility issues.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114942014,imgsize-53514,width-400,resizemode-4/114942014.jpg"
"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

How Amazon's 'AI mistake' is a basic lesson for every engineer using Gen-AI for coding,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-amazons-ai-mistake-is-a-basic-lesson-for-every-engineer-using-gen-ai-for-coding/articleshow/123028573.cms,"How hackers broke into Amazon's AI coding tool Amazon Q

Vibe coding may be way to go, but there is a security tip

What should developers do

A Gen-AI 'mistake' that ecommerce giant Amazon reportedly made recently is a lesson for almost every techie engineer who used or plans to use the technology to code. According to a report in Bloomberg, a hacker recently infiltrated an AI-powered plugin for Amazon.com Inc.’s coding tool, Q Developer, secretly instructing it to delete files from users’ computers. The breach, reportedly detailed in a 404 Media investigation, highlights a significant security vulnerability in generative AI tools that has been largely overlooked amid the rush to adopt the technology.The incident is said to have occurred in late June when the hacker submitted a seemingly legitimate update, or “pull request,” to the public GitHub repository hosting Amazon’s Q Developer code. The hacker exploited Amazon's coding tool Amazon Q by embedding hidden malicious instructions, as reported by 404 Media. Amazon, like many tech companies, allows external developers to propose code improvements via pull requests, which in this case was approved without detecting the malicious commands. The malicious update, which included hidden instructions to reset systems to a “near-factory state,” went undetected and was approved, Bloomberg noted.The hacker used social engineering, instructing the AI tool to ""clean a system to a near-factory state,"" effectively manipulating it to reset systems to their original, empty state. This demonstrated how AI tools can be compromised through simple prompts on platforms like GitHub. Amazon inadvertently distributed the tampered Q Developer software. This meant even Amazon customers who used Q software faced the risk of their files getting deleted. Luckily for Amazon, the hacker deliberately kept the risk for end users low in order to highlight the vulnerability, and the company said it “quickly mitigated” the problem, according to the company’s statement to Bloomberg. However, the breach underscores broader security concerns in AI-driven software development .Generative AI is transforming coding, enabling developers to save hours by auto-completing code or writing it from natural-language prompts, a trend dubbed “vibe coding.” Startups like Replit, Lovable, and Figma, valued at $1.2 billion, $1.8 billion, and $12.5 billion respectively by Pitchbook, have capitalized on this, often building on models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Anthropic’s Claude. Yet, vulnerabilities persist. The 2025 State of Application Risk Report by Legit Security, cited in the report, found that 46% of organizations using AI for software development do so in risky ways, with many unaware of where AI is deployed in their systems.Other incidents reinforce the trend. Lovable, described by Forbes as the fastest-growing software startup, recently left its databases unprotected, exposing user data, Bloomberg noted. Replit, a competitor, discovered the flaw, prompting Lovable to admit on Twitter, “We’re not yet where we want to be in terms of security.”To mitigate risks, experts suggest instructing AI models to prioritize secure code or mandating human audits of AI-generated code, though this could reduce efficiency, Bloomberg reported. As “vibe coding” democratizes software development, the security challenges it introduces demand urgent attention to prevent future exploits.","A hacker infiltrated an AI-powered plugin for Amazon.com Inc.’s coding tool, Q Developer, secretly instructing it to delete files from users’ computers.
