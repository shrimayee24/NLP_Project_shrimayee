Is Roblox really shutting down after backlash and ongoing scrutiny?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/news/is-roblox-really-shutting-down-after-backlash-and-ongoing-scrutiny/articleshow/123382058.cms,"(Image via Getty Images)

Is Roblox shutting down?



""While this was not an easy choice, we believe it is in the best interest of our community. We want to thank everyone who has been part of this journey. Your voices have been heard, and your well-being remains our top priority.""

""Effective September Ist, the platform will no longer be available,""

What can lead to Roblox finally being shut down in 2025?



A viral notice that claims Roblox will shut down on September 1, 2025, permanently has ignited a panic among its players. The message in the notice cited Roblox safety concerns and the popular demand for the platform to shut down, as the reasons behind their step. This notice that now seems to be all over X, is coming at a time when Roblox is facing legal scrutiny and international bans. So, is this the end of the popular gaming platform, or is it just a part of the recurring hoax?Here is all we know about the circulating news and whether or not it is officially true.An official-looking announcement, stating Roblox is shutting down, has spread rapidly on X. It states that Roblox made a decision to shut down permanently from September 1, 2025, due to user demand and security concerns. The official announcement further stated,While the announcement that seemed to be official, stated,there is still no news of whether or not it is true. Quite crucially, no official confirmation has been received about this from Roblox.This is not the first time that rumors of Roblox shutting down have surfaced all over social media. In the past, Roblox repeatedly denied the claims of Roblox shutdown rumors, calling it a hoax and giving reassurances to the players that the game “isn’t going anywhere.”What’s interesting about the current circulating claims is that Roblox has been under a lot of pressure. From demands for the Roblox CEO resignation to changes in their policies and even the drop in the share price of Roblox, fans speculate that this time, the news can be true.Even the lack of denial or immediate confirmation from the end of Roblox is quite unusual. It has left this situation ambiguous, with players awaiting an official statement soon.While Roblox isn’t any stranger to controversies, the recent lawsuits against the platform by the state of Louisiana, accusing it of failing to protect the young crowd from inappropriate content and predators, have taken a major toll. Games like Escape to Epstein Island and Diddy Party have also been cited as examples of Roblox explicit content that have been accessible to minors.The lawsuit was not an isolated incident. Many countries, including Turkey, China, and Oman, have banned the platform. Now with Qatar's recent Roblox ban, after social media pushing to take action, over the platform's rising child safety concerns, have brought a lot of Roblox legal troubles. Critics argue that the rapid growth of Roblox has outpaced the platform’s ability to enforce needed moderation. While Roblox did bring in safety measures, including Roblox AI monitoring, there are many who believe all these measures are just reactive and not preventative.In short, with the Roblox international bans, lawsuits, and the play-led boycotts, like #BoycottTheHatch,” Roblox has been facing mounting pressure. The recent viral notice circulating about Roblox shutting down—whether fake or real—shows increased frustration amongst the users, critics and concerned citizens.As of now, the gaming platform remains operational, with millions of gamers aiming for it to be the same. However, the company being silent on the latest rumors is quite concerning. In case the legal actions do succeed, some stricter regulations can force major changes or, worse, can make the platform back off by finally shutting it down.","A viral notice that claims Roblox will shut down on September 1, 2025, permanently has ignited a panic among its players.

Google unveils ‘Gemini for Home’ AI assistant and teases new smart speaker,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-unveils-gemini-for-home-ai-assistant-and-teases-new-smart-speaker/articleshow/123423066.cms,"Gemini replaces Google Assistant



A glimpse at the mew smart speaker



At its annual Made by Google 2025 hardware event, the tech giant introduced Gemini for Home, a next-generation AI assistant created to transform how users interact with their smart homes. Built on Google’s most advanced Gemini models, the assistant promises more natural, intelligent, and personalized help across everyday tasks—from media playback and smart device control to cooking and troubleshooting. “Now, we’re introducing an all-new voice assistant for the next generation of help at home: Gemini for Home. Gemini for Home is built on the same powerful AI models, with unique capabilities designed for the home. It offers reliable, hands-free help and can manage complex tasks across all of your home devices, assisting every member of your household, as well as visitors and guests,” said the company.The company has announced that Gemini for Home is all set to replace Google Assistant on Nest speakers and displays over time. Gemini for Home will offer deeper reasoning, advanced search capabilities and more fluid conversations. However, users can still say ‘Hey Google’ to activate it but the interactions will feel more intuitive.Along with this, the assistant also introduces Gemini Live which is a conversation model that allows back-and-forth dialogue without repeating the wake word. “Kick off a Gemini Live conversation with “Hey Google, let’s chat” and from that point on, have a natural back-and-forth discussion (no more “Hey Google” required). Explore new concepts, learn a skill, brainstorm ideas or get personalized advice. You can also interrupt responses to refine or redirect the discussion, so you get the specific information you’re looking for quickly,” said the company.Alongside the Gemini announcement, Google also showcased its new smart speaker briefly. The device appears to be a squished-down spherical design, reminiscent of the Nest Wifi, with a glowing blue-purple-white ring at its base—likely signaling Gemini’s presence. While details on the speaker’s specs and release date remain under wraps, its appearance suggests a fresh hardware direction to complement Gemini’s upgraded capabilities.Google confirmed that early access to Gemini for Home will begin in October, with both free and paid versions planned for rollout.","Gemini for Home is a next-generation AI assistant created to transform how users interact with their smart homes.

Transparency with C2PA content credentials



Google recently unveiled its latest Pixel 10 smartphones series at its annual hardware event. Apart from launching the new phones, the company also announced a major update for Google Photos. The tech giant has revealed that the Google Photos will soon get conversation editing feature which will enable users to improve their images by simply describing the changes they want. “We’re making it unbelievably easy to quickly edit your images in Google Photos ― just ask Photos to edit your pictures for you. Coming first to Pixel 10 in the U.S., you can simply describe the edits you want to make by text or voice in Photos’ editor, and watch the changes appear,” said Google.Powered by advanced Gemini AI models users can now simply type or speak prompts like “remove the cars in the background” or “restore this old photo,” and Google Photos will automatically apply the requested changes. The company claims that AI can understand bth specific and general instructions. The feature also allow users to do multiple edits with a single prompt such as “remove reflections and fix the washed-out colours.” For those unsure where to start, a simple “make it better” will trigger intelligent enhancements.Beyond corrective edits like lighting and removing distractions, you can ask for more creative help. For example, you could change the background of your image, add fun items like a party hat or sunglasses to the main subject and so much more.To promote transparency around AI-edited images, Google Photos is also rolling out support for C2PA Content Credentials. These indicators will show how an image was captured or modified, helping users understand the origin and authenticity of their photos. Pixel 10 devices will be the first to implement industry-standard C2PA Content Credentials within the native camera app, across photos created by Pixel Camera, with and without AI.","Google Photos will soon get conversation editing feature which will enable users to improve their images by simply describing the changes they want.

Scammer unmasked in UP: Tech vigilante hacks webcam; traces 'Microsoft' impersonator to Raebareli,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/scammer-unmasked-in-up-tech-vigilante-hacks-webcam-traces-microsoft-impersonator-to-raebareli/articleshow/123421640.cms,"X thread

LUCKNOW: A man from Raebareli district of Uttar Pradesh, Gaurav Trivedi, allegedly ran a deceptive scheme from his residence. His method was to spread fear, targeting vulnerable people by tricking them into believing their computers were under attack. He also operated a classic Microsoft tech support scam—beginning with a fake popup, a loud alarm, and a message urging users to call “Microsoft” immediately or risk losing their data.However, his scheme faltered when he targeted the wrong person.Enter NanoBaiter, a digital vigilante known for exposing scammers online. When Gaurav attempted to scam him, NanoBaiter did not panic. Instead, he played along, granting access to a virtual machine. What Gaurav did not know was that NanoBaiter was quietly reversing the connection, hacking into the scammer’s system.What followed was a masterclass in digital sleuthing. NanoBaiter accessed Gaurav’s webcam, capturing a clear image of his face. He watched as Gaurav navigated his softphone dialler, revealing his real name. Then, using the active Wi-Fi card on Gaurav’s laptop, NanoBaiter traced his exact location—coordinates pointing directly to Raebareli.For days, NanoBaiter had a front-row seat to Gaurav’s life. He watched him eat, sleep, and scam innocent people—all through the webcam. Then came the confrontation. NanoBaiter spoke directly to Gaurav through the very webcam he had hijacked. The scammer’s stunned reaction was captured live, a moment of reckoning for someone who had preyed on others without remorse.NanoBaiter did not stop there. He tagged Raebareli Police on social media, urging them to take action against Gaurav and others like him.It was not immediately clear if the local police had taken cognisance of the alleged scammer.""In a world where cybercrime often goes unchecked, NanoBaiter’s actions remind us that sometimes, the best way to fight back is to turn the tools of deception against the deceivers,"" wrote a social media user.Another user wrote, ""There's an entire YouTube genre of white-hat hackers identifying online scammers right down to the buildings they operate out of. Over 90% originate in India.""","A man from Raebareli district of Uttar Pradesh, Gaurav Trivedi, allegedly ran a deceptive scheme from his residence.

Britain agrees to drop mandate for Apple to provide 'back door',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-agrees-to-drop-mandate-for-apple-to-provide-back-door/articleshow/123395824.cms,"Representative Image





SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain dropped a request for Apple to create a tool to give law enforcement access to customers' cloud data.

Four men in Northampton, England, raced away from an Indian restaurant without paying their 200-pound (about Rs 21,000) bill, which led to a spectacular chase by the staff. According to a Daily Mail article, the event took place in the Saffron restaurant at around 10.11 pm on August 4.Men can be seen entering the restaurant in the widely circulated CCTV footage posted on Instagram. Later in the video, they can be seen rushing out of the restaurant's door after leaving their table. When they reveal their intent, a staff member may be seen pursuing them. According to the complaint by the eatery, those men ordered and consumed 197.30 pounds of food, which included lamb chops, several curries, and other dishes.The company later posted the bill on Facebook. The bill breakdown included four plain poppadoms for £5.60, one chutney tray for £2.20, two chargrilled lamb chops for £24.00, three chicken chat dishes for £30.00, two chicken tikka mains for £28.00, two chicken tikka masalas for £32.00, two boiled rice portions for £11.00, two garlic naans for £12.00, three chapatis for £12.00, one serving of chips for £4.50, and nine 330 ml glass bottles of Coke for £36.00.Police in Northamptonshire acknowledged that they are looking into the event as a possible theft.""This kind of behavior isn't just theft; it affects hardworking small businesses and our local community,"" they wrote in a Facebook post.Online, the post generated a range of responses.

‘Racist’: Swatch ad outrages China; watchmaker apologises over ‘slant-eye’ gesture,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/racist-swatch-ad-outrages-china-watchmaker-apologises-over-slant-eye-gesture/articleshow/123360241.cms,"Picture source: X





Swiss watchmaker Swatch has apologised and withdrawn an advertisement after it sparked anger in China for being racist.The ad showed an Asian male model pulling the corners of his eyes, a gesture widely criticised online as offensive. Chinese social media users accused the company of racism and called for a boycott of its products.On Saturday, Swatch said in posts on Instagram and Weibo that it had removed the campaign worldwide. “We sincerely apologise for any distress or misunderstanding this may have caused,” the company wrote.But many online said the apology was not enough. A popular Weibo user with more than one million followers accused Swatch of “racism against Chinese” and urged regulators to take action.Others claimed the ""slant-eye"" gesture"" was deliberate discrimination and demanded a boycott. ""The brand's image has collapsed. (Swatch) thinks they can just apologise and salvage everything? It's not that simple,"" one user wrote.China is among Swatch Group’s biggest markets, but like other Western luxury brands, the company has struggled with falling sales as the economy slows and buyers shift to cheaper options. In July, the group reported an 11.2 percent fall in net sales in the first half of the year, blaming weak demand in China.Swatch is not the first brand to face such criticism. Dolce & Gabbana faced backlash in 2018 for ads showing a Chinese model awkwardly using chopsticks, and Dior was accused of racism in 2023 over a photo of a model pulling her eye corner.","Chinese social media users accused the company of racism.

Dubai International Airport has launched a cutting-edge, AI-powered corridor that allows travellers to bypass traditional passport control in seconds. Unveiled by the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA), the new system can process multiple passengers simultaneously—marking a global first in airport immigration technology and advancing Dubai’s vision for seamless, document-free travel.Dubai has introduced the world’s first artificial intelligence-powered immigration corridor at Dubai International Airport (DXB), which has retained its title as the busiest international airport for the 11th consecutive year. The initiative was officially announced by Lieutenant General Mohammed Ahmed Al Marri, Director General of the GDRFA.This innovation enables passengers to walk across a special passage—referred to internally as the “red carpet”—to complete immigration formalities without stopping or presenting travel documents. Up to ten passengers can pass through at the same time, a significant improvement over the traditional one-passenger-at-a-time model.The AI corridor is a major step within Dubai’s broader “travel without borders” strategy. It is designed as part of a larger integrated system aimed at providing faster, smoother, and more secure transit for travellers.The AI corridor processes passenger information automatically and in real time.Using advanced artificial intelligence, the system identifies and verifies travellers before they reach the immigration checkpoint, allowing them to walk through without presenting ID or stopping for inspection.Despite the speed and simplicity, security is not compromised. The system includes built-in mechanisms that flag any suspicious passports and immediately route them to forgery experts for review. This ensures robust screening while reducing manual workload and queue times.As a result, overall processing capacity has doubled, helping reduce congestion and improving efficiency during high-traffic periods.Lieutenant General Al Marri highlighted that DXB is not merely a transit point but a prominent international gateway that reflects the UAE’s progressive identity and hospitality. The launch of the AI-powered corridor reinforces Dubai’s standing as a hub of technological innovation and operational excellence.He further stated that the GDRFA’s work aligns with a long-term innovation roadmap that focuses on leveraging technology to modernise and streamline border control procedures. The shift toward automated, document-free travel is expected to become a defining feature of global air travel, with Dubai leading that transformation.","Dubai's AI-powered immigration corridor at DXB processes ten passengers at once, enabling seamless, document-free entry using biometric verification.

A chatty parrot with a knack for drug slang has helped British police crack down on a prison drug ring, squawking its way into an unlikely role in a major narcotics bust, authorities revealed this week.The Lancashire Constabulary filed charges against 15 individuals connected to the gang, which purportedly distributed drugs across Blackpool, England, from February 2023 to July 2024. The operation was orchestrated by 35-year-old Adam Garnett whilst serving a prison sentence, Fox News reported.The case unfolded after prison staff discovered multiple mobile phones and Wi-Fi routers during a search of Garnett's cell. This finding led investigators to his alleged associates, including Dalbir Sandhu, Shannon Hilton and Jason Gerrand.Subsequent home searches revealed heroin, crack cocaine, ketamine, cannabis, substantial cash amounts and mobile phones connected to drug trafficking A notable discovery came from Hilton's phone, containing recordings of her parrot ""Mango"" repeating ""two for 25,"" believed to be drug transaction terminology.Additional footage showed the bird interacting with money allegedly obtained through illegal activities.Video:""What's the most talented thing your pet can do? Sit? Give paw? How about speak?"" Lancashire Police wrote in a post on the department's Facebook page.""One drug dealer's parrot learned to say 'two for 25' - a phrase picked up as part of common language used by the organised crime gang run by her boyfriend. Not a phrase you want your parrot squawking when the police come knocking!""Investigators uncovered video communications between Hilton and Garnett, including footage displaying kilogram-sized cocaine packages, occasionally accompanied by drug-referencing song lyrics.Despite his imprisonment, Garnett reportedly maintained central control, directing evidence concealment efforts and maintaining communication with virtually all network members.Det. Sgt. Anthony Alves of Lancashire Police's West Targeted Crime Team commended the results, describing it as a ""coordinated and complex drug operation that extended far beyond prison walls.""""Garnett continued to run his enterprise while incarcerated, using illegal devices to maintain control.

Pamela Anderson says there is no feud with Meghan Markle over cooking shows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/pamela-anderson-says-there-is-no-feud-with-meghan-markle-over-cooking-shows/articleshow/123119046.cms,"How the rumour started

Walls Closing In? Meghan Markle Faces Royal Cold Shoulder Amid New Fears: Reports

Different networks, same idea

Anderson’s calm response

What critics say about Markle’s show

Positive buzz for Anderson

No reaction from Meghan





Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series. The former Baywatch star spoke about the issue on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. When Cohen asked her to rate, on a scale of one to ten, how much Markle’s With Love, Meghan looked like her own Pamela’s Cooking With Love, Anderson answered “One.” She added, “I didn’t invent cooking shows. She’s just doing her thing.”Fans noticed that both shows feature garden scenes, casual kitchen chats, and celebrity guests. Anderson’s trailer came out in October 2024. Markle’s teaser followed three months later. Online threads pointed to similar camera angles and even matching font styles in the titles. Some viewers accused the Duchess of releasing a “frame-for-frame” copy.Pamela’s Cooking With Love is streamed on Amazon Prime. Episodes show Anderson and a guest chef picking vegetables in her Vancouver garden before cooking a meal outdoors. Markle’s eight-part Netflix show centres on simple dishes and home-grown produce in Montecito.Both series mix recipes with lifestyle tips, but Anderson stressed that overlap is normal in food television.Anderson told Cohen she had only seen quick clips of Markle’s programme and did not spend time looking for likenesses. She joked that there is room for anyone who wants to share food and stories on screen. Her relaxed tone cooled much of the online debate.With Love, Meghan drew mixed-to-negative reviews (≈38% on Rotten Tomatoes; 37 on Metacritic). It briefly entered Netflix’s Top 10 in its first week, and mid-year engagement tallies cited by several outlets place it outside Netflix’s Top 300. Even so, Netflix has ordered Season 2.Anderson’s series has earned strong notices and a high user score on IMDb. Executive producer Jesse Fawcett said any comparison is a compliment because it proves their team set a trend others want to follow. Anderson plans to film a second garden season next spring.Markle has not commented on Anderson’s remarks. Sources close to her say she is focused on shooting new episodes and expanding her As Ever lifestyle brand. Observers doubt she will address copy-cat talk directly. They note she has stayed silent through similar critiques from Martha Stewart and Gwyneth Paltrow.Two stars can host cooking shows without a feud. Anderson’s light answer suggests she sees no threat. Unless Markle fires back, the story may cool as fast as it boiled up. For viewers, the choice is simple: prime-time garden meals with Pamela or California comfort food with Meghan. Either way, dinner is served.",Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.
