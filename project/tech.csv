Josh Allen And Hailee Steinfeld Out On A Date Night



Hailee Steinfeld Is Fitting In With The Buffalo Bills’ W.A.Gs



The Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen seems to be enjoying his time in Buffalo with his fiancee, actress Hailee Steinfeld . Recently, they were spotted at a fine dine restaurant in Buffalo, New York where Hailee was spotted sipping on a red wine and relaxing while Josh was sporting a black baseball cap and is sipping on a drink. While it is not clear what Josh was sipping on, both Josh and Hailee looked like they were having a good time.The picture was posted by a fan account of Hailee Steinfeld’s on Instagram called “haileesteinfeldhq”.While neither Hailee nor Josh posted anything about their date night , fans have gone into a frenzy as their date night pictures have now gone viral. Though it is not confirmed which fine dine restaurant it is, it looks like eagle eyed fans have started posting that it is the Mulberry’s restaurant in Buffalo, New York.This is the second time in a row that Hailee has been spotted having the time of her life and enjoying herself as she temporarily lives in Buffalo with her fiance Josh. A few days ago, pictures of her had gone viral when she was spotted shopping casually at the Wegmans store for groceries. Fans could not get enough of how Hailee, being an Oscar nominated actress, had no airs about herself and was spotted interacting and posing with her fans.It looks like Hailee, even though has come from a completely different career, has found her spot in the Buffalo Bills. Recently, Josh’s fiancee Hailee was also spotted attending the Buffalo Bills Christmas party where she had a good time with the other wives and girlfriends of the Buffalo Bills’ players. Hailee looked stunning at this Christmas party as she turned up in a full sleeved red dress with a thigh slit. She opted for a low bun and few side fringes and kept her makeup very minimal.It is not just about the Christmas party though; recently, Shane Buechele, Josh’s teammate and the quarterback of the Buffalo Bills, hosted a baby shower for his wife, Paige Buechele who is currently pregnant with a girl. While it is not confirmed whether Hailee attended the party, she sure made it a point to gift the couple something meaningful that is very close to their heart.Paige posted that Hailee had gifted them a cute onesie that had the words “Boujee and Penelope's new best friend” written on it. For the unversed, Boujee and Penelope are the names of Shane and Paige’s adorable pets.Hailee and Josh met last year after Josh had broken up with a long term ex of his. While both Hailee and Josh remained private about their relationship, they were spotted hanging out with each other quite a lot. In November of this year, Josh hosted a beautiful proposal and proposed to Hailee which Hailee accepted. No wedding date has been confirmed by the couple yet.Also Read: Josh Allen's fiancée Hailee Steinfeld charms fans with her down-to-earth attitude during casual shopping trip at Wegmans in Buffalo","Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld were spotted at a fine dine restaurant in Buffalo, New York.

Patrick Mahomes' third child’s name might follow a unique family tradition as Netflix analysts weigh in on the possible choice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/patrick-mahomes-third-childs-name-might-follow-a-unique-family-tradition-as-netflix-analysts-weigh-in-on-the-possible-choice/articleshow/116801349.cms,"Image via Brittany Mahomes/Instagram

Netflix Analysts Have A New Name For Patrick Mahomes’ Third Child With Wife Brittany Mahomes

Patrick Mahomes Is Not Stressing Out His Wife Brittany Mahomes

Patrick Mahomes is having one of the best years of his life. His team, the Kansas City Chiefs , has entered into the playoffs and he is all set to welcome his third child, a daughter, with his wife, Brittany Mahomes . Recently, the NFL star revealed that his wife is “due any time now” and as per reports, he is gearing up for the birth of his third child.But fans are busy speculating the name of his third child and it looks like Netflix analysts have come up with a probable new name for his third child.As the Kansas City Chiefs won against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Christmas Day, Netflix analysts Nate Burleson, J.J. Watt and Ian Eagle started speculating what can be the name of Patrick’s third child and second daughter. The Netflix analysts were live on air when they came up with the name “Platinum Mahomes”. While this name might sound very unique, there are chances that the NFL star, Patrick and his wife Brittany actually decide to name their child “Platinum Mahomes”.The reason for this is, that fans have noticed a pattern behind the names of Patrick and Brittany’s children. It looks like the couple is obsessed with naming their children as well as their two pets around metals. Their older daughter is named Sterling Skye, their toddler son is named Patrick Bronze Lavon and their pets are named Silver and Steele.This was a humorous take on the naming pattern of Patrick and Brittany’s children and fans could not get enough of it. Fortunately, the fans do not have to wait for too long for the popular couple to reveal the name of their third child.Last week the NFL star and quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs revealed in an interview that his wife, Brittany Mahomes, had told him that he has been stressing her out too much this season. So now Patrick has decided to not keep his wife worried about anything and to manage everything on his own. In the same interview, he also revealed that their third child is “due any time” now and they are currently gearing up for her birth.Patrick’s wife Brittany has been a huge support to him. When Patrick won the MVP in the 2022 NFL season, he had credited his wife and children for the success he has achieved. This has not changed a bit even two years later. Brittany has always been spotted supporting and cheering Travis on. But it looks like her third pregnancy had kept her away from attending the Chiefs vs Steelers game on Christmas day. This also makes sense since Brittany might be very close to her due date and is trying to take care of her health at this time.Also Read: Taylor Swift's $36,000 De Beers earrings shine bright during an unforgettable date night with Travis Kelce in New York City","Netflix Analysts Have A New Name For Patrick Mahomes’ Third Child With Wife Brittany Mahomes.

""I'm only 25. All in due time,""

Formerhas become a potential trade interest for several NBA contenders as the February 18 buyout deadline from his Žalgiris contract approaches, according to NBA insider Marc Stein.The Philadelphia 76ers , Minnesota Timberwolves, Miami Heat, Denver Nuggets, and Boston Celtics have emerged as potential destinations for the 25-year-old guard, who has impressed during his stint in Lithuania.Walker's recent EuroLeague performance, where he averaged 14.7 points across 11 games while shooting 43.7% from the field and 36.8% from beyond the arc, has caught the attention of NBA front offices.Lonnie Walker's journey took an unexpected turn after participating in the Boston Celtics' 2024-25 training camp. Despite showing promise, he didn't secure a roster spot and opted for an opportunity overseas with Žalgiris rather than accepting a G League position with the Maine Celtics.Walker shared on social media, reflecting his optimistic outlook on his basketball future.The former 18th overall pick in the 2018 NBA Draft has already proven his worth at the NBA level. During his four-season tenure with the Spurs, Walker established himself as a reliable scorer, averaging 9.4 points per game. His most recent NBA experience came with the Brooklyn Nets , where he maintained consistent production with 9.7 points, 2.2 rebounds, and 1.3 assists per game while shooting 42% from the field in a bench role.Walker's potential return to the NBA could significantly impact a contending team's rotation, particularly given his demonstrated ability to provide instant offense and perimeter shooting. His experience with both rebuilding teams like the Spurs and contenders like the Los Angeles Lakers has equipped him with valuable perspective and adaptability.The timing of Walker's availability coincides with several playoff contenders looking to strengthen their backcourt depth for the postseason push. His combination of youth, proven NBA experience, and recent strong gameplay in Europe makes him an important mid-season addition for teams seeking high-scoring players off the bench.Also read: LA Lakers Trade Rumor: GM Rob Pelinka eyes five potential center targets including 2-time All-Star following Dorian Finney-Smith trade Teams interested in acquiring Walker will need to move quickly, as the buyout deadline leaves a narrow window for negotiations with both the player and his current club, Žalgiris.Let us know if bring back Lonnie Walker IV to the NBA is a good idea and whether or not you would want to see him play in this league once again.","Lonnie Walker IV has become a potential trade interest for several NBA contenders as the February 18 buyout deadline approaches.

Sandringham's history and royal tensions

Happier times at Sandringham

The Royal Family gathers at King Charles' Sandringham estate in Norfolk each Christmas, continuing a tradition dating back to Queen Victoria. The 20,000-acre estate, purchased in 1862, holds significant historical value for the family. George V, former king of the UK, famously cherished Sandringham, saying, ""Dear old Sandringham, the place I love better than anywhere else in the world."" More than 160 years after it was first acquired by the royal family, the estate remains a cherished setting for the royal Christmas celebrations.The preparations for the holiday include selecting a large Christmas tree from the estate grounds, a tradition started by King Charles' great-great-great-grandfather, Prince Albert. King Charles selects a 20-foot Norfolk spruce tree from the grounds each year. The tree is typically decorated with red, gold, and purple ornaments, along with twinkling Christmas lights. The Grand Staircase is often adorned with festive decorations, and the Waterloo Chamber is transformed into a winter wonderland.The King also approves menus for Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day. The chef traditionally carves the turkey in front of the guests. However, one change King Charles may make concerns the temperature in the home. Prince Harry previously described Sandringham’s temperature as “balmy,” saying, “The corgis always betrayed us. The cool air would make them whimper, and Granny would say: 'Is there a draft?' And then a footman would promptly shut the window.”Guests arrive on Christmas eve based on seniority. As Sandringham is the smallest of the royal residences, some guests may have to sleep in rooms typically reserved for staff. One quirky tradition involves guests weighing themselves upon arrival. A tradition from Edward VII involved weighing guests upon arrival and departure to ensure they were well-fed.The family enjoys afternoon tea at 4 pm, with favorites such as square sandwiches, ham and English mustard, Sage Derby cheese, and Coronation Chicken. Desserts include ginger cake, honey and cream sponge, scones, and a pot of Earl Grey tea.At 6 pm, the family exchanges small, humorous gifts, a nod to the German tradition of ""Heiligabend Bescherung,"" introduced by Prince Albert. Princess Diana once gave Sarah Ferguson a leopard print bath mat, while Kate, Princess of Wales, gifted a ""grow your own girlfriend"" kit to a bachelor Prince Harry.Later in the evening, after the children go to bed, a formal dinner is served for the adults, with men in black tie and women in ballgowns and jewels. The meal is followed by martinis and a lavish four-course feast.Christmas day starts with breakfast and an 11 am church service at St Mary Magdalene Church. The royals greet the crowds as they leave the church. The family returns to Sandringham for pre-lunch drinks, including Veuve Clicquot champagne, and a traditional Christmas dinner at 1 pm. The meal includes turkey, potatoes, vegetables, sprouts, carrots, and parsnips, with Christmas pudding served with brandy butter and brandy sauce, followed by a cheese course with port. The table is decorated with white linen, candelabras, and a sprig of the Holy Thorn, a tradition that dates back before the Reformation.The King's speech is watched on television afterward. The family spends the rest of the afternoon at leisure.In the evening, guests enjoy a buffet of traditional English cuisine, including boar's head, ox tongue, and seafood, along with a table of chocolates and mints.Boxing Day features a hunt for the men, followed by lunch and dinner with traditional dishes. The meal typically consists of hearty fare, such as beef bourguignon with mashed potatoes and red cabbage. For dessert, there is apple pie and Christmas pudding slices fried in unsalted butter. Dinner that evening might feature venison with dauphinoise potatoes and carrots, followed by a chocolate pie made of cream, meringue, and cinnamon.Sandringham has witnessed its share of controversy over the years. Princess Diana, who was often unhappy spending Christmas at the estate, would frequently chat with the staff to avoid family members. Royal chef Darren McGrady recalled how Diana would walk around the kitchen after dinner, seeking refuge from the tight quarters of the estate, which he described as “so compact.”In Andrew Morton's biography, Diana was quoted describing a dramatic row with Prince Charles in 1982 when she was pregnant with Prince William. ""I threw myself down the stairs,"" she reportedly said. ""Charles said I was crying wolf, and I said I felt so desperate, and I was crying my eyes out, and he said: 'I'm not going to listen. You're always doing this to me. I'm going riding now.'""Sandringham also hosted a tense summit in January 2020 between King Charles and his sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, after Harry announced he would step back from royal duties. The meeting led to a public statement from the Queen, wishing Harry and Meghan a “peaceful and happy new life.” Meghan Markle , who enjoyed her first Christmas at Sandringham in 2017, shared a fond memory with her mother. “It’s just like a big family like I always wanted,” she said during a phone call. ""There was just this constant movement and energy and fun."" Prince Harry also spoke of happier times, saying, ""Christmas was fantastic.""","The Royal Family gathers at King Charles' Sandringham estate in Norfolk each Christmas. The 20,000-acre estate, purchased in 1862, holds significant historical value for the family. The preparations for the holiday include selecting a large Christmas tree from the estate grounds.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116668529,imgsize-1041711,width-400,resizemode-4/116668529.jpg"

'Diana hated Sandringham'

‘No boisterous behavior’

Disappointment over gag gifts

Familiar yet unwelcome traditions

Royal experts weigh in

Princess Diana reportedly 'hated' spending Christmas with the royal family at Sandringham Estate in UK. Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, revealed that Diana found the royal holiday traditions “claustrophobic.”Speaking to Fox News Digital, Seward explained that Diana felt constrained by the royal customs, saying she did not want to follow so many rules to enjoy herself. “Diana hated Sandringham,” Seward said. “Even when her romance with Charles was going well, she still didn’t like it… I think she found it claustrophobic because Diana was such a free spirit. She didn’t want to have to enjoy herself with so many rules. [But] they’re not rules. They’re just traditions of royalty.” Seward noted that the order of precedence and other royal traditions made Diana uncomfortable.In his 1992 book Diana: Her True Story, author Andrew Morton recounted Diana’s experience during her first Christmas at Sandringham in 1981. She had given expensive gifts, while the royal family exchanged gag gifts.“It was highly fraught,” Diana told Morton. “I know I gave, but I can’t remember being a receiver. Isn’t that awful? I do all the presents, and Charles signs the cards. [It was] terrifying and so disappointing. No boisterous behavior, lots of tension, silly behavior, silly jokes that outsiders would find odd, but insiders understood.” Diana added, “I sure was [an outsider].”Seward corroborated this story, sharing that a friend who worked at Sandringham witnessed Diana’s disappointment. Diana reportedly gave cashmere sweaters and other expensive items but received a simple, less thoughtful gift in return. “She just couldn’t understand [it],” Seward said. “To her, Christmas was all about spending a bit more than you could probably afford and getting really nice presents.”Despite her dislike for the traditions, Diana was familiar with Sandringham as her father had a house on the estate. However, her hairdresser, Richard Dalton, told author Kitty Kelley that Diana “hated going to Sandringham for Christmas,” mentioning the cold and the requirement to watch the Queen’s Christmas message on television. Dalton referred to it as a “command performance.” An unnamed friend also told author Tina Brown that Diana dreaded going to Sandringham.Royal experts shared their views on Diana’s experience at Sandringham. Hilary Fordwich explained that Diana’s gift-giving experience was “embarrassing and painful,” as she wasn’t aware of the family’s gag gift tradition. Nick Bullen, co-founder of True Royalty TV, commented that the royals exchange “silly joke presents,” with author Christopher Andersen noting that Queen Elizabeth II preferred gag gifts. Andersen also claimed that Prince Charles’ favorite gift was a toilet seat from Princess Anne.King Charles and Diana had separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996.","Princess Diana reportedly 'hated' spending Christmas with the royal family at Sandringham Estate in UK.

Is Netflix over Harry and Meghan? 'Exhausted' execs pin hopes on Sussexes’ cookery show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/is-netflix-over-harry-and-meghan-exhausted-execs-pin-hopes-on-sussexes-cookery-show/articleshow/116359484.cms,"As per the sources, Netflix executives are “exhausted” from working with Markle.

Polo flops and “box office poison” drama

Cookery show under pressure

The Sussex struggle: From Hollywood darlings to “colossal bombs”

Crisis control or end of the road?

It seems like the honeymoon phase between Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, and Netflix is officially over. Once hailed as the streaming platform’s dream duo, the Sussexes’ partnership with Netflix has hit a rough patch, with insiders whispering about mounting frustration and dwindling faith in their ability to deliver hits.The latest debacle? Their five-part documentary about polo, which critics have torched as a “tedious inside look” and a “dull indulgence.” One reviewer even joked it felt like a spoof designed to play in the background of Succession.As per the sources quoted by the Daily Mail, Netflix executives are “exhausted” from working with Markle. The fallout is apparently so bad that her upcoming cookery show—still without a premiere date—is being labeled as her “make or break” moment. “It’s so much work with her, and, bluntly, the ‘deliverable’ does not seem to be worth it,” one insider said.Adding fuel to the fire, there’s been zero buzz around the polo series. No press tours, no promotional events, no hype. Even Nacho Figueras, Harry’s polo pal and a star of the series, has barely mentioned it on social media. Hollywood veteran Sean McNulty told The Daily Beast: “The lack of a proper press campaign for a Harry and Meghan project is eyebrow-raising, to say the least.”According to reports, Meghan’s cookery show is now the Sussexes’ last hope at staying in Netflix’s good graces. One entertainment exec was quotes by the Daily Mail as saying, “Her show will have to be an enormous hit to turn around their deal and their reputations in this town.”The show is expected to drop in early 2024, coinciding with Harry’s appearance at the Winter Invictus Games in Canada and the launch of Meghan’s homeware brand, American Riviera Orchard . Talk about multitasking under pressure.Critics are having a field day with Harry and Meghan’s current reputation—or lack thereof. Marketing expert Tony Case didn’t mince words, was quoted by the Daily Beast as saying, “Harry and Meghan are box office poison. Everyone is running away from this colossal bomb.”He added, “They set out to conquer America, but no one here found them—or what they’re selling—to be particularly compelling.”Even their highly-publicized project Meet Me at the Lake, based on a best-selling novel, remains in limbo. With no production in sight, it’s unlikely to materialize before their Netflix deal is up for renewal next year.Friends who once hyped their projects are unusually quiet, fueling speculation that Hollywood may be losing patience with the couple. A source quoted in Closer Magazine tried to defend the Sussexes, blaming Netflix for pushing a “reality TV angle” that was out of their control.","The Sussexes’ partnership with Netflix has hit a rough patch, with insiders whispering about mounting frustration and dwindling faith in their ability to deliver hits. “It’s so much work with her, and, bluntly, the ‘deliverable’ does not seem to be worth it,” one insider said.

Plans to expose OpenAI

Questions surrounding his death

‘He wouldn’t take his own life’

Appeal for justice

The family of Suchir Balaji , a 26-year-old whistleblower who accused OpenAI of copyright infringements, has disclosed that he was preparing to take legal action against the company before his untimely death. Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on November 27, with the city’s Chief Medical Examiner ruling it a suicide. However, his parents, speaking with Republic World, have raised suspicions of foul play, insisting their son was ""courageous"" and unlikely to end his own life.According to his mother, Poornima Ramarao, Suchir had compiled evidence to support his claims and had arranged interviews with major media outlets, including the Associated Press, to shed light on OpenAI’s alleged copyright violations.“He told me he was working on personal research,” Poornima said, adding that he brushed off her concerns, assuring her that he had done nothing wrong.The family revealed that Suchir had a document outlining his accusations and legal strategy. “He was ready to go public in a big way,” his mother said.Suchir’s parents became alarmed after not hearing from him for several days and contacted police, who discovered his body in his apartment. Poornima expressed doubts about the circumstances of his death, claiming that key details “don’t add up.”The family noted unusual activity on his devices after his death, including temporary files from Google Chrome and Google Drive appearing on November 29—two days after his body was found. “We are investigating who accessed his desktop,” Poornima said, emphasizing their commitment to conducting a thorough forensic analysis of his laptop and other devices.Poornima described her son as upbeat and happy in the days leading up to his death. He had celebrated his birthday with friends and enjoyed a vacation in Los Angeles and Catalina Island just a week prior. “He was full of life,” she said. “Someone so bold and self-assured wouldn’t take such a step.”The family has vowed to uncover the truth behind Suchir’s death, suspecting that his whistleblowing may have led to threats or intimidation. They have called for an independent investigation and have sought support from influential figures like Elon Musk.“This involves hundreds of billions of dollars,” Poornima said. “We need someone powerful to help us get to the bottom of this.”","Suchir Balaji, 26, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on November 27.

Why Don Lemon cackled maniacally and trashed MAGA fans as ‘Dumb f***ing idiots’ over H-1B visa feud with Musk; Social media reacts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-don-lemon-cackled-maniacally-and-trashed-maga-fans-as-dumb-fing-idiots-over-h-1b-visa-feud-with-musk-social-media-reacts/articleshow/116812682.cms,"Independent media personality Don Lemon haughtily cackled during an expletive-laden screed over the MAGA world flare-up over H1-B visas for specialty workers.

Social media reacts to Lemon’s rant

'Too delicious to ignore'

The Post

Don Lemon didn’t just comment on the latest MAGA drama — he gleefully tore into it. In a scathing, profanity-laced tirade that has since gone viral, the independent media personality mocked Trump supporters for their shocking inability to see through Elon Musk ’s support of H-1B visas, sparking a meltdown in the MAGA world.Lemon’s notorious maniacal cackle took center stage during his YouTube rant, where he mocked Trump fans as “dumb f***king idiots” for being blindsided by Musk’s position on the H-1B visa program. “You dumb f***king idiots! Now you’re just figuring this sh** out,” Lemon sneered, clearly relishing the spectacle of MAGA's internal strife.The chaos erupted after Musk and tech mogul Vivek Ramaswamy — both major figures in Trump’s orbit — threw their support behind the H-1B visa system, which allows US companies to hire skilled foreign workers when they can't find enough Americans to fill the roles. The backlash was swift from staunch MAGA supporters, with figures like Laura Loomer slamming the move, accusing Musk of betraying the populist, anti-immigration cause.But Lemon wasn’t done. As the MAGA infighting escalated, he went on to tear apart the very core of Trump’s movement. “You have stupid MAGA brain,” he ranted, accusing Trump supporters of being too blinded by their allegiance to the former president to see what was really happening. “You’re in a f***king cult and you don’t even realize it,” Lemon added, mocking their lack of self-awareness.The comment seemed to be a direct jab at the MAGA base’s unwavering loyalty to Trump — even when he’s surrounded by figures like Musk, who have increasingly aligned with policies that conflict with the populist movement's anti-immigrant stance.The internet was quick to react to Lemon’s fiery outburst, with many users taking to social media to voice their opinions.One user commented, “Holy shit Don Lemon has officially lost his damn mind.” Another added, “He does sound hormonal af.”Another user took a shot at Lemon’s career, saying, “Since being fired from CNN, Don Lemon's career has crashed faster than Biden from sundowning. While Lemon pretended he left for his fake Liberal virtue, he really left because his ego couldn’t handle the mocking he received after his contract fell through. As you can see from this video, Lemon's situation is not improving. He should join Mark Hamil and Rob Reiner in the mental health facility. Don Lemon's video is not the flex on MAGA he thinks it is. Enjoy the meltdown.”Others took a more critical stance: “He’s hit rock bottom. I’m trying to find the interview where he asks random people whether they think Elon is actually the president. He cites MSM and gets laughed at.”One user remarked, “Don Lemon appears to be losing his mind. What stage of grief is this? ‘You’ve been co-opted into a cult and you don’t even realize it because you have stupid MAGA brain and you don’t get it. How stupid and dumb are you?’ Projection 101.”A more thought-provoking response came from another user who wrote, “The right hates Don Lemon because he’s black, intelligent, articulate, and factually points out what MAGA doesn’t want to acknowledge about themselves and their cult-like movement & leader. MAGA hates intelligent people of color.”Lemon’s rant also alluded to Trump’s controversial remark earlier this year about immigrants taking away “black jobs.” “Who’s to say that one of those jobs might be a ‘white job’?” Lemon chuckled, further driving the point home that MAGA’s rhetoric is often contradictory, especially as the conversation shifts on issues like immigration.Even as Musk and Ramaswamy defended the H-1B program, claiming it needed reform, the growing tension within MAGA ranks was undeniable. Trump himself later weighed in, telling, “I’ve always liked the visas. I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them.”For Lemon, it was all too delicious to ignore. Once a CNN anchor who found himself at the center of controversy over remarks about Nikki Haley, Lemon has embraced his role as an outspoken critic. With his latest rant, he’s shown that he’s not afraid to go for the jugular — especially when MAGA’s contradictions create the perfect storm for drama.","Independent media personality Don Lemon's expletive-laced tirade over the MAGA world flare-up has gone viral. Lemon mocked Trump supporters for their shocking inability to see through Elon Musk ’s support of H-1B visas. The internet was quick to react to Lemon's fiery outburst, with many users taking to social media to voice their opinions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116812994,imgsize-50050,width-400,resizemode-4/116812994.jpg"

If you understood what you read so far—congratulations—you are up to date with the changing lingo. If some of the slang confused you, here is a brush-up of words that became a sensation this year.Each year, leading dictionaries select words that encapsulate the prevailing cultural, political, and social climates. Every generation tends to come up with its own terms that help them evade their parents' understanding.Here are some of the words that gained massive popularity this year:Oxford University Press designated 'brain rot' as its word of the year for 2024. The term describes the deterioration of mental state due to over-consumption of poor content. The phrase saw a 230% increase in usage from the previous year, highlighting growing concerns about the effects of low-quality digital media on cognitive health.Interestingly, 'brain rot' is not a modern coinage; its earliest use dates to 1854 in Henry David Thoreau's. However, it has gained renewed relevance in the digital era.Scrolling Instagram at 3 am? That’s pure brain rot, mate.Dictionary.com announced 'demure' as its word of the year for 2024. Traditionally meaning reserved, modest, or shy, the term experienced a resurgence in popularity, largely due to a viral trend initiated by Chicago-based content creator Jools Lebron. Her catchphrase 'very demure, very mindful' became widely adopted on social media platforms, leading to a significant increase in searches for the term.She walked into the party looking very demure, but trust me, she’s the loudest one when the music drops.Cambridge Dictionary's word of the year is 'manifest,' reflecting the trend of individuals using positive thoughts (vibes), visualisation, and affirmation techniques to achieve personal goals.The practice of 'manifesting' gained popularity during the pandemic and continued to be significant in 2024, with the term being looked up almost 130,000 times on the Cambridge Dictionary website.He is obsessed with manifesting his way to riches and romance.Merriam-Webster chose 'polarisation' as its word of the year for 2024. Defined as the division into two sharply contrasting sets of beliefs, the term reflects the deepening divisions within the United States, especially in the context of the recent presidential election.It underscores a societal trend towards extremes, with diminishing middle ground in political and cultural discourse.Group chats these days are all about polarisation—either you’re a Swiftie, or you’re wrong.Collins Dictionary selected 'brat' as its word of the year for 2024. Popularised by British pop star Charli XCX's album titled, the term has come to symbolise a confident and rebellious attitude. In Charli’s own words, the essence of brat can be summarised as 'a pack of cigs, a Bic lighter, and a strappy white top with no bra.'It fuelled Kamala Harris' campaign for the US presidential elections when Charli tweeted, 'Kamala IS brat.' However, it differs from the original meaning of behaving like one is entitled or difficult to deal with.He’s not being rude, he’s just living his brat era.Originally, 'rawdogging' referred to having sex without protection. Collins Dictionary describes 'rawdogging' as the act of undertaking an activity without preparation, support, or equipment. This lack of preparation is typically considered essential and often done out of carelessness.Rawdogging implies a disregard for potential consequences or discomfort. For example, in a TikTok trend, the 'rawdogging travel challenge' expected plane passengers to sit silently without movies, music, distractions, or even sleep.I can’t believe some of you are out there in this pollution, rawdogging without masks.'Looksmaxxing' is the process of enhancing one's physical appearance, whether through skincare routines, workouts, or even going under the knife. The term originated on male incel message boards in the 2010s and became popular on TikTok in the 2020s.Some practices associated with 'looksmaxxing' include 'softmaxxing' (skincare, exercise, fashion sense), 'hardmaxxing' (cosmetic surgeries), and 'mewing' (placing the tongue in a way that improves jawline and facial structure).She’s deep in her looksmaxxing era—facials, gym, and a whole new wardrobe.The Economist’s word of the year for 2024 is 'kakistocracy,' which is defined as the government run by the worst—least suitable, intelligent, or experienced people. The word saw a surge in online searches a day after Donald Trump won the US elections and again following his recent nominations.The heightened interest in 'kakistocracy' reflects anxieties surrounding the new administration. It captures concerns shared by many in the US and globally, leading to its selection as word of the year.Twitter is basically a kakistocracy with Elon running the show.Traditionally, lavender marriages involved a heterosexual person and a homosexual person concealing the latter's sexual orientation due to societal pressures. Lavender, in this context, symbolised the LGBTQ+ community.However, some in Gen Z are considering these marriages for different reasons. They seek platonic partners to share living expenses and create stable relationships, driven by frustrations with modern dating. These marriages are not entered into to hide sexuality.A lavender marriage sounds ideal—no drama, just vibes and rent-sharing.These selections offer a linguistic snapshot of 2024, underscoring how language evolves in response to current events and cultural shifts, providing insight into the collective consciousness of the time.","Oxford University Press designated 'brain rot' as its word of the year for 2024.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Spangram for today

Today's Strands’ answers:

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Google’s Doodle New Year’s Eve and ringing in 2025

As 2024 approaches the end, Google welcomes 2025 with a beautiful New Year's Eve Doodle. Bright and bold purple letters ""Google"" are written against the starry night sky while a ticking clock in the shape of the ""O"" of ""Google"" serves to count down the remaining minutes until midnight. The new year brings a certain energy and anticipation with it.The Doodle also, in this case, nudges people to take cognizance of how the previous year was and await the upcoming year, full of different opportunities for change in their lives. New Year's Eve is a time celebrated all over the world, for both personal reflection and new beginnings, marked by the different types of festivities, traditions, and resolutions. Whether spent in grand celebrations or quiet contemplation, the occasion symbolizes hope for the future.Google has created a vibrant New Year's Eve Doodle to herald the close of 2024 and usher in 2025. The bold purple lettering of ""Google"" is set against the night sky with stars in it, and where the usual ""O"" of the logo would be is a clock ticking away. It is subtle but strikingly so because that closeness of one year to another sends forth excitement and anticipation.Accompanying the Doodle, Google released a blog post stating, ""Bust out your sparkles and finalize your resolutions — today's Doodle celebrates New Year's Eve! Here's to a new year that's shining with opportunity — just like today's Doodle! Let the countdown begin."" The Doodle was made available worldwide, thus helping people around the globe reflect on the past year and prepare for the coming year, all while having fun celebrating the moment.New Year's Eve was the widely celebrated New Year's Day eve within virtually all cultures, leaving them a chance for time to reflect on past changes while awaiting new prospects with challenges in the ensuing periods. Most of these end up spending the nights celebrating boisterously, lit in fireworks, and merry get-togethers for others or in calm individual reflection. Regardless of what one has used to express celebration, New Year's Eve epitomizes both the notion of letting go of what was and entering a new. In multiple cultures, the night itself has been known for certain aspects of ritual; for example, special dishes meant to impart good luck have been served, or people have formulated resolutions for the new year. This only shows that most people all over the globe share one common hope to have a better future filled with opportunities and growth.Google Doodle, paired with the blog post by Google, challenged the users of the internet to reflect upon personal goals for the upcoming year. The Doodle and its message are a perfect representation of a new start and what new achievements have in store, just as making New Year's resolutions. Typically, people make these resolutions because it's a new chance to make their lives better-to lead healthier lifestyles, work on personal development, and undertake new challenges. In so many ways, that feeling of making resolutions goes along with the optimism and promise of the new year. Google's blog posting speaks to the theme of reflection and the need for a fresh start to push aside the struggles of the past and celebrate the opportunities found ahead.Fireworks illuminated the sky at night.

Hacked Chrome extensions put Facebook Ads users at risk; these are the versions impacted,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/hacked-chrome-extensions-put-facebook-ads-users-at-risk-these-are-the-versions-impacted/articleshow/116804591.cms,"Which Google Chrome versions are impacted

Hackers have injected harmful code into several Google Chrome extensions, targeting users of Facebook Ads. Cybersecurity firm Cyberhaven revealed that the malicious extensions were designed to steal sensitive information like access tokens, user IDs, account details, and cookies. This puts Facebook Ads users at serious risk of data theft and account hacking.In a blog post, Cyberhaven reported that its own Chrome extension was hacked on December 24 in an attack aimed at social media advertising and AI platform logins. Other extensions, such as ParrotTalks, Uvoice, and VPNCity, were also impacted starting in mid-December, according to Jaime Blasco from Nudge Security, as reported by Reuters.The breach was first detected on December 25, and researchers quickly removed the harmful version of the extension within an hour.“On December 24, a phishing attack compromised a Cyberhaven employee's credentials to the Google Chrome Web Store. The attacker used these credentials to publish a malicious version of our Chrome extension (version 24.10.4). Our security team detected this compromise at 11:54 PM UTC on December 25 and removed the malicious package within 60 minutes,” Cyberhaven said in a blog post.According to Cyberhaven, the incident was brief and limited in scope. Only version 24.10.4 of the Cyberhaven Chrome extension was affected, and the malicious code was active from 1:32 AM UTC on December 25 to 2:50 AM UTC on December 26. Chrome browsers that auto-updated the extension during this time were impacted.The company clarified, ""Our investigation found that no other Cyberhaven systems were compromised."" For affected browsers, the malicious code may have stolen cookies and login sessions from certain websites. Initial findings suggest the attacker specifically targeted logins to social media advertising and AI platforms.","Hackers have injected harmful code into several Google Chrome extensions, targeting users of Facebook Ads.

"Spotify’s search results are exposing users to adult content, what the company has to say",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/spotifys-search-results-are-exposing-users-to-adult-content-what-the-company-has-to-say/articleshow/116803090.cms,"What Spotify has to say

Spotify is once again facing scrutiny over adult content slipping through its moderation filters and appearing in search results on the app. As per a report, a search for rapper M.I.A. yielded a pornographic video among the suggested results.A Reddit user exposed the issue by sharing a screenshot of the search results, The Verge reported, adding that it is unable to replicate the original finding but uncovered other sexually explicit videos hidden within the “Video” tab of Spotify's search results.These videos, often uploaded by accounts with generic or nonsensical names on the popular music streaming service, appear to exploit a loophole in Spotify's podcast moderation system.Spotify spokesperson Laura Batey told The Verge that the reported videos have been removed for violating the platform's policies, which explicitly prohibit sexually explicit material. However, an explanation for how these videos bypassed their moderation process has purportedly not been addressed.This latest incident highlights an ongoing problem for Spotify. Users have previously reported encountering explicit content in search results, algorithmic playlists, and even disguised as erotic audio tracks. In 2022, Vice also documented the prevalence of sexually explicit audio and graphic images on the platform.Recently, a report revealed that the platform is being exploited to spread malware, pirated software, and spam through playlists and podcasts. Security researchers discovered that malicious actors have been using playlist and podcast descriptions to distribute links to harmful websites and illicit content.These malicious actors are exploiting Spotify's search engine optimisation (SEO) to reach a wider audience. Even if Spotify blocks certain keywords on its platform, searching for those keywords on Google can still lead users to malicious links hosted within Spotify playlists and podcasts.Furthermore, spammers are using misleading tactics to attract unsuspecting users. They often employ irrelevant audio content and titles related to trending topics, like TikTok or adult content, to increase visibility in search results.","A search for rapper M.I.A. yielded a pornographic video among the suggested results.
