Where is Hailey Welch? The 'Hawk Tuah' star 'vanishes' after memecoin $HAWK collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/where-is-hailey-welch-the-hawk-tuah-star-vanishes-after-memecoin-hawk-collapse/articleshow/116486463.cms,"After her viral ""Hawk Tuah"" video exploded across the internet, Welch turned the catchphrase into a full-fledged brand.

Hailey Welch , the viral sensation behind the "" Hawk Tuah "" catchphrase, has disappeared from the public eye—leaving her millions of fans wondering what happened.The last episode of her hit podcast Talk Tuah aired on Dec. 3, and since then, Welch has gone silent. No updates on her social media, no new episodes of her popular podcast, and no word on her whereabouts. Her fans, who had been riding high on her meteoric rise, are now left puzzled and frustrated.Welch’s sudden rise to fame seemed like a fairy tale. After her viral ""Hawk Tuah"" video exploded across the internet, Welch turned the catchphrase into a full-fledged brand. She launched merchandise and then, in September, a weekly podcast that soared to the top of the Spotify charts. Everything seemed to be falling into place for the influencer-turned-entrepreneur.But things took a turn when Welch launched her own cryptocurrency—$HAWK, the Hawk Tuah memecoin—on Dec. 4. Initially, the coin soared in value, briefly reaching a market cap of hundreds of millions of dollars. However, within minutes, it collapsed, wiping out the investments of countless fans. Many speculated that insiders had dumped their tokens, profiting off the crash while leaving regular buyers to bear the losses.Welch's attempt to address the controversy only deepened the mystery. During a live audio stream on X (formerly Twitter) with her partners at OverHere , who helped launch the memecoin, Welch appeared to brush off the criticisms. ""Hey guys! I hate to interrupt you, Nick, but hello there. Anywho, I'm gonna go to bed and I'll see you guys tomorrow,"" she casually remarked, before abruptly leaving the conversation. That was the last anyone heard from Welch.Her sudden exit has sparked a mix of reactions online. Some are calling it a “career-ending move,” while others seem more sympathetic, jokingly referring to her as “Sleeping Beauty.” One user remarked, ""Her career ended in the same year it started.""But the saga of the $HAWK coin is far from over. While Welch remains silent, her crypto partners have made public statements, attempting to shift blame onto Alex Larson Schultz, known as ""Doc Hollywood."" OverHere alleges that Schultz was in charge of key decisions related to the coin, including token distribution and financial management. Schultz, who is a music producer and the son-in-law of comedian Howie Mandel, has not yet commented on these accusations.As Welch remains unreachable, the controversy continues to grow. On Dec. 7, investors who lost money in the $HAWK collapse filed a lawsuit, accusing the creators of selling unregistered securities.For now, the public is left waiting—both for Welch’s next move and for the next chapter in the $HAWK memecoin disaster .","Hailey Welch, the viral sensation behind the "" Hawk Tuah "" catchphrase, has disappeared from the public eye.

Former WWE Heavyweight Champion Rey Mysterio Grants 100th Wish

WWE Hall of Famer Rey Mysterio has been in the company for quite some time now, and has multiple accolades to his name. However, recently, he achieved a very special and wholesome milestone that not many wrestlers have even to this day.Now, apart from being professional wrestlers, these individuals are also involved in a lot of charities and do a lot for the community.

Mysterio is one of the many wrestlers who is associated with this foundation and recently hit a milestone with them.Over their tenure with the company, WWE wrestlers grant a lot of wishes with the Make-a-wish Foundation. However, not many have managed to hit the 100 wishes milestone. While it’s an achievement, it’s still something that Mysterio should be proud of.To commemorate the achievement, he was gifted a custom mask by CEO Leslie Motter. The mask has been a consistent part of his in-ring gear and his overall persona as well. In fact, it’s never been so that Rey Mysterio has been spotted without his mask ever.This mask has a blue base color and bears a design similar to what he has been wearing since his in-ring debut. He took off the mask that he was wearing to put on the mask at the event itself, but it’ll be interesting to see if he ever wears it into the ring.Fans were really touched by his gesture and had very kind words to say for him. One fan said, “I met Rey here in Australia back in the WWE Tour of 2015. He was such a gentleman and very friendly to my wife and I and our two sons. Love you Rey,” while another fan said, “Always been my fave wrestler since day 1 of watching wwe.”Also read: Former WWE Champion Sheds Light on Mental Health Struggles They Faced in WWE It’s also worth noting that Rey Mysterio attended the event wearing an Eddie Guererro shirt, a wrestler who was a friend and a wrestling legend.

The crew failed to stop the leakage despite their best efforts.“It was utter disbelief and a little panic,” Blazevic recounted, explaining how passengers scrambled to lift their feet and belongings out of the “disgusting” water pooling on the floor.A viral TikTok video, which has now garnered over 7.2 million views, captured the chaos onboard. The clip, humorously set to Céline Dion’s My heart will go on, the theme song from the 1997 Titanic film — showed panicked passengers trying to escape the gush. A content creator even quipped in the video caption, “The in-flight movie was Titanic.”Comments flooded in online, with many likening the ordeal to a scene from the Final Destination franchise. “Imagine drowning…on a plane…in the air,” one user wrote. Another added, “New final destination fear unlocked.”While the incident was unnerving, it wasn’t the only frightening event for flyers in recent months.

Millions more unwanted and potentially dangerous messages were blocked before they even reached inboxes,” said Google in a blog post.Here’s Google shared a scam warning and tips to keep you safe.* Phishing scams : These emails often come disguised as greetings or order confirmations from legitimate companies. They may contain malicious links or attachments that can steal your personal information or infect your device with malware.* Fake shipping notifications: Fraudsters may impersonate delivery services to trick you into clicking on links or providing sensitive information like passwords or credit card details.* Spoofed charity appeals: These emails manipulate users' generosity by posing as reputable charities. Always research the organization before donating online.Fortunately, Gmail offers several robust security features to protect users from scams:* Spam filters: Gmail automatically filters out a significant amount of spam and phishing emails.* Warning labels: Many suspicious emails are clearly marked with warnings like ""Be careful with this message"" or ""External sender.""* Two-factor authentication: This extra layer of security makes it harder for unauthorised users to access your account even if they possess your password.* Beware of unsolicited emails: Don't click on links or open attachments in emails from unknown senders.* Verify sender addresses: Double-check the email address before clicking on anything. Legitimate companies will use their official domains.* Don't be pressured into acting fast: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to pressure you into making mistakes.* Research before donating: Before you donate to a charity, research them online to ensure their legitimacy.* Report suspicious emails: Report any suspicious emails to Google to help improve its spam filters.","Google is reminding Gmail users to be vigilant against festive scams.

Donald and Melania Trump's kiss at basketball game goes viral: 'Let the woman breathe',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-and-melania-trumps-kiss-at-basketball-game-goes-viral-let-the-woman-breathe/articleshow/116487051.cms,"Viral photo of Trump kissing Melania (Picture credit: X)

Social media reactions

A flashback to a different moment

Melania’s limited public role

A love story spanning decades

A photo of US President-elect Donald Trump sharing a kiss with his wife, Melania , at a baseball game is going viral, with social media buzzing with mixed reactions.In the image, Trump, dressed in a suit with a peach-colored tie, is seen kissing Melania, who is wearing a black dress. The couple is seated in the stadium, surrounded by spectators—some smiling at the affectionate moment, while others continue to focus on the game. The candid image has captured the attention of many, fueling a variety of reactions online.Social media users are divided, with many expressing affection for the couple’s public display of love. One user commented, ""Mom and Dad are so adorable!"" while another quipped, ""Let the woman breathe."" Others shared their admiration, saying things like, ""Now THAT is how to handle the kiss cam kiss!"" Some fans even joked about wishing they could be in Melania's place.This viral moment comes on the heels of a less affectionate public appearance earlier this year. In July, a video surfaced showing Melania Trump avoiding a kiss from her husband during his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention . As Trump leaned in to kiss Melania after securing the Republican nomination for 2024, she appeared to subtly sidestep the gesture, sparking widespread commentary and speculation across social media.Since the start of Trump’s second presidential campaign, Melania has kept a relatively low public profile. She has appeared at select events, such as the Republican National Convention and the Al Smith dinner in New York, but has remained mostly out of the spotlight. Much of her time has been focused on supporting her son Barron as he transitions to college life at New York University. Balancing her life between New York and Palm Beach, Melania’s decision to prioritize family has contributed to her quieter role during the campaign.Trump has shared that his wife will participate in his second term as First Lady as needed, assuring her supporters that she will be involved at appropriate moments.The couple's love story began in 2004 when Trump proposed to Melania at the Met Gala. They married in 2005 at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, and in 2006, welcomed their son Barron. Over the years, they’ve shared many significant moments together, and this latest viral kiss is just another chapter in their public life as a married couple.While social media continues to react to the photo, one thing is clear: Donald and Melania Trump’s relationship remains a focal point of public interest as they continue their journey in the political spotlight.","A photo of US President-elect Donald Trump sharing a kiss with his wife, Melania, at a baseball game is going viral.

Is Netflix over Harry and Meghan? 'Exhausted' execs pin hopes on Sussexes’ cookery show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/is-netflix-over-harry-and-meghan-exhausted-execs-pin-hopes-on-sussexes-cookery-show/articleshow/116359484.cms,"As per the sources, Netflix executives are “exhausted” from working with Markle.

Polo flops and “box office poison” drama

Cookery show under pressure

The Sussex struggle: From Hollywood darlings to “colossal bombs”

Crisis control or end of the road?

It seems like the honeymoon phase between Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, and Netflix is officially over. Once hailed as the streaming platform’s dream duo, the Sussexes’ partnership with Netflix has hit a rough patch, with insiders whispering about mounting frustration and dwindling faith in their ability to deliver hits.The latest debacle? Their five-part documentary about polo, which critics have torched as a “tedious inside look” and a “dull indulgence.” One reviewer even joked it felt like a spoof designed to play in the background of Succession.As per the sources quoted by the Daily Mail, Netflix executives are “exhausted” from working with Markle. The fallout is apparently so bad that her upcoming cookery show—still without a premiere date—is being labeled as her “make or break” moment. “It’s so much work with her, and, bluntly, the ‘deliverable’ does not seem to be worth it,” one insider said.Adding fuel to the fire, there’s been zero buzz around the polo series. No press tours, no promotional events, no hype. Even Nacho Figueras, Harry’s polo pal and a star of the series, has barely mentioned it on social media. Hollywood veteran Sean McNulty told The Daily Beast: “The lack of a proper press campaign for a Harry and Meghan project is eyebrow-raising, to say the least.”According to reports, Meghan’s cookery show is now the Sussexes’ last hope at staying in Netflix’s good graces. One entertainment exec was quotes by the Daily Mail as saying, “Her show will have to be an enormous hit to turn around their deal and their reputations in this town.”The show is expected to drop in early 2024, coinciding with Harry’s appearance at the Winter Invictus Games in Canada and the launch of Meghan’s homeware brand, American Riviera Orchard . Talk about multitasking under pressure.Critics are having a field day with Harry and Meghan’s current reputation—or lack thereof. Marketing expert Tony Case didn’t mince words, was quoted by the Daily Beast as saying, “Harry and Meghan are box office poison. Everyone is running away from this colossal bomb.”He added, “They set out to conquer America, but no one here found them—or what they’re selling—to be particularly compelling.”Even their highly-publicized project Meet Me at the Lake, based on a best-selling novel, remains in limbo. With no production in sight, it’s unlikely to materialize before their Netflix deal is up for renewal next year.Friends who once hyped their projects are unusually quiet, fueling speculation that Hollywood may be losing patience with the couple. A source quoted in Closer Magazine tried to defend the Sussexes, blaming Netflix for pushing a “reality TV angle” that was out of their control.","The Sussexes’ partnership with Netflix has hit a rough patch, with insiders whispering about mounting frustration and dwindling faith in their ability to deliver hits. “It’s so much work with her, and, bluntly, the ‘deliverable’ does not seem to be worth it,” one insider said.

"Iranian singer Parastoo Ahmadi performs online concert without hijab, faces prosecution",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iranian-singer-performs-online-concert-without-hijab-faces-prosecution/articleshow/116256617.cms,"Iranian singer performs online concert without hijab, faces prosecution

An Iranian singer faces prosecution after performing an online concert without a hijab, violating Iran's dress code. The judiciary announced legal action against the singer and production staff on Thursday. The concert was streamed on YouTube and featured the singer, Parastoo Ahmadi , bare-shouldered in a black dress, performing with a three-man band.The concert appears to have been filmed in Iran at a traditional caravanserai. Iranian law requires women to cover their hair in public and prohibits them from singing solo publicly. Ahmadi had previously gained a following on Instagram, posting videos and audio clips of herself singing without a headscarf, often in support of the 2022-2023 protests.A message preceding the concert on YouTube stated: ""I am Parastoo, the girl who cannot remain silent and refuses to stop singing for the country she loves."" She encouraged viewers to ""listen to my voice in this imaginary concert and dream of a free and beautiful nation"".The Iranian judiciary, without naming Ahmadi, stated that legal action was taken against “a group led by a female singer” who performed “music without observing legal and religious standards.”US-based activist Masih Alinejad called the concert “historic,” stating that “her voice is a weapon against tyranny, her courage a song of defiance.” Commentator Karim Sadjadpour described the concert as an “act of extraordinary courage” and “another crack in the foundations of Iran's rotting theocracy.”This event comes before a new law, expected Friday, which rights groups say will increase penalties for women violating the dress code.","Iranian singer Parastoo Ahmadi performs online concert without hijab, faces prosecution.

"'No burgers, soft drinks and burgers': UK bans daytime TV ads for junk food in bid to tackle child obesity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/no-burgers-soft-drinks-and-burgers-uk-bans-daytime-tv-ads-for-junk-food-in-bid-to-tackle-child-obesity/articleshow/116004661.cms,"Rising child obesity in UK

What will be covered in the ambit of the ban?

The UK government has announced a ban on daytime TV adverts for sugary foods, including popular items like granola, muffins, and pastries, as part of its ongoing efforts to combat rising childhood obesity.News agency AFP reported that the new regulations, set to take effect in October next year, will restrict ads for “less healthy” food and drinks to airing only after the 9:00 pm watershed.The ban targets specific products identified as unhealthy based on their sugar, fat, and salt content, but does not apply to the broader advertising of fast food chains. For example, ads from fast food restaurants will remain permissible as long as they do not feature specific items like burgers or fries, according to a BBC report.Highlighting the importance of these measures, health secretary Wes Streeting said, “Obesity robs our kids of the best possible start in life, sets them up for a lifetime of health problems, and costs the NHS billions. This government is taking action now to end the targeting of junk food ads at kids, across both TV and online.”According to the National Health Service (NHS), obesity rates among children in the UK are on the rise, with one in 10 four-year-olds now classified as obese. Additionally, one in five five-year-olds suffers from tooth decay linked to excessive sugar consumption. The government’s new approach aims to address these alarming statistics and prevent further health complications down the line.The ban includes a variety of items that are commonly marketed to children, such as fast food, soft drinks, ready meals, and pre-packaged sugary breakfast foods. Products like croissants, pancakes, waffles, cereal bars, and sweetened yoghurts will be affected, alongside chickpea or lentil-based crisps, seaweed snacks, energy drinks, and processed foods like hamburgers and chicken nuggets.However, healthier alternatives will be exempt from the restrictions. Natural porridge oats and unsweetened yoghurt, for instance, will not fall under the new rules.The government hopes that by reducing the exposure of children to these adverts, it can help prevent an estimated 20,000 cases of childhood obesity each year.","The UK government has announced a ban on daytime TV adverts for sugary foods.

The mixed reactions

Stevenson's journey as a new mom

Influencer Sarah Stevenson , known as Sarah’s Day online, has ignited a heated debate on social media after offering her own breast milk to her teammates and family members at a boat party . The unconventional act, captured in a video shared with her followers, has left the internet divided, with reactions ranging from support to disgust.“Are they really true friends if they don’t try your freshly pumped breastmilk!? Is it just me or is our work team a little tooooo close!?” Stevenson captioned the video, encouraging viewers to tag friends who would dare to try breast milk from someone else. She humorously added, “It’s actually delicious!”The footage shows Stevenson, a wellness influencer and mother of three, pumping her breast milk before offering it to several people, including a staff member, her husband, and her elder son. In the video, one woman takes a sip, exclaims, “Oh my God,” and bursts into laughter. Another woman quickly follows, sipping from a different beverage after trying the breast milk.Social media users have been split on the stunt. Some have expressed admiration for the act, while others have criticized it as “cringe” or “weird.” One Instagram user posted, “Mine tasted like the milk left after eating a sweet kids cereal. I was so shocked at how good it really is.” In contrast, another user wrote, “Nope. Never.”Others weighed in on the broader topic of breast milk, with one commenter admitting, “I’ve breastfed 3 babies and have never ever tried my breast milk,” while another remarked, “This is nature, but still so wild all at once.” The debate continues to rage, with some finding humor in the idea and others unable to get past the unusual nature of the gesture.Sarah Stevenson, 32, recently welcomed her third son after a challenging pregnancy and the birth of a baby who has faced severe reflux issues. She has been transparent with her followers about the difficulties of caring for a newborn who struggles with constant discomfort.“To be completely transparent; this has been the toughest 6 weeks of my life. Having a baby who screams and vomits almost 24/7 for the past 6 weeks straight has been extremely taxing and stripped me of any joy and happiness I had prior to giving birth,” Stevenson shared on her Instagram. “I want to thank you all for giving me the space and open platform to share my journey on my IG stories, it has truly helped me so much in feeling less alone, isolated, and depressed. For those who have been in a similar experience to me, you know firsthand how dark these days are.”Despite the mixed reactions to her breast milk stunt, Stevenson remains open about her struggles and her approach to motherhood, giving her followers a behind-the-scenes look at the raw reality of parenting.","Sarah Stevenson, a wellness influencer, shared a video of herself pumping breast milk.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme. In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

“Outrageous”: Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon on Arm’s demand in legal battle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/outrageous-qualcomm-ceo-cristiano-amon-on-arms-demand-in-legal-battle/articleshow/116478073.cms,"Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon

What is the case all about

Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon has testified in a legal battle against chip designer Arm Holdings , terming Arm’s demands in licensing dispute “outrageous”. He also accused the British semiconductor and software design company of misleading Qualcomm's customers, including Samsung , by falsely claiming that a license to use Arm's technology would expire in 2025.“That was not good for Qualcomm, our customers, or frankly, for Arm,” Amon told jurors, while clarifying that the license actually extends until 2033, as per a Bloomberg report.During cross-examination, Amon affirmed that Qualcomm will honour valid licensing agreements and refuted Arm's claim that Qualcomm knowingly violated the terms of its license.The dispute centers on a licensing agreement for Arm's chip technology, which is crucial to the electronics industry. In 2021, Qualcomm acquired Nuvia that developed a custom processor but licenses the base Arm architecture.Arm contends that the licensing agreement it had with Nuvia should have been renegotiated after the acquisition and demanded that Qualcomm destroy any designs acquired in the deal. Qualcomm, however, argues that its existing license with Arm covers its use of Nuvia’s technology.Reportedly, Amon justified purchasing the company by telling Qualcomm’s board that the company can save as much as $1.4 billion per year on payments to Arm by switching away from Arm’s computing core designs to those based on work by Nuvia and its team.Amon also criticised Arm's demand for the destruction of Nuvia's technology, calling it “outrageous” and an unprecedented move in the tech industry.Qualcomm has used Nuvia’s technology and talent to push into the PC market by powering Microsoft’s Copilot+ PCs to better compete with Apple’s MacBook offerings.In an interview earlier this year, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella praised Apple for doing “a fantastic job of really innovating on the Mac.”“We're going to outperform them. We finally feel we have a very competitive product,” Nadella noted.","The dispute centers on a licensing agreement for Arm's chip technology, which is crucial to the electronics industry.

Meta fined $263 million for 6-year-old data breach that leaked 29 million Facebook accounts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-fined-263-million-for-6-year-old-data-breach-that-leaked-29-million-facebook-accounts/articleshow/116476631.cms,"Meta fined $263 million for 2018 data breach: Here's what happened

The European Union's data privacy authorities have imposed a $263 million fine on Meta, Facebook’s parent company, for a 2018 data breach that exposed millions of user accounts. The breach exploited vulnerabilities in Facebook's code, allowing hackers to steal digital keys, or access tokens, that granted control over user accounts. Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), Meta's lead privacy regulator within the EU, issued the penalty after a detailed investigation. The case underscores the EU's commitment to enforcing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), one of the world's strictest privacy laws. Meta plans to appeal the decision, maintaining that it acted swiftly and transparently to address the breach.The breach occurred in September 2018, when hackers exploited a series of bugs in Facebook’s ‘View As’ feature. This tool allowed users to see how their profiles appeared to others, but flaws in its code enabled attackers to steal access tokens. These tokens, essentially digital keys, granted attackers complete control over user accounts without needing passwords.The attack escalated through connected accounts, spreading from one Facebook friend to another. Initially, Facebook estimated that 50 million accounts were affected. However, further investigation revealed that around 29 million accounts were compromised, including 3 million in Europe.Upon discovering the breach, Facebook reported the issue to law enforcement, including the FBI, and informed data protection regulators in Europe and the United States. The company also promptly fixed the vulnerabilities in the ""View As"" feature and notified affected users.Despite these efforts, the Irish Data Protection Commission found Meta in violation of GDPR regulations. The inquiry concluded that Meta failed to adequately secure user data and allowed multiple infringements of GDPR, resulting in the $263 million fine. Alongside the financial penalty, the DPC issued formal reprimands and administrative directives to Meta.Meta, however, disputes the decision and plans to appeal. In a statement, the company highlighted its proactive response, asserting that it acted transparently and took immediate corrective measures.Under GDPR, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission serves as the lead privacy regulator for Meta, as the company’s European headquarters are in Dublin. This is not the first time Meta has faced scrutiny from the DPC. The watchdog has previously levied fines on the tech giant for data-related violations, demonstrating its active role in ensuring compliance with GDPR across the EU.The General Data Protection Regulation, implemented in 2018, grants EU citizens significant control over their personal data and imposes strict obligations on companies to protect that data. The law allows for fines of up to 4% of a company’s global revenue for serious violations.The $263 million penalty against Meta is part of the EU’s broader effort to hold tech giants accountable for safeguarding user data. The case reinforces the importance of robust data security measures and transparent practices in handling breaches.","Facebook's parent company, Meta, has been fined $263 million for a 2018 data breach.
