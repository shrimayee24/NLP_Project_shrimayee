The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes.

"World’s largest late Roman hoard of 50,000 ancient coins discovered off Sardinia near Arzachena",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/worlds-largest-late-roman-hoard-of-50000-ancient-coins-discovered-off-sardinia-near-arzachena/articleshow/127764917.cms,"Source: Biblical Archaeology Society

What the Sardinia coin find reveals about Roman money and movement



How Roman follis coins kept the empire moving



How nature protected the Sardinia coins over time



Why the Sardinia coin find stands out in Roman history







A casual swim off Sardinia turned into something remarkable. Near Arzachena, a diver spotted metal glinting faintly on the seabed. Curiosity sparked immediately. Authorities were alerted. What they found was astounding: thousands of fourth-century bronze coins, reportedly between 30,000 and 50,000 pieces, many remarkably well-preserved despite centuries underwater.The coins lay scattered on sand between the beach and underwater seagrass. Small fragments of amphorae rested nearby. Some might have come from Africa, others from Asia. This stretch of coast was a busy trade route in late Roman times, bustling with merchants, ships, and goods. For a moment, the past was visible, resting quietly under the calm, blue Mediterranean waters.“The treasure found in the waters off Arzachena represents one of the most important coin discoveries in recent years,” said Luigi La Rocca, general director of Archaeology, Fine Arts and Landscape at Italy’s Ministry of Culture. Experts say finds like this tell stories beyond collectors’ shelves. They capture moments in the economy, politics, and daily life of the Roman world.A snapshot of trade, rulers, and reforms that shaped ordinary people’s lives.It’s more than old coins. It’s a tiny, detailed window into history. The stash sits off Sardinia’s northeastern shore, near modern Arzachena. The seabed forms a shallow platform. Currents spread objects without burying them too deeply. Investigators mapped two main zones in sand, bordered by dense seagrass. That boundary is important. Plant roots hold sediment in place, while coins and ceramic fragments peek through. Amphora fragments hint at commercial movement. Some from North Africa, others from eastern provinces. Merchants apparently mixed goods from different routes on a single voyage.Most are follis, large bronze coins introduced during Diocletian’s currency reform. Early folles weighed about ten grams and had a thin silver wash. It made the base metal look respectable. Over time, silvering and weight declined as a signal of the pressures Rome faced in funding armies, bureaucracy, and public projects. Yet, face value kept everyday trade moving. By the early fourth century, folles linked people across the empire. Sailors, farmers, and merchants all used the same currency. Hoard like this helps historians track how far coins travelled and how interconnected the empire really was.Large coin groups usually tell a story. A storm might have spilled cargo. A captain might have stashed pay for the next port. Currents near Arzachena slow naturally, which could help concentrate objects. Scattering patterns suggest containers broke apart. Coins tumbled, lodged in pockets of sand, sometimes near amphora fragments. Archaeologists hope to reconstruct a voyage, its cargo, and perhaps its abrupt end.Seagrass might have saved the coins. Posidonia oceanica locks artifacts in low-oxygen sediment, slowing decay. The meadows trap particles, dampen waves, and create a quiet archive where coins and ceramics can last centuries.Even at the lower estimate, this find surpasses the Seaton Down Hoard in Britain, which held about 22,888 late Roman coins. The Sardinia discovery sets a new reference point for late Roman money in the western Mediterranean. Coins carry precise information. Icons, inscriptions, mint marks. Names of rulers. Slogans of the time. Their metal chemistry hints at water and sediment conditions. Tool marks reveal workshop practices. Matching amphora clay recipes might even link the coins to a cargo of oil or wine.","Thousands of fourth-century bronze coins, reportedly between 30,000 and 50,000 pieces.

World’s longest road tunnel takes drivers on a 20-minute journey without daylight beneath Norway’s mountains,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/worlds-longest-road-tunnel-takes-drivers-on-a-20-minute-journey-without-daylight-beneath-norways-mountains/articleshow/127533646.cms,"AI Generated

The Laerdal Tunnel: Longest road tunnel designed for drivers in Norway



How the Lærdal Tunnel’s lighting reduces driver fatigue





Advanced safety features inside the Lærdal Tunnel







Traveling through tunnels is usually just a normal part of a trip, but the Laerdal Tunnel in Norway is something special. The tunnel is 15.2 miles long and goes under a mountain range that looks like it came straight out of a movie. Drivers can go through the tunnel for up to 20 minutes without ever seeing the sun. The tunnel connects the towns of Laerdal and Aurland. It is an important way to get from Oslo in the east to Bergen in the west. Every year, thousands of people who work, visit, or move goods through the tunnel. The tunnel is not just a way to get from one place to another. People all over the world call it an engineering marvel because of its size, shape, and usefulness, which make it easy for people to get around. It shows that infrastructure can put people first, even when the ground is hard to work with.According to The Sun reports, after about five years of building, the Laerdal Tunnel opened in November 2000. It cost 1.08 billion Norwegian kroner, which is about £80 million. It goes through a mountain range with peaks that are 1,400 meters high, making it the longest road tunnel in the world. Engineers had to make sure that the structure was safe and that drivers could drive comfortably over such a long underground stretch without losing their focus or getting lost.Unlike most tunnels, Laerdal is not a boring tube. The design shows that the people who made it knew that people can get bored in long, closed spaces. To fix this, the tunnel has sections that are wider and more like caves at regular intervals. These parts give drivers a break from the view and a place to pull over.A big new feature of the Laerdal Tunnel is its innovative lighting system. The lights are warm blue and orange tones that illuminate different areas instead of relying on a long, monotonous strip of white fluorescent lights. These creatively coloured rooms make the drive less boring and visually stimulating, which helps keep drivers from getting tired, drowsy, or distracted and encourages them to stay awake and alert. Some of these rooms are spacious enough for cars to park safely and comfortably. This thoughtful design gives long-haul drivers or anyone who is tired a chance to take a short rest break, stretch, and rejuvenate before moving on. The tunnel makes the long underground passage safer, more comfortable, and remarkably unique, creating a one-of-a-kind experience for all drivers passing through.Safety has always been the most important thing in the Laerdal Tunnel. The tunnel has a modern ventilation system that makes sure the air is clean and easy to breathe the whole way through. Fifteen cameras watch traffic and accidents so that help can be sent right away if needed. If there is an accident, automated systems can quickly close the tunnel to stop other problems from happening.There are also safety points every 500 meters that include fire extinguishers, emergency phones, and other critical safety equipment. This is important because it means that drivers can get help right away if they need it. The Laerdal Tunnel is not only the longest road tunnel in the world, but it is also one of the safest. Everyone knows the Lærdal Tunnel as a tourist attraction and as a practical road. Many reviews mention how beautiful the colored tunnels are and how cool it is to drive through the mountains for 20 minutes. Those who visit the tunnel often say that they are always amazed by how large and well-constructed it is. Some even say that it feels more like an adventure than a ride.The tunnel itself is a reason for people who have never visited Norway to visit the country. It proves how much Norway is interested in new ideas, in building, and in making driving easier.","The Laerdal Tunnel in Norway is 15.2 miles long and goes under a mountain range that looks like it came straight out of a movie.

AI works behind the scenes in a lot of things, like search engines, mobile phones, office software, and online shopping. Some people are excited about this change, while others are worried about losing their jobs or becoming less important. A strong quote from Sam Altman gives clarity and hope in this situation. He says, ""AI won't take over for people."" But people who use AI will take the place of those who don't. This simple line reminds us that machines don't own the future. People who are willing to learn, change, and grow with technology, instead of running away from it, own it.At first, it might seem like Sam Altman's quote is too direct or harsh. But if we look closely, it has a good message. He is not saying that people will be useless.

People use AI when they:These tools cut down on work and save time. They help people concentrate on being creative, solving problems, and growing as people. People who learn how to use these tools wisely often find that work is easier and more productive.AI is powerful, but it cannot replicate everything that makes people unique. Creativity, emotional intelligence, moral judgement, and imagination are still uniquely human traits.A machine can give you information, but it cannot feel sorry for you. It can analyse data, but it cannot truly grasp how people feel. That is why individuals with both technical capabilities and values will always be valued.This viewpoint is supported by a quote from Sam Altman. It claims that success stems from the combination of intelligence and compassion.This quote reminds students to learn new things as well as do their regular schoolwork. Learning about technology early on can help you in many ways later on.For people who work, this is a sign to keep learning new things. Learning never stops, especially in this digital age. Even small things, like learning one new tool at a time, can have a big impact.For business owners, this means using AI to make services better, cut costs, and better serve customers.","Quote of the day by Sam Altman: “AI won’t replace humans.

Clavicular reveals how Kick’s creator incentive program powered his massive January payout,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/clavicular-reveals-how-kicks-creator-incentive-program-powered-his-massive-january-payout/articleshow/127790413.cms,"Kick streamer Clavicular revealed his January 2026 earnings, showing he made $110,674.67 on Kick. More than 90 percent came from the Kick Creator Incentive Program, not subscriptions or donations. The figures highlight why KCIP has become a major draw for high-visibility streamers seeking higher, view-based payouts.

Clavicular’s Kick dashboard reveal leaves fans stunned by KCIP payout

Katie Porter’s Temper Caught on Camera: Democrat’s FURIOUS Outburst at Staffer Resurfaces





Kick streamer Clavicular has made curiosity to clarity, proving that the Creator Incentive Program on the platform is profitable. Clavicular briefly displayed his earnings dashboard in late January during one of his live streams, and the numbers were soon on the agenda of all streamers. The only difference was not the size of the payout, but the fact that it was concentrated on only one type of income.These figures provided us with an uncommon insight into the consistency and visibility of Kick. Many creators rely on subscriptions and donations to get their money, however, this is not the case with Clavicular. The example of his case indicates that platform-sponsored incentives can transform the business model of a streamer, particularly the creators who receive a significant number of views but are not concentrated on conventional subscriber funnels.Kick paid Clavicular a total of $110,674.67 for most of January 2026. $102,774.60 of that came directly from the Kick Creator Incentive Program, which was more than 90% of his monthly payment. In comparison, chat engagement and subscriptions together brought in about $1,000, which is almost nothing.This breakdown shows why KCIP has become such a popular place for creators to go. Clavicular gets between 60,000 and 100,000 views per stream and has more than 150,000 followers.That visibility directly affects KCIP earnings, rewarding reach instead of paywalled access.The way Kick rewards people has already changed how people stream in general. Famous creators like Zach Asmongold Hoyt have shown in public that Kick payouts are better than those of other platforms. This has led more streamers to multistream or switch platforms altogether.The importance of the Clavicular is exhibited by the fact that Clavicular is the only one working with Kick. Although it has had its issues in the past such as a temporary ban and concerns about his real-life content, the monetary gain is difficult to overlook. His alleged sponsorship with Young LA contributes to his revenue, yet the amounts are unknown.Although the KCIP payouts are able to vary, the January earnings of Clavicular reveal the reason why Kick continues to attract creators who are interested in growing, being stable, and earning a lot of money.","Kick streamer Clavicular revealed his January 2026 earnings, showing he made $110,674.67 on Kick.

This partnership, confirmed this month, signifies a major shift for Apple, which previously favored in-house development. The revamped Siri, powered by Gemini, is expected with iOS 26.4, aiming for a March/April rollout.

Apple weighed options from OpenAI and Anthropic before settling on Google

Hassabis sees room for the partnership to grow





Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis isn't hiding his satisfaction over the Apple deal. In an interview with Alex Heath, Hassabis said he's proud that Gemini came out on top after Apple put multiple AI providers through a thorough evaluation. He added that Google has ideas for efficient AI models that could work well on edge devices like phones and even in robotics.The multi-year partnership, confirmed earlier this month, means Apple's foundation models will now be built on Gemini and Google's cloud technology. A joint statement from both companies said Apple found Google's AI to be the most capable option available. The models will still run on Apple devices and its Private Cloud Compute infrastructure, keeping the company's privacy commitments intact.According to Bloomberg, Apple is shelling out roughly $1 billion a year for a custom 1.2 trillion parameter Gemini model. The company evaluated offerings from Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported that OpenAI was never really in the running, while Anthropic led early discussions before pricing talks broke down.The Financial Times pegged the deal's total value at around $5 billion for Google, structured as cloud services rather than a straight licensing arrangement. The revamped Siri powered by Gemini is expected to arrive with iOS 26.4, which should hit beta in February before a wider rollout in March or April.Asked about where Google wants to place Gemini versus keeping it exclusive to its own products, Hassabis said it depends on the situation. He noted that Google still has an edge with first-party devices because it can tightly integrate models with product surfaces. But he made clear the company is keen on enterprise business and deeper collaborations with partners that bring strong ecosystems to the table.For Apple, the deal represents a notable departure from its usual playbook of building everything in-house. The company pushed back its major Siri overhaul from spring 2025 to 2026 and moved AI chief John Giannandrea away from product development. The partnership also builds on a long history between the two tech giants—Google already pays Apple billions annually to remain the default search engine on iPhones.","Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said he's proud that Gemini came out on top after Apple put multiple AI providers through a thorough evaluation.

There are moments in Wordle when you lose confidence and follow your instincts. That's how people usually wait these days. You can't take shortcuts, but you also can't rush through the puzzle. Initial presumptions may appear favourable at first, but they can also progressively impede better decisions. The letters are recognisable and nearly obvious, but the placement is more important than normal. Smart openers and ostentatious risks are not appropriate at this moment. Players who pay as much attention to what is absent as to what is present are rewarded, but it requires self-control and concentration. It makes sense if you've been staring at the grid for longer than you intended. As long as the framework aligns, the solution remains unattainable. You can maintain stability and concentrate on the word by using a few well-chosen signals.Wordle challenges players to uncover a hidden five-letter word in six attempts. After each guess, tiles change colour to show how close you are.Using this feedback to refine each new guess is the core of the game.If today’s puzzle is proving stubborn, these clues focus on structure rather than spelling. They are intended to guide rather than solve.Reviewing eliminated letters and leaning on common consonants may help reduce the remaining options and bring the solution into view.The answer to Wordle #1686 on January 30, 2026, is:Meaning: Something extremely large, bulky, or of unusual, massive size, often used for products, aircraft, or to denote superior capacityWhether you solved it on your first guess or needed a few clues, Wordle remains a fun way to sharpen your mind every day.

UK households urged to stockpile three essentials ahead of Storm Chandra power cut risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-households-urged-to-stockpile-three-essentials-ahead-of-storm-chandra-power-cut-risk/articleshow/127574703.cms,"UK households are urged to prepare torches, spare batteries and phone chargers ahead of potential power cuts/ Image: Pexels

“

Storm Chandra

will bring persistent rain, heavy at times, later Monday and overnight before steadily clearing northeastwards on Tuesday morning. 30–50mm rainfall is likely widely, with 60–80mm across some higher ground, especially south Dartmoor. Falling on saturated ground, this is likely to lead to flooding and disruption, particularly on Tuesday morning. Strong southeasterly winds are also expected.”

“Whilst accumulating snow is unlikely at low-levels, there will be a sharp increase in snow depths with elevation, with the potential for 2–5cm in places above about 300m, 5–10cm above 400m, and 10–20cm above 500m. This may impact some high-level routes, with drifting possible in rather brisk southeasterly winds. Strong, gusty winds, especially to the west of hills, may exacerbate the potential for transport disruption.”

“Storm Chandra will bring a range of hazards to the UK through Monday night and Tuesday. Initially strong winds will impact the Isles of Scilly, western Cornwall and southwest Wales which are still vulnerable after Storm Goretti, gusts of 70 to 80mph are possible here. Heavy rain is an additional hazard as it falls on saturated ground in Dorset and southern parts of Devon, Somerset and Cornwall.

As Chandra interacts with colder air further north snow becomes a hazard, with 10–20cm of snow possibly accumulating over higher ground in the Pennines, southern Scotland and the Highlands. With a complex spell of weather, it’s important people stay up to date with the forecast and any warnings in your area.”

The three items households are urged to have ready

First, a torch. British Gas recommends a battery-powered or wind-up (kinetic) torch to ensure light is available if electricity supplies are interrupted.

Second, spare batteries. Households are advised to stock up on appropriate batteries. such as AA or AAA, for torches and other essential devices.

Third, a backup charger for mobile phones. A portable battery pack with a charging cable can help people stay connected and access updates during an outage.

“You might even consider a battery-powered radio, to keep on top of local updates if you can’t use your mobile.”





The Met Office has issued a series of weather warnings covering snow, rain and wind from late Monday through Tuesday. These include a 17-hour yellow warning for rain and snow from midnight Tuesday until 5pm, an amber warning for wind in eastern Northern Ireland, and an amber warning for rain across parts of south-west England.Explaining the risk in the south of England, the Met Office said:In northern England and Scotland, snow rather than rain is the main concern. The Met Office warned:In a broader briefing on the storm, the Met Office said Storm Chandra will bring “a further spell of wet and windy conditions later Monday and into Tuesday”, with gusty winds initially affecting the Isles of Scilly, western Cornwall and south-west Wales before moving north through the Irish Sea.An amber warning for wind has been issued for eastern Northern Ireland, where gusts of 60–70mph are expected widely, with up to 75mph possible in coastal areas. Heavy rain falling on already saturated ground in south Devon, Dorset, southern Somerset and south-east Cornwall could lead to flooding, while colder air further north will turn precipitation into hill snow across northern England and Scotland.Met Office Chief Forecaster Paul Gundersen said:With the risk of power cuts rising during periods of severe weather, energy firm British Gas has urged households to make sure they have three key items readily available.British Gas added:While additional supplies such as non-perishable food and blankets can be useful, the focus of the advice is on lighting, communication and access to information during potential power disruptions as Storm Chandra moves across the UK.","UK households urged to prepare torches, spare batteries and phone chargers ahead of potential power cuts.

As preparations for Ramadan begin to gather pace, the Ministry of Commerce has announced the launch of the Ramadan sales season, a nationwide initiative designed to help consumers shop early and ease pressure during the peak festive period. The sales season will run for 54 days, starting on February 1 and continuing until March 26, 2026.The timing of the campaign has been aligned with the Islamic calendar as well, beginning on Shaban 13 and concluding on Shawwal 7. By extending the sales window well beyond the end of Ramadan and through Eid Al-Fitr , the ministry aims to reduce last-minute congestion in markets and allow households to plan their purchases in a more relaxed manner.The Ramadan sales season covers a wide range of products linked to the holy month and the subsequent Eid celebrations. This includes all Ramadan-related goods as well as Eid necessities, ensuring that consumers can access discounts across essential categories throughout the period, rather than being limited to a short festive window.Also Read: Ramadan 2026: Expected dates, fasting hours, and seasonal shifts explained To support businesses, the Ministry of Commerce has invited retail establishments and online stores to participate by applying for discount permits electronically through the official platform sales.mc.gov.sa.The ministry clarified that taking part in the Ramadan sales season will not deduct from an establishment’s annual discount balance. This means businesses can obtain, print, and display official permits without losing any of their allocated discount days for the year, making participation simpler and more flexible.Consumer transparency is a key part of the initiative. Shoppers can verify the authenticity of discounts by scanning the barcode displayed on the official permit using their mobile phone camera. Once scanned, the system provides complete information about the offer, including the type and percentage of the discount, its duration, and basic details of the establishment offering it.The ministry also confirmed that inspection teams will conduct field tours across all regions of the Kingdom throughout the sales season. These inspections are aimed at monitoring compliance, verifying the legitimacy of promotional offers, and ensuring that advertised discounts match the information approved under the official permits.","The Ramadan sales season will run for 54 days, starting on February 1 and continuing until March 26, 2026.

UAE residents outsourcing their brains to AI: Are we losing our minds?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-residents-outsourcing-their-brains-to-ai-are-we-losing-our-minds/articleshow/127776060.cms,"UAE AI Adoption: Chatbots Become Everyday Partners for Residents

How UAE Residents Are Outsourcing Their Thinking to AI Chatbots And What It Says About the Future

The psychology of outsourcing thought to AI







In the United Arab Emirates, artificial intelligence is no longer a niche technology used only by tech companies. It is becoming an integral part of how people think, shop, work, plan and even solve day-to-day problems. As AI adoption accelerates, many residents are turning to chatbots and generative AI assistants not just for simple queries, but for complex decision-making, creativity and personalised support.Reports and surveys show that AI use in the UAE is among the highest in the world, with generative AI tools integrated into work, study and personal life. A 2025 study found that nearly two-thirds of working-age adults actively use AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini or Claude in their routines , placing the UAE at the forefront of global AI adoption.One of the most striking trends is how many UAE residents now use AI assistants to guide their research, choices and day-to-day tasks. For example, a recent retail report found that 70% of UAE consumers have used AI assistants for shopping, whether for product discovery, comparison or personalised recommendations, more than double the average rate in Europe, the Middle East and Africa region.This shift reflects a broader pattern with information overload, busy lifestyles and instant expectations, consumers increasingly prefer to offload cognitive tasks to AI, letting algorithms sift through data, suggest options and even make choices they might previously have wrestled with themselves.In essence, many users are beginning to see chatbots not just as tools for answers but as thinking partners that can help them organise trips, manage errands, generate ideas or draft content, effectively outsourcing parts of their cognitive load to AI systems.The influence of AI extends well beyond shopping. Microsoft-backed reports have highlighted that the UAE workforce has one of the highest AI adoption rates globally, with nearly 60% of workers regularly using AI tools like Copilot, ChatGPT and others in professional tasks such as drafting emails, preparing reports, analysing data and even automating routine responsibilities.Likewise, LinkedIn data shows that 80% of UAE professionals are using AI tools regularly, up sharply from the previous year, often treating AI as a sort of second job assistant that enhances productivity and extends creative capabilities. This widespread integration has turned AI chatbots into more than mere utilities. For many, they are cognitive extensions that help process information, generate ideas and complete complex tasks faster than humans alone could.AI chatbots have also found a place in public life and government services across the UAE. Platforms like Rammas, an AI assistant from Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, have answered millions of resident queries, helping people manage their utility accounts, understand bills and navigate service issues.Similarly, industry-specific chatbots such as mortgage chat assistants launched during Dubai AI Week, are helping residents make significant financial decisions by comparing real-time mortgage options and documentation requirements through conversational interfaces. These tools showcase how chatbots are transitioning from ad-hoc helpers to core components of a smart, digital lifestyle where technical expertise, bureaucratic navigation and personal decision-making can all be mediated by AI.The UAE’s national AI strategy and initiatives like ChatGPT Plus access for residents, though not fully free yet but part of broader talks under the Stargate UAE initiative, reflect government ambitions to embed AI more deeply in everyday life. These efforts aim to empower individuals and businesses alike with advanced AI tools as part of the country’s vision to become a global AI hub by 2031.By expanding access and literacy around AI, the policy push encourages residents to incorporate chatbots not just for simple queries but as trusted aides in research, planning, education and even creative work.While residents are enthusiastic about AI’s convenience, using bots to cut through online noise, get fast insights and automate routine tasks, there are also questions about trust and limitations. For example, surveys show that while many UAE consumers enjoy interacting with AI for basic support, a majority still prefer human contact for complex or sensitive issues such as customer disputes or trouble-shooting technical problems.This trust gap underscores a central tension in the AI adoption story: people like the speed and accessibility of chatbots but often hesitate to fully delegate important decisions or nuanced problem-solving to machines.Beyond practical tasks, research from behavioural studies suggests that heavy reliance on AI chatbots can shape how people approach decisions, relationships and social interaction. Longer and more intense AI use has been correlated with increased feelings of dependence and in some cases, reduced social engagement, highlighting psychological nuances in human-AI relationships that go well beyond utility.Though these findings are global and not UAE-specific, they point to broader implications of a society where AI is deeply woven into daily life, especially in a place like the UAE, where adoption rates are among the highest in the world. Outsourcing thinking to AI is not just about convenience, it suggests a shift in cognitive culture. Residents increasingly expect AI to anticipate their needs, synthesise vast amounts of information and help them make choices quickly and confidently.In workplaces, homes and government services, chatbots are becoming collaborators in thought processes rather than mere assistants.

Dubai new rules for parking shades: What residents must know before installing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-new-rules-for-parking-shades-what-residents-must-know-before-installing/articleshow/127778547.cms,"Dubai RTA Issues New Rules for Residential Parking Shades / Image: file

Dubai RTA’s new rule

Only the owner of the villa or a legally authorized representative can submit the request through the RTA website or ""Dubai Drive"" app.



You must provide a site plan showing the exact location. The shade cannot interfere with utility lines (DEWA), telecommunications, or existing trees.



The RTA strictly forbids the use of ""makeshift"" materials. Forget about using old fabric or wooden planks; the structure must be made of high-quality, weather-resistant materials that match the architectural aesthetic of the neighborhood.

Limits you need to know





As the Dubai summer approaches, every resident knows the struggle of entering a car that has been sitting in 45-degree heat. While installing a parking shade seems like a simple DIY project or a quick call to a contractor, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has issued a firm reminder that the streets and pavements outside your villa are public property.To maintain the organized beauty of Dubai’s residential communities and ensure that emergency vehicles aren't blocked, the RTA has streamlined the rules for who can build these structures and exactly how they must look.Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has rolled out a formal permit system that allows residents to install parking shade structures in residential neighbourhoods, with conditions. This move comes after listening to community feedback, especially as summer heat rises and cars parked in direct sun become a daily concern for homeowners.The new “Parking Shade Installation Permit” applies only to designated and properly reserved parking spaces in residential areas, meaning you can’t just erect shades anywhere on the street. Permits are applied for through the RTA website and processed via approved contractors.This isn’t just a token gesture, it’s a regulated system designed to be safe, orderly, and visually consistent across Dubai’s neighbourhoods. According to the RTA:The RTA is very specific about where these shades can go to prevent them from becoming a hazard.One of the most critical rules is the ""Pedestrian Path"" requirement. You must ensure that the shade does not obstruct the sidewalk; a minimum clearance must be left so that people, including those in wheelchairs or with strollers, can pass through safely.Furthermore, the height of the shade must be sufficient to allow standard SUVs and service vehicles to park underneath without clipping the roof, but it must not be so high that it blocks the line of sight for drivers turning at nearby corners.For the average resident, following these rules isn't just about avoiding a fine, though those can be steep. It’s about ""Common Impact"", ensuring that your convenience doesn't become your neighbor's headache. The RTA conducts regular inspection tours through residential zones to spot unauthorized or dilapidated shades.If a shade is found to be rusty, torn, or built without a permit, the owner will receive a notice to rectify the situation or face removal of the structure at their own expense. By sticking to the RTA guidelines, you ensure your car stays cool, your property value stays up, and your neighborhood remains one of the most organized in the world.","Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has rolled out a formal permit system that allows residents to install parking shade structures in residential neighbourhoods.

China’s ‘singing desert’ shocks visitors as sand dunes begin to hum and boom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/chinas-singing-desert-shocks-visitors-as-sand-dunes-begin-to-hum-and-boom/articleshow/127798972.cms,"Why do dunes sing in China desert



Why are these singing dunes important



Where can you find these singing deserts



What to do in these singing deserts



Are there any other singing deserts







Deserts are usually described as silent places, which is why the sound catches people off guard. In parts of China, visitors have reported dunes that hum, boom, or whistle when wind passes over them or when someone slides down their slopes. Over the past decade, these “singing dunes” have drawn renewed attention, partly because of tourism and partly because researchers have made progress explaining how sand, air, and landscape work together to produce sound.What matters here is how rare singing dunes are. Most deserts never do this. Even neighbouring dunes can remain silent while one ridge seems to respond like an instrument. That selectiveness is what keeps scientists interested and travellers curious, especially along China’s historic desert routes.As per a study titled “ Progress on research and mitigation of wind-blown sand risk in Dunhuang Singing Sand Mountain and Crescent Spring Scenic area, China ”, singing dunes are made up of grains sliding past one another. When that happens, they vibrate, and the dune helps amplify the low-frequency waves. These grains are unusually uniform in size and smoothness. This allows them to slide together in coordinated layers instead of colliding randomly. When movement happens evenly across a slope, vibration becomes possible. With the help of steady airflow that pushes grains into synchronised motion, these sand grains seem to sing.Singing dunes are more than a curiosity. They offer insight into how granular materials behave under stress, something that matters far beyond deserts. Understanding how sand grains synchronise informs research across fields ranging from geology to industrial material handling.Singing dunes are scattered across arid regions rather than concentrated in one place. But the place that attracts most of the tourists in China is Duahuang. The dunes vary widely in height and shape and are around 500m. The climate there is dry, vegetation is sparse, and winds arrive with enough consistency to move sand without saturating it.Such singing deserts are very popular among tourists, and activities like sandboarding or guided walks are often done. Observation platforms are also available, which allow people to listen without disturbing sensitive areas. Night visits are especially popular, since cooler air and reduced background noise allow sound to travel farther.People have become cautious regarding excessive foot traffic and vehicles, as these can disrupt the grain structure. Once that balance is lost, the dune may fall silent.As cited in EarthDate, apart from these deserts that sing in China, there are around three dozen places on Earth where dunes sing. They can be found in Nevada, Chile, Morocco and even India. You can visit these places and experience this wonder yourself.","Singing dunes are made up of grains sliding past one another.

The ability to switch platforms indicates that major streamers are usually flexible in terms of where they stream, ensuring that they can still reach their followers even when faced with setbacks. Fans reacted positively to the announcement.Ultimately, HasanAbi’s latest suspension has not hindered his plans for content. By switching his next live stream to YouTube, he has ensured that his fans are not affected while he waits for his Twitch access to be restored.

Price, and access





The UAE’s media landscape has officially entered a new era with the launch of Dubai Plus, a homegrown streaming platform designed specifically for Emirati and Arab audiences. Unveiled by Dubai Media, this digital destination aims to bridge the gap between traditional TV and modern on-demand viewing.Unlike global giants that cater to a universal audience, Dubai Plus is laser-focused on local identity. It serves as a digital archive and a fresh stage for Emirati talent, ensuring that the rich heritage, humor, and drama of the UAE are accessible to anyone with an internet connection, anywhere in the world.Dubai+ is a new digital media platform launched by the UAE Media Office and approved by His Highness Sheikh Ahmed bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, aiming to reflect the evolving digital media landscape and support the emirate’s creative economy.

The catalogue includes:New content is said to be added regularly for example, every Thursday, which keeps the library fresh and engaging for frequent visitors.While the focus is on a family audience and Arab cultural content, the inclusion of international shows gives Dubai+ broader appeal across diverse viewer groups.The short answer is no, but it isn't trying to.

"UAE banks introduce digital verification, phase out handwritten signatures",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-banks-introduce-digital-verification-phase-out-handwritten-signatures/articleshow/127767491.cms,"Your phone is now your signature as UAE banks go paperless

UAE bank's new digital leap

Biometrics and in-app approvals

What does this mean for customers?

Faster, paperless banking - no more branch visits for approvals.



More secure authentication - moving beyond SMS codes to identity tied directly to the user and device.



Greater reliance on mobile banking apps - your phone becomes the hub of authorisation and identity.



Preparation required - update banking apps, enable push notifications, and activate biometric login features to avoid disruptions.







For decades, a handwritten signature was the gold standard of trust in banking, but in the UAE, the ink is finally running dry. Banks across the country have begun a coordinated phase-out of traditional signatures for retail and corporate transactions.This shift means that the days of meticulously signing checkbooks or loan applications with a pen are being replaced by a ""digital handshake.""Leading financial institutions, in alignment with the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE), are moving toward a 100% paperless verification model. This transition isn't just about modernizing, it’s about eliminating the human error and forgery risks that have long plagued handwritten verifications.Another landmark change is the elimination of SMS-based one-time passwords (OTPs), a familiar security tool used for years to approve online transactions. UAE banks officially stopped sending OTP codes by SMS for online card payments from January 6, 2026, and all banks are required to phase out both SMS and email OTPs by March 2026 at the latest, under Central Bank directives.Instead of relying on codes sent through carrier networks, which are vulnerable to fraud tactics like SIM swapping and interception, customers must now authorise transactions directly through their bank’s mobile app.This shift is designed to tighten cybersecurity, speed up approvals, and eliminate the weakest link in digital banking authentication.Banks have been notifying customers in advance, urging them to update apps, enable notifications, and set up in-app authentication features (including biometrics) to ensure a seamless experience. Without app-based verification enabled, online payments could be declined once SMS codes are turned off.The replacement for SMS OTPs isn’t just another password or code, it’s in-app approvals backed by biometrics. Most UAE banks now let customers confirm transactions right inside their mobile banking app with fingerprint scans, facial recognition, or secure app-based PINs.This method is more secure because it operates entirely within the app’s encrypted environment, rather than over open telecom networks. It also simplifies the user experience: instead of reading a text message and typing a code, users receive a prompt in the app and confirm the payment with a tap and biometric check.Experts note that while this is a big security upgrade, it brings new risks that banks and customers must address, such as malware, phishing attempts targeting banking apps, and ensuring devices remain secure. Nevertheless, the shift represents global best practices in digital security and aligns the UAE with advanced authentication trends worldwide.For everyday UAE residents, these changes mean:Beyond banking, this shift is part of the UAE’s broader push toward a fully digital financial ecosystem, including initiatives like digital KYC platforms and pilot projects for biometric payments using facial and palm recognition. These moves help position the UAE as a global leader in secure, innovative financial technology.In short, the era of ink signatures and SMS passwords is ending. In its place is a digital-first, biometric-enabled banking experience that promises stronger protection and smoother daily interactions for everyone who banks in the UAE.","Banks across the country have begun a coordinated phase-out of traditional signatures for retail and corporate transactions.

(RTA) has advised drivers to slow down, ensure headlights and wipers are working, and allow extra travel time during rain and wind. With wind gusts predicted to pick up at times and occasional blowing dust expected, visibility could drop suddenly, especially on highways and open stretches.

Sea conditions are forecast to be moderate to rough in the Arabian Gulf and Oman Sea, potentially disrupting small boats and beach activities.

What to expect next





While the UAE is known for its golden sun, residents woke up to a very different scene this Monday morning. A powerful low-pressure system has officially moved in, bringing with it a rare and dramatic display of nature: hail.As dawn broke, social media was flooded with videos from Al Rams and northern areas of Ras Al Khaimah, showing streets covered in small hailstones. This icy start wasn't just limited to the north; overnight rainfall has been soaking parts of Fujairah and Al Ain, turning the desert landscape into a cool, misty escape. For many, it’s a much-needed relief, but for those on the morning commute, it’s a signal to slow down and stay alert.According to the National Center of Meteorology (NCM), the current weather ""unsettledness"" is caused by an extension of a surface low-pressure system from the Red Sea, paired with an upper-air low. In simpler terms: cold air from the north is meeting moisture, creating perfect conditions for rain and hail.The temperature drop is noticeable across the board:As the unsettled weather continues, authorities are urging motorists and residents to take precautions:These advisories come amid a broader trend of weather system impacts on travel, daily life and coastal activities, with authorities emphasising caution near flood-prone or exposed areas.If you’re wondering whether to keep your umbrella handy, the answer is yes, but only for a little longer. The NCM predicts that while the rain may persist in northern and eastern regions throughout the day, the system will gradually weaken.However, a new challenge awaits early-morning commuters: fog. As the humidity rises and the winds calm down, thick mist is expected to blanket internal and coastal areas on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. Visibility could drop significantly, so if you have an early flight or a long drive, plan for extra time.","Temperatures are hovering between a crisp 12°C and 18°C, with recent lows previously hitting near-freezing points.

A travel reset worth the road trip from UAE to Khasab







If you are in the UAE and craving a break from the city buzz but don't want to hop on a long flight, there is a serene, breathtaking corner of the Arabian Peninsula that is quietly becoming one of the Middle East ’s most rewarding nature getaways: Khasab in Oman. Often called the “Norway of Arabia”, this fjord-lined coastal town on the Musandam Peninsula delivers dramatic scenery, calm turquoise waters, playful marine life and a slower pace that feels like another world entirely, all just a short road trip away.Khasab sits on the Musandam Peninsula, an Omani exclave separated from the rest of Oman by the UAE. It is roughly a 2.5-hour drive from Dubai but once you cross the border, the striking landscape of steep mountains, fjord-like inlets and clear sea instantly wipes away any sense of city stress. The drive itself sets the tone, winding along coastal cliffs that plunge into deep, brilliant blue waters. There is little traffic and plenty of photo stops and by the time you reach Khasab, the transition from urban rush to nature’s calm is complete.What really sets Khasab apart is its dramatic fjords. These towering rock formations rising directly from glassy sea create a landscape that feels more like Scandinavia than the Arabian Peninsula. Taking a traditional Omani dhow cruise through these waterways is one of the quintessential ways to experience the region, with gentle breezes, calm seas and panoramic viewpoints in every direction.On these dhow boats you will often spot dolphins swimming alongside, a crowd-delighting feature of many cruises, especially in calmer morning waters.Local tour companies emphasise the high chances of dolphin sightings and immersive experiences that include swimming and snorkelling in sheltered coves.One of Khasab’s most magical moments is how effortlessly dolphins appear, gliding alongside boats as if they have always belonged there. Traditional dhow cruises also drift past isolated fishing villages accessible only by water, where life unfolds slowly and simply, far removed from the gloss and rush of city living.The turquoise waters around Musandam are not just beautiful; they are invitingly calm, making snorkelling and even beginner-friendly aquatic adventures very accessible. The sheltered fjords, like Khor Shem, offer crystal-clear conditions to float above vibrant coral and fish life, while kayaks let you explore hidden coves at your own pace.Meanwhile, traditional fishing villages dot the coastline, where life moves at its own rhythm. Some are accessible only by boat, offering a rare glimpse into coastal Omani culture untouched by the tourist trappings seen elsewhere.For travellers who want to linger, overnight dhow cruises offer an even richer perspective. These trips combine dolphin watching, kayaking, fishing and guided hikes and often include multi-course meals and gentle evenings anchored under starry skies. The experience lets visitors feel fully immersed in Musandam’s natural majesty — not just passing through it.With border crossings streamlined and travel buzz returning in early 2026, Khasab has emerged as a practical, scenic escape for UAE motorists and weekend adventurers. It is the kind of landscape that is easy to contactless book through tour operators that run day cruises and overnight stays, yet still rewarding for independent travellers who drive themselves across the border.Importantly, safety and tourism infrastructure, from boats to guides, means that even first-time visitors can enjoy this rugged beauty without stress. However, it is not just the dramatic fjords and dolphins. The peaceful natural environment and slower pace of life are big draws for anyone feeling the strain of urban living.Here’s how travellers are enhancing their Khasab trips -Khasab is not just another scenic destination, it is becoming a symbol of accessible adventure for Gulf residents. Just a few hours from the UAE’s glitzy cities, this calm and dramatic corner of Oman delivers fjord landscapes, wildlife encounters and a sense of peace that’s rare and memorable. Whether you are planning a weekend reset, a family outing or a deeper tropical exploration, Khasab brings nature and a touch of magic right to your doorstep.For UAE residents without a visa hassle, remember that Oman often allows UAE residents a visa-free entry if your residency card is valid, making spontaneous Khasab road trips even easier.","Khasab sits on the Musandam Peninsula, an Omani exclave separated from the rest of Oman by the UAE.

What UAE residents need to know



Unsettled winters in UAE: A growing pattern?



Safety tips for UAE residents



Slow down and allow extra braking distance in rain or mist.

Use headlights and fog lights appropriately.

Stay updated on road advisories from local authorities.

Monitor air quality if winds kick up dust, especially for children and the elderly.

Postpone strenuous outdoor events if winds become gusty.

Check sea condition reports before sailing or swimming, rougher waters are possible.

Avoid small craft outings during peak wind gusts.

Follow updates from the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) and official weather channels to get the latest advisories as conditions evolve.

Bottom line





The United Arab Emirates is gearing up for a spell of unsettled winter weather that is expected to bring clouds, light rain , gusty winds and even blowing dust over the coming days, a marked shift from the typically dry winter skies residents are used to. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) says a low-pressure system moving across the region is behind the unstable conditions forecast through much of the week.Weather conditions across the UAE today will be partly cloudy to cloudy at times, particularly over coastal, northern and eastern regions, with a chance of rainfall in some areas. Winds are expected to be light to moderate, but may strengthen at intervals, stirring up dust in open areas and briefly reducing visibility.Adding to the wintry feel, the lowest temperature in the country this morning dropped to 5.8°C, recorded at Jais Mountain in Ras Al Khaimah at 4am, underscoring the cooler conditions gripping the northern mountainous areas as the UAE experiences its winter peak.This change in weather comes amid an overall pattern of winter variability, with cooler temperatures in the mountains and partly cloudy skies near the coast.Daytime highs will still be mild, in the mid-20s Celsius but residents should prepare for intermittent rain, dropping temperatures, humidity overnight and dust-raising winds.According to the latest weather outlook from the NCM -Unsettled weather can affect daily routines, especially travel. Light rain or mist in the mornings may lead to slippery roads and reduced visibility for motorists, and gusty winds could impact driving conditions in exposed areas. Drivers should stay alert and adjust speeds accordingly. Recent traffic safety guides note that rainy or unstable conditions can lead to longer braking distances and recommend extra caution behind the wheel, particularly in reduced visibility or wet roads.Dust-raising winds and sudden cloud build-ups can disrupt outdoor plans, from sporting events to picnics. Although daytime temperatures remain pleasant for winter, blown dust can cause air quality dips and eye or respiratory irritation, especially for sensitive individuals such as children and those with asthma.For marine enthusiasts and sailors, the forecast suggests a need for caution. Rougher seas in the Arabian Gulf could make conditions choppy for small boats and swimmers. Coastal communities and marinas should monitor updates from the NCM before heading out on the water.Unusual bouts of winter rain and unstable weather are not unprecedented in the UAE. Historical data show the country has seen dynamic winter patterns caused by low-pressure systems and shifting wind currents, leading to intermittent rainfall, dust storms and cloudy spells. A February 2025 report noted similar patterns of wind, dust and rain due to low-pressure systems and Shamal winds.In fact, the UAE occasionally records rare weather events — such as heavy rainfall and low temperatures high in the mountains — that remind residents that winter in the Gulf can be more variable than assumed.In light of the unsettled forecast, here are some practical tips UAE residents should consider:As the UAE’s winter unfolds, residents should be prepared for a mix of cooler temperatures, intermittent rain and changing wind patterns before clearer skies return later in the week. While these conditions may not disrupt life dramatically, they highlight how quickly weather, even in an otherwise arid region, can shift with atmospheric systems passing through.Whether you are planning a beach day, a road trip, or simply a morning commute, staying ahead of the forecast and adjusting plans accordingly will help ensure safety and comfort during this unsettled weather period.","The lowest temperature in the country this morning dropped to 5.8°C, recorded at Jais Mountain in Ras Al Khaimah at 4:00 UAE Local Time.

Samuel was sent this picture as claimed proof of delivery, though he pointed out the phone should have been signed for (Kennedy News and Media)





A delivery driver has been removed after home security footage appeared to show him faking the delivery of a £1,200 iPhone and driving away with the parcel instead.Samuel Taylor, 20, from Rochdale, ordered a £1,264 iPhone 17 Pro Max through Giffgaff, with delivery handled by DPD. On 19 January, Taylor received a photo notification claiming the parcel had been posted through his letterbox. When he returned home from work, the phone was nowhere to be found. His father confirmed no delivery had taken place.Footage from the family’s security camera showed a courier pulling up outside the house, selecting a parcel from his van and approaching the front door. Moments later, the driver appeared to walk back to the vehicle still holding the same package before driving off.“I was shocked,” Taylor said. “When I got home my dad said it wasn’t actually there. We checked the cameras and saw what happened. I was just really annoyed and I feel robbed.”Taylor contacted DPD to complain but said he was initially told the phone had been delivered and advised to raise the issue with Giffgaff. Instead, he reported the incident to Greater Manchester Police and posted the footage on social media in an effort to force the company to respond.“Since DPD are not interested in their driver not delivering my £1,200 iPhone I thought I’d shame them on here,” he wrote.Reviewing the footage later, Taylor said it became clear the driver appeared unaware he was being recorded, ruling out the possibility of an administrative mix-up or a delayed return to the depot.“I don’t think he noticed the cameras,” Taylor said. “I thought it might’ve gone back to the warehouse, but we got in touch with DPD and they said it hadn’t been signed back in.DPD later confirmed that the driver had been “removed from the business” following an internal investigation. A spokesperson said: “We have carried out a thorough investigation and can confirm that the driver has been removed from the business. We have a zero-tolerance approach to incidents such as this and will always take firm action. We apologise whole-heartedly to Mr Taylor and have informed Giffgaff.”Giffgaff said the proof of delivery did not meet its standards and confirmed Taylor’s deposit had been refunded while the case is reviewed. “We’re sorry to hear that Samuel did not receive his new iPhone as intended,” a spokesperson said.Taylor said he still has not received the phone and no longer trusts the courier. “With something that expensive it has to be signed for anyway,” he said. “I just want the phone I paid for.”","Samuel Taylor, 20, from Rochdale, ordered a £1,264 iPhone 17 Pro Max through Giffgaff, with delivery handled by DPD.

Why hundreds of bald eagles are flocking to northern British Columbia’s frozen mountains during winter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/why-hundreds-of-bald-eagles-are-flocking-to-northern-british-columbias-frozen-mountains-during-winter/articleshow/126672217.cms,"Source: X

Why British Columbia’s winter landscapes draw bald eagles together



Bald eagles and rare winter group behaviour



What winter eagle gatherings reveal to scientists







In the frozen mountains of northern British Columbia, there was the unusual occurrence of a rare incident in the wildlife scene where the bald eagles were gathered in their hundreds in one spot, and in the middle of winter. Against the background of mountains laden with snow and the icy river valley, the sight was quite outstanding and unusual. For bald eagles, which stand out in their status as symbols of freedom, power, and dominance in nature, it was highly unusual for them to congregate in such huge numbers because they were predominantly lone animals and territorial in their behaviour patterns. The severity of the weather seemed to have had a huge effect on the eagles, as only limited spaces were available and where their feeds were still accessible, forcing unprecedented gatherings that stunned researchers and local communities alike. Such rare congregations offer scientists valuable insight into how climate stress reshapes wildlife behaviour and survival strategies.The northern area of British Columbia is important to the wintering survival of bald eagles. Though much of this area will freeze, there will always be fast-moving rivers that are partially open, providing the eagles with readily available fish. Rivers that support salmon are usually connected, forming pathways to life-sustaining riverways.As winter approaches and the temperature cools, bald eagles from an increasingly vast area will migrate to these feeding grounds, and many will be seen in one small area.The harsh environment imposed by winter causes a shift in bald eagles' normal habits. The immobility brought by snow, the uninhabitability of lakes due to ice, and the shorter daylight hours make energy conservation essential. The habit of securing territories disappears, with eagles seeking locations close to food sources. The movement of prey through the snow-covered environment is predictable, helping the eagles modify their hunting patterns. What seems like a rare concentration of birds is, in actual fact, a decision based on survival that is influenced by the environment.In areas outside breeding colonies or feeding grounds, however, bald eagles tend to be alone. Adults do not compete with each other, particularly around feeding areas. To witness so many of them assemble at one place is a clear indication that their social norms have been temporarily overlooked. Experts say that it is possible only in areas where food is plentiful and accessible. In such areas, even though competition may be a disadvantage, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to observe their flexibility in handling their socialisation.The group behaviours exhibited during winter are very advantageous in several ways. The eagles can view each other in search of food, thus saving time looking for it in the frozen land. Additionally, the dominant eagles will either jump over the ice or find a source of food first as an indirect means of providing for the rest of the group members. The younger and weaker eagles are able to get protection by staying in a group, thus minimising the chances of starvation.Large winter gatherings offer a unique opportunity to study bald eagles under environmental stress. Scientists are able to estimate population size, age structure, feeding patterns, and social tolerance. It helps them to get an idea about the resiliency of the species towards extreme weather and habitat pressure. This kind of data is very crucial in view of changing climatic cycles that disturb food availability and migration behaviour in an ecosystem.The sight of hundreds of eagles in one place often plays the role of a sign of ecological vigour: healthy fish populations, undisrupted waterways, and preserved forest habitats. These aggregations are the natural barometers by which environmental health is spotlighted, emphasising those areas where ecosystems are healthy and working. Such observations also guide conservation planning, policy decisions, habitat restoration priorities, and long-term monitoring strategies across regions facing climate variability.","The sight of hundreds of bald eagles in one place is a sign of ecological vigour.

Ask Dhirendra: 'How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/mutual-funds/ask-dhirendra-how-do-i-decide-how-much-to-save-and-invest-when-my-income-is-just-about-enough/articleshow/126072787.cms,"The problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

If you have any queries for Dhirendra Kumar you can drop us an email at: toi.business@timesinternet.in

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.
