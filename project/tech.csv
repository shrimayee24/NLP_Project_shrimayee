In war-hit Ukraine , Indian innovators lend a hand to those who have lost armsIn war-hit Ukraine, Indian innovators lend a hand to those who have lost armsLVIV: Yevhen Pramonov, a member of a Ukrainian special forces battalion, lost his legs while clearing mines in Donetsk region last Dec. Working non-stop for 24 days at the time, he had stepped on a Russian mine, triggering an explosion that left him critically injured.Evacuated amid heavy gunfire, he survived thanks to first aid and, later, the expertise of the Superhumans Centre in Lviv. The centre, launched after the full-scale Russian invasion, has become alifeline for soldiers and civilians alike. Specialising in prosthetics , mental health support, reconstructive surgery, and rehabilitation, it has treated more than 625 people and provided 850 prosthetic limbs.But its success would have been difficult without Aether Biomedical, a company founded by two Indian innovators which has provided advanced bionic arms for soldiers. So far, Aether Biomedical has supplied 70 bionic arms to amputees at the centre.Aether Biomedical is a Polish company founded by Dhruv Agrawal and Faith Jiwakhan , both from Vardhman Mahavir Medical College, New Delhi. Their journey into prosthetic innovation began when they met a man born without a limb and lacking access to functional prosthetics.Determined to make a difference, they created the prototype for a bionic hand, ‘Zeus’, in a small room during their first year of medical school. The company focuses on developing advanced, multifunctional prosthetic hands activated by the user’s muscle signals.Dhruv explains: “Our prosthetics use electrodes connected to the user’s muscles to transmit signals to an algorithm, which then converts the signals into precise movements.” The prosthetics are 3D printed, remotely configurable, and locally repairable — a precious feature for Ukrainians who require maintenance in a war-torn country. Agrawal notes that with the conflict intensifying, there is “a pressing need for prosthetics as thousands have been forced to undergo amputations”.Dhruv adds: “Usually, bionic hands are weak, break easily, and take forever to repair. Our arm is the strongest in the world. It has a gripping capacity of 35kg, damage-resistant fingers designed to withstand the impact of daily life, and it can be repaired locally rather than being sent back to the manufacturer.”According to Dr Jiwakhan, the arm uses web-based software to make remote adjustments: “We have developed a digital platform for the ‘Zeus’ hand that connects clinicians and patients through a cloudbased mobile app. Clinicians can remotely configure the prosthetic, monitor device usage and make real-time adjustments. This ensures patients receive end-to-end support throughout their journey.”“I was bleeding heavily after the blast,” Yevhen recalls. “When I woke up in hospital, I knew my life had changed, but Ialso knew I wanted to keep serving my country.” Yevhen, now, after receiving bionic limbs, plans to return to the armed forces to deliver lectures at a military academy.Superhumans Centre offers prosthetic limbs free of charge, and is funded by international organisations. A mechanical knee prosthesis can range from euro 18,000 to 20,000, while a below-the-knee prosthesis costs about euro 9,000. More advanced myoelectric hands, like ‘Zeus’, cost between euro 15,000 and 50,000.","Yevhen Pramonov, a Ukrainian special forces soldier, lost his legs while clearing mines in Donetsk region last Dec.

Gilded Youth: An Intimate History of Growing Up in the

Royal Family

OK!

Kate Middleton , the Princess of Wales, has become known not only for her grace in public but also for her remarkably effective parenting style. As Prince George , Princess Charlotte , and Prince Louis grow older and attend more public events, royal watchers have noted their impeccable behavior.However, when things do go awry, Kate uses a unique method to keep her children disciplined, often employing a simple but effective phrase:In his book, royal expert Tom Quinn shed light on how the princess manages moments of mischief, such as when Prince Louis made headlines during the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee.During the event, Louis was seen sticking his tongue out at his mother, but rather than reacting harshly, Kate calmly used her signature phrase. According to Quinn, while seemingly harmless, these four words carry significant weight in the royal household. The children, understanding the cue, quickly fall back in line.Former staffers have praised Kate’s calm demeanour, noting that she prefers to let her children enjoy being kids and doesn’t overly stress about minor misbehavior. A source toldthat Kate ""doesn’t worry too much"" about her children’s behaviour and ""loves seeing them being kids."" Prince Louis, in particular, is described as an energetic child who occasionally struggles to contain his excitement during public engagements. However, his cheeky antics have often been met with humor by his parents, who even acknowledged them in a light-hearted thank-you note after the Jubilee.In contrast to more traditional approaches, the Prince and Princess of Wales prioritize open dialogue and a calm atmosphere at home. When one of their children experiences strong emotions or acts out, the royal couple opts for a ""sofa chat"" rather than isolating the child. This approach allows the children to process their feelings with guidance, rather than leaving them to manage their emotions alone. Notably, the couple adheres to a strict ""no shouting"" policy, ensuring a calm and nurturing environment even when discipline is necessary.William and Kate’s modern parenting methods, which blend discipline with empathy, continue to draw praise from experts and royal fans alike, reinforcing their image as dedicated and thoughtful parents.","Kate Middleton's signature phrase is: ""let's take a break"" royal expert Tom Quinn shed light on how the princess manages moments of mischief.

A Florida man took an unusual approach to survival as Hurricane Helene ’s storm surge turned his home into a waterlogged disaster zone. Matt Heller, from Tampa , was caught on camera paddling through his flooded living room in a kayak meant for emergencies, according to the New York Post .Heller documented the moment the waters began flooding his home in a TikTok video that quickly went viral.The storm surge from Hurricane Helene ""came out of nowhere,"" rapidly rising to 4 feet inside his house.“The kayak was my escape plan in case stuff got too hairy,” Heller told CNN. “I didn’t think I was gonna need it in my living room.”“All of a sudden the storm just kind of came in and [the waters] been rising and rising,” he said. “Within probably an hour and a half it went up about four feet from nothing.”Heller's home still had power as he paddled through the rising waters, but eventually, he was forced to rely on candlelight as electricity failed.As Heller paddled through his living room, he said, “This is definitely the biggest flood we’ve ever had.”Tampa Bay saw record-breaking storm surges. Some areas witnessed water levels as high as 7 feet, with officials warning residents that surges between 5 and 8 feet were possible. Tampa General Hospital, located on Davis Islands, installed a 15-foot water- barrier to battle the rising floodwaters.According to the US National Hurricane Center , Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida’s Big Bend area as a Category 4 storm late Thursday. The storm has left millions without power and claimed at least three lives. Helene was later downgraded to a Category 2 storm as it crossed into Georgia, causing extensive damage to everything in it's path.","Matt Heller, from Tampa, Florida, was caught on camera paddling through his flooded living room in a kayak meant for emergencies.

The Ban and Community Reaction

Implications for the Community

The WordPress community is currently facing a significant controversy involving WordPress founder and Automattic CEO, Matt Mullenweg , and WP Engine , a hosting service for WordPress-based websites. WordPress, an open-source technology powering around 40% of websites, offers flexibility in hosting, with users either managing their own setup or choosing providers like Automattic or WP Engine.In September, Mullenweg criticised WP Engine, describing it as a ""cancer to WordPress"" in a blog post. He accused the company of disabling users’ ability to track post revisions, arguing this compromises user data, and claimed it was a cost-saving measure by WP Engine. Additionally, Mullenweg alleged that WP Engine’s use of the ""WP"" brand misleads users into believing it’s officially associated with WordPress and criticised its investor, Silver Lake, for insufficient contributions to the open-source project.WP Engine responded with a cease-and-desist letter demanding a retraction, asserting that its use of the WordPress trademark was protected under fair use. WP Engine alleged that Mullenweg threatened severe action unless they paid for a WordPress trademark licence. Automattic countered with its own cease-and-desist, claiming WP Engine had breached trademark usage rules.The WordPress Foundation updated its trademark policy, explicitly criticising WP Engine’s branding as misleading. It highlighted that while ""WP"" isn’t trademark-protected, WP Engine's actions caused confusion, and despite generating significant revenue, WP Engine had not donated to the WordPress Foundation.Following this, Mullenweg banned WP Engine from accessing WordPress.org resources, impacting many websites that relied on WP Engine for plugin and theme updates, leaving them vulnerable to security issues. The move sparked widespread criticism within the WordPress community.WP Engine accused Mullenweg of abusing his influence over WordPress to disrupt their operations, arguing this action affected not just WP Engine but also its customers, plugin developers, and the wider open-source community.Mullenweg clarified that the dispute was strictly about trademarks, stating that Automattic had tried negotiating a licence with WP Engine, which had been uncooperative.The controversy has raised concerns among the wider WordPress community and related projects about potential future actions by Automattic. There are fears that trademark enforcement, such as those filed for terms like ""Managed WordPress"" and ""Hosted WordPress,"" could impact developers and service providers, leaving them anxious about relying on commercial open-source products linked to WordPress.","The WordPress community is facing a significant controversy involving WordPress founder and Automattic CEO, Matt Mullenweg, and WP Engine.

How to get your CIBIL Credit score without a PAN Card

Factors affecting your CIBIL score

CIBIL credit score : Understanding your creditworthiness is pivotal in today's financial landscape, especially when seeking loans or credit cards. The Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited, commonly known as CIBIL, plays an important role in this regard by providing credit scores to borrowers.According to ET, credit score helps banks make informed decisions about extending credit cards and loans.Your credit history influences your CIBIL score , which is calculated using a special method.Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity. Ranging from 300 to 900, a higher score indicates a stronger likelihood of loan approval. Banks and financial institutions use this score to assess the risk associated with lending money.1. Go to the official CIBIL website and click on 'Personal CIBIL score,' then 'Get Your Free CIBIL score.' Follow the link provided and fill in all the required details.2. If you don’t have a PAN Card, you can use an alternative identification such as Passport, Voter ID, Driver’s License, or Ration Card. Enter the number of the chosen ID.3. Provide your date of birth, PIN code, and select your state. Finally, enter your mobile number and click on ‘Accept and Continue’.4. Authenticate your identity by entering the OTP (One-Time Password) delivered to your mobile device on the next screen. Click 'Continue' to proceed.5. Choose whether you want to link the device with your account. Select 'Yes' or 'No' based on your preference.6. Upon successful registration, you will see a page confirming that 'You have successfully registered!'7. Click on ‘Go to Dashboard’ to access and view your CIBIL score.The factors influencing the new CIBIL score, as stated on the CIBIL website, include:1. Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5. Number of new accounts opened and number of accounts closed: Opening or closing accounts can affect your score, so managing these actions wisely is important.","Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

New NPS rule from April 1 : The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has enhanced National Pension System (NPS) security by adding a new layer called two-factor Aadhaar authentication . Starting April 1, all users logging into the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) system with passwords must use this feature, as per the PFRDA circular dated March 15, 2024.According to ET, using two-factor authentication greatly lowers the risk of unauthorised access to the CRA system .

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Tinder has launched a Solo Traveler’s Guide to Tinder Passport with useful advice from The Hosteller, India’s largest self-operated backpacker hostel chain. The new guide is aimed to support Gen Z globetrotters in embracing the rising trend of solo traveling and building connections across the globe. The dating app has also updated its Passport Mode to appear directly on a user’s profile, letting others know that they are looking to make friends and connections before they even set foot in your destination.Users can easily activate PassportTM Mode by going into their settings, selecting a destination by city, or dropping a pin on the map to change their location. From there, they can start browsing profiles, liking, matching, and chatting with locals or fellow travelers even before they arrive.It also enables users to get a headstart on forming connections, gathering insider tips, and making plans — boosting their confidence to dive into independent adventures with new connections already in place. The guide covers a range of topics including curating the best profile to attract ideal matches.Here are some tips on how users can make the most out of their solo travel adventures with Tinder PassportTM:Line up local connections before you arrive: Use Tinder PassportTM to match with locals before your trip.

Be upfront in your conversations, as this helps to avoid misunderstandings, especially when crossing cultural boundaries.Prioritize safety: When meeting someone abroad, always remember to prioritize safety. Use Tinder’s features like Photo Verification and Share My Date, and meet up in public spaces.Be open to possibilities: A vacation romance can be thrilling, but it’s also important to manage your own expectations. Keep an open mind - sometimes a brief connection is just what you need and even if it doesn’t last, it could reignite your excitement for dating once you’re back home!","Users can easily activate PassportTM Mode by going into their settings, selecting a destination by city, or dropping a pin on the map to change their location.

Similar lawsuits have been filed against other AI companies, including OpenAI , Anthropic , and Microsoft Meta had argued that Zuckerberg lacked unique knowledge about the company's AI operations that couldn't be obtained from other employees.

What is the “Peaklight” malware

""This memory-only dropper decrypts and executes a PowerShell-based downloader. This PowerShell-based downloader is being tracked as PEAKLIGHT,”

How hackers can use Peaklight to infect Windows PCs

Connection to a hidden source: It connects to a content delivery network (CDN) that conceals harmful JavaScript code. This code executes directly in a computer's memory, leaving no trace on the system’s hard drive.

It connects to a content delivery network (CDN) that conceals harmful JavaScript code. This code executes directly in a computer's memory, leaving no trace on the system’s hard drive. Unleashing the malware downloader : The JavaScript then activates a PowerShell script named Peaklight.

The JavaScript then activates a PowerShell script named Peaklight. Downloading more threats: Peaklight acts as a downloader, retrieving additional malware from a remote server. This could include dangerous programs like Lumma Stealer, Hijack Loader, and CryptBot, which can steal user data or give attackers control of the user's computer.

""PEAKLIGHT is an obfuscated PowerShell-based downloader that is part of a multi-stage execution chain that checks for the presence of ZIP archives in hard-coded file paths. If the archives do not exist, the downloader will reach out to a CDN site download the remotely hosted archive file and save it to disk.”

A novel type of malware known as Peaklight has emerged and is specifically targeting individuals who engage in the downloading of movies from illicit websites. This “advanced” malware is designed to infect Windows computers, ultimately deploying information stealers and loaders. Security researchers affiliated with Google’s cybersecurity firm Mandiant have issued a stark warning regarding the potential risks associated with visiting such websites, which encompass not only legal repercussions but also the exposure to malware such as Peaklight.In a blog post, Mandiant claims that Peaklight is a new and stealthy malware that operates entirely within a computer's memory, leaving no trace on the hard drive which makes it difficult to detect. Security researchers claimed that this malware is designed to discreetly download additional harmful software onto infected Windows systems.Mandiant noted.Mandiant explained that Peaklight uses a covert PowerShell script to deploy additional malware onto infected systems. This method facilitates the distribution of harmful programs such as Lumma Stealer , Hijack Loader, and CryptBot. These programs are offered as services for rent, enabling cyber attackers to steal information or take control of compromised computers.As per the report, cybercriminals are spreading the malware through fake movie downloads. For this, hackers are hiding dangerous Windows shortcut files (LNKs) within ZIP folders disguised as popular films.Once opened, the LNK file triggers the following chain reaction:The report noted that the malware was particularly stealthy because it operates entirely within the computer's memory (RAM). This makes it very difficult for traditional antivirus software to detect, as most antivirus programs primarily scan the user’s hard drive for threats.Mandiant researchers Aaron Lee and Praveeth D'Souza said:","Malware known as Peaklight has emerged and is specifically targeting individuals who engage in the downloading of movies from illicit websites.

During a recent conversation with LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman , Nadella emphasised the critical qualities needed to navigate the evolving business landscape.""I think the world needs today, more than anything else from leaders, are optimism and energy ,"" Nadella stated.""It's easy to be down on everything [but] my true measure of any leader is who can come into a situation, bring clarity, generate energy, and solve over-constrained problems. As long as you do those three things, I think the world will be a better place.""Nadella's definition comes at a time when companies are facing significant challenges, particularly in managing remote work and employee expectations. The Microsoft CEO highlighted a ""productivity paradox"" that many organisations are experiencing:""Eighty-five percent of managers think their employees aren't working hard enough, while 85 percent of employees report feeling exhausted and overworked. And these are real statistics!"" he revealed.To address this disconnect, Nadella advocates for a data-driven approach to leadership. ""Dogma won't fix this issue,"" he explained. ""Leaders need to focus on clear, aligned goals and use data to measure output and performance.""The Microsoft CEP also stressed the importance of developing new soft skills to effectively manage employees in the changing work environment. ""People come for people, not policy,"" Nadella observed, suggesting that leaders must learn to create engaging occasions and events to bring teams together.""As leaders, we have to learn how to bring clarity to what is the output that you'd like to see. What are the measures of it and then using that to see whether it is working or not and then create the norms,"" he added.Nadella's insights offer a roadmap for leadership in the face of evolving workplace challenges. By focusing on optimism, energy, clarity, and data-driven problem-solving, leaders can work to bridge the gap between management expectations and employee experiences, ultimately fostering a more productive and harmonious workplace.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has outlined his vision of a "" true leader"" He emphasised the critical qualities needed to navigate the evolving business landscape.
