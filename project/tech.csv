The total berth capacity of the train will be 823 passengers, with 611 in AC 3 tier, 188 in AC 2 tier, and 24 in AC 1st.

The berths will have extra cushioning, better than Rajdhani Express trains. The side of each berth will be well-cushioned to ensure a comfortable travel experience.

The interior of the new Vande Bharat sleeper will feature a soothing color scheme, with shades of cream, yellow, and wood creating a pleasant ambiance.

Passengers will find it easier to access the upper and middle berths, thanks to a better-designed ladder.

Sensor-based lighting will be installed in common areas, while energy-efficient overhead lighting will provide adequate illumination.

The aisle areas will have strips on the floor to facilitate easier movement during the night.

Vande Bharat sleeper will have sensor-based inter communication doors, noise insulation and mitigation measures for silent saloon space, special berths and toilets for differently abled, automatic entry/exit passenger doors

To ensure a smooth and comfortable ride, the Vande Bharat sleeper train will use semi-permanent couplers, similar to those used in the existing Vande Bharat chair car trains. This technology will minimize jerks and provide a more pleasant travel experience for passengers.

The Vande Bharat sleeper train will feature fully sealed gangways, allowing for easy movement between coaches. Passengers can expect a well-regulated air-conditioning system that maintains a comfortable temperature and a dust-free environment, much like the Vande Bharat chair car trains.

The exterior design of the Vande Bharat sleeper train will be inspired by the ""prowess of eagles"", incorporating sleek lines and a ""fierce aura"".

As a semi-high-speed offering, the Vande Bharat sleeper train will be capable of reaching speeds of up to 160 kmph, with the prototype being tested at even higher speeds of up to 180 kmph.

Vande Metro: Top Features

Vande Metro is a self-propelled train set, similar to the Vande Bharat Express, which means it does not require a locomotive to pull it. The main goal behind the development of the Vande Metro is to replace Mainline EMU trains and provide passengers with quicker and more comfortable travel option.

Vande Metro trains will utilize rapid acceleration and deceleration technology to reach a top operational speed of 130 kmph, which is much higher than the speed of current Mainline EMUs.

The Vande Metro trains will be fitted with contemporary designed lightweight cushioned seats, accommodating 100 seated passengers per coach, with additional standing room for 200 individuals. The lightweight car body will contribute to the train's overall efficiency and performance.

To begin with Vande Metro trains will have fully air-conditioned coaches. The Vande Metro trains will be equipped with modern amenities to ensure a comfortable and efficient journey for passengers seeking a premium short-distance travel experience.

The trains will also feature fully sealed gangways, allowing for easier movement between coaches and a dust-free environment, similar to the Vande Bharat Express.

Vande Metro will have lightweight aluminium luggage racks and Passenger Information Systems with LCD displays. Passengers will enjoy automatic entry and exit doors, mobile charging sockets, diffused lighting, route indicator displays, and wider panoramic sealed windows with roller blinds.

From a safety aspect, Vande Metro trains will come equipped with the KAVACH train anti-collision system, CCTV cameras, emergency talk-back units and automatic fire detection and alarm systems. The trains will also have modular toilets with bio-vacuum systems.

The number of coaches in each Vande Metro train will be either 12 or 16, depending on the demand of the specific route. According to a TOI report, railway officials have indicated that Vande Metro trains are expected to operate on various routes, including Agra-Mathura, Delhi-Rewari, Lucknow-Kanpur, Tirupati-Chennai, and Bhubaneswar-Balasore.

In February 2023, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw first announced the Vande Metro. Currently, two prototypes are being built at RCF Kapurthala and ICF Chennai. These prototypes will now undergo extensive testing.

Vande Bharat sleeper , Vande Metro update: Indian Railways is all set to roll out two new trains for passengers in the coming days. Vande Bharat sleeper, a train expected to be much better than Rajdhani Express trains, is expected to be out for trial runs by August 15, railway officials told TOI. In the meantime, Vande Metro, another new train by Indian Railways, this time for short-distance intercity travel is ready and its trial runs will start soon, officials said.Indian Railways is currently developing a sleeper version of the Vande Bharat train, following the successful introduction of the chair car variant. The sleeper train is expected to offer superior features compared to the current premium overnight travel options, such as the Rajdhani Express and Tejas Express. BEML is manufacturing the first prototype,.On the other hand, Vande Metro, also known as the Vande Bharat Metro, is inspired by the semi-high speed Vande Bharat Express and aims to transform train travel for shorter distances.","Vande Bharat sleeper prototype will have 16 coaches, including 11 AC 3 tier coaches, and one AC 2 tier coaches.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme . This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy . Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

watchOS 11 brings automatic nap detection feature to Apple Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/watchos-11-brings-automatic-nap-detection-feature-to-apple-watch/articleshow/111072213.cms,"Apple recently showcased the latest version of its watchOS operating system — watchOS 11 at WWDC 2024 . Apple claims that the new watchOS 11 comes with features built on the company's sensor technology, advanced algorithms, and science-based approach. Now a new online report suggests that Apple has finally introduced the automatic nap detection feature with watchOS 11.

As reported by MacRumours, the watchOS 11 update eliminates the need to manually activate sleep mode. Previously, Apple Watch sleep tracking only functioned when users enabled sleep mode. This meant afternoon naps often went unrecorded, leaving users with an incomplete picture of their overall sleep health. The new automatic nap detection in watchOS 11 aims to bridge this gap.

As per the report, watchOS 11 leverages the watch's built-in motion sensors and sleep detection algorithms to identify naps. This allows users to see their nap duration and quality within the Health app 's sleep section, providing valuable insights into their overall sleep patterns.

While details are still emerging, automatic nap detection appears to function seamlessly. Users don't need to take any specific actions – simply take your nap, and the watch will handle the rest. This passive approach makes it incredibly user-friendly and aligns with the Apple Watch's focus on convenience.

The Cupertino-based tech giant has also confirmed that watchOS 11 will be available this fall as a free software update for Apple Watch Series 6 or later paired with iPhone Xs or later, running iOS 18 .

Limitations of the AI model

Google DeepMind researchers have developed an AI-powered model, called video-to-audio (V2A), that can generate audio and dialogues for videos. This development is a significant step towards creating fully audiovisual experiences using AI.The video-to-audio (V2A) AI tech can work well with videos that are generated by AI models, such as Google’s Veo that was announced at Google I/O 2024. The V2A technology works by combining video information with text prompts.Users can provide additional instructions to guide the V2A system towards specific sounds they want to create for a video, thus, allowing for creative control over the generated soundtrack.“Today, we're sharing progress on our video-to-audio (V2A) technology, which makes synchronised audiovisual generation possible. V2A combines video pixels with natural language text prompts to generate rich soundscapes for the on-screen action,” the company said.“Our V2A technology is pairable with video generation models like Veo to create shots with a dramatic score, realistic sound effects or dialogue that matches the characters and tone of a video,” it added.V2A first encodes the video and then uses a diffusion model to refine random noise into realistic audio that matches the video and any text prompts provided. Finally, the audio is decoded and combined with the video data.Some of the use cases include generating soundtracks for silent videos or traditional footage, including archival materials and silent films.“To generate higher quality audio and add the ability to guide the model towards generating specific sounds, we added more information to the training process, including AI-generated annotations with detailed descriptions of sound and transcripts of spoken dialogue,” Google DeepMind said.The AI model is trained on video, audio and the additional annotations which is said to help it associate specific audio events with various visual scenes, at the same time, responding to the information provided in transcripts.As per the researchers, the quality of the generated audio depends on the quality of the video input and lip movements in videos generated by other models might not perfectly match the soundtrack created by V2A.","Google DeepMind researchers have developed an AI-powered model, called video-to- audio (V2A), that can generate audio and dialogues for videos.

Apple co-founder Steve Jobs is known for a relentless pursuit of quality. Jobs' meticulous attention to detail -- which is also a hallmark of Apple products -- can be traced back to a lesson from his father. According to Walter Isaacson -- who wrote Jobs' biography -- the former CEO of Apple learned this lesson while building a fence.“You’ve got to make the back of the fence, that nobody will see, just as good looking as the front of the fence,” Walter Isaacson recounted Paul (Steve Jobs father) telling him, “Even though nobody will see it, you will know, and that will show that you’re dedicated to making something perfect.”Jobs told Walter Isaacson about his father, “He loved doing things right.”According to Isaacson, Steve Jobs' meticulous attention to detail extended to even the unseen aspects of Apple products. Isaacson highlights Jobs' insistence on the aesthetics of microchip interiors and the use of ""expensive plating"" on every screw.“When you’re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall,"" Steve Jobs said on what he learnt from his father.Jobs' dedication to detail was evident in the launch of the first iPhone . While competitors largely focused on features, Jobs oversaw every aspect of the user experience and talked about how the rounded corners of the iPhone was the result of months of refinement to feel comfortable in the hand.He also highlighted that the user interface underwent countless iterations to ensure a clean and intuitive layout. The launch presentation itself was designed so well that Jobs demonstrated features with ease. The result was a product that was not only feature-rich but one that felt well-designed and pleasure to use.","Steve Jobs' meticulous attention to detail can be traced back to a lesson from his father.

Unusual battery drain: A sudden and significant decrease in battery life can indicate that malicious software is running in the background, consuming power.

Overheating: While some heating is normal during heavy usage, consistent overheating can be a sign of malware or spyware running on your device.

Increased data usage: Unexpected spikes in data usage may indicate that your phone is sending information to a third party without your knowledge.

Strange activity: If you notice unusual activities such as apps opening on their own, text messages you didn't send, or calls you didn't make, your phone might be compromised.

Pop-ups and ads: An influx of pop-up ads, especially when not using a browser, can be a sign of adware infection.

Unrecognised apps: If you find apps installed that you don't remember downloading, it could be a sign of unauthorised access.

Slow performance: A sudden drop in your phone's performance speed can be a result of malware hogging resources.

Unusual charges on your bill: Unexpected charges for premium services or international calls might indicate that a hacker is exploiting your phone.

Immediate actions to take if your phone is hacked

Disconnect from the internet: The first step is to disconnect your phone from the internet to stop any data transfer. Turn off Wi-Fi and mobile data immediately.

Enable aeroplane mode: Switch your phone to aeroplane mode to cut off all communication signals, preventing further access by the hacker.

Check and remove suspicious apps: Go through your installed apps and delete any that seem suspicious or that you don’t remember installing.

Change passwords: Using another device, change the passwords for all your important accounts, including email, social media, and banking apps. Ensure that the new passwords are strong and unique.

Install and run security software: Install reputable mobile security software and run a full scan to detect and remove any malware or spyware.

Update your phone’s OS and apps: Ensure your phone’s operating system and apps are up-to-date. Updates often include security patches that fix vulnerabilities.

Factory reset: If the problem persists, consider performing a factory reset. This will erase all data and settings, returning your phone to its original state. Make sure to back up important data before doing this.

Contact your service provider: Inform your mobile service provider about the issue. They can provide assistance and may have additional security measures to help protect your account.

Monitor your accounts: Keep a close eye on your bank and other important accounts for any suspicious activity and report it immediately.

Preventative measures

Use strong, unique passwords: Ensure all your accounts are protected with strong, unique passwords. Consider using a password manager.

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security by enabling two-factor authentication on your accounts.

Be cautious with downloads: Only download apps from reputable sources like the official app stores and avoid clicking on suspicious links.

Regularly update your device: Keep your phone’s operating system and apps updated to protect against known vulnerabilities.

Install security software: Use mobile security software to protect against malware, spyware, and other threats.

Avoid public Wi-Fi: Public Wi-Fi networks can be insecure. Use a VPN if you need to access sensitive information over public Wi-Fi.

Google rolls out Pixel Camera 9.4 update with Pro lens selection and improved HDR+,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/google-rolls-out-pixel-camera-9-4-update-with-pro-lens-selection-and-improved-hdr/articleshow/111060782.cms,"Google has begun releasing a significant update to its Pixel Camera app, bringing new features and enhancements to several Pixel smartphone models . Version 9.4 of the app, which is currently rolling out via the Google Play Store, adds a Pro Lens selection mode and improves the HDR+ functionality on supported Pixel phones like the Pixel 6 Pro, Pixel 7 Pro, Pixel 8 Pro and Pixel Fold.One of the key additions in Pixel Camera 9.4 is the new Pro Lens selection feature. This allows users to manually choose between the ultra-wide, wide, and telephoto lenses on their device when taking a photo, rather than relying on the camera app to automatically select the appropriate lens. The Pro Lens option can be found under a new ""Pro"" tab in the camera settings.The update also brings improvements to HDR+ ( High Dynamic Range Plus ), Google's computational photography technology that combines multiple exposures to create images with better detail and dynamic range. Pixel Camera 9.4 enhances HDR+ with smarter automatic frame selection, favouring shots where subjects have their eyes open and are smiling.Additionally, the placement of the RAW/JPEG toggle has been moved from an obscure location in the settings to the more easily accessible Pro tab. However, unlike the Pixel 8 Pro, there is no option to adjust the image resolution.While the new version of Pixel Camera is currently available for download, users may not see the new features immediately after installing the update. The additional functionality is expected to be enabled via a server-side update from Google or with the release of the June Pixel Feature Drop .","Google has begun rolling out version 9.4 of its Pixel Camera app. It adds a Pro Lens selection mode and improves the HDR+ functionality on supported Pixel phones.

Steven Spielberg startled by Apple Watch’s false alarm: Here’s what happened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/steven-spielberg-startled-by-apple-watchs-false-alarm-heres-what-happened/articleshow/111052524.cms,"What exactly happened

What is Apple Watch’s fall detection feature

Legendary director Steven Spielberg had a moment of onstage surprise during a recent Tribeca Film Festival talk. According to a report by Variety, his Apple Watch abruptly displayed a warning about a potential hard fall, causing a brief disruption.The incident occurred while Spielberg was discussing his early films. The Apple Watch's fall detection feature, designed to initiate emergency services after a tumble, mistakenly interpreted a movement as a fall. Spielberg, likely startled by the unexpected alert, reportedly removed the watch from his wrist.Unfortunately, this reaction triggered another failsafe. With no response from Spielberg to the on-screen prompt, the Apple Watch initiated an audible countdown before attempting an emergency call. However, Spielberg realised the situation and quickly silenced the alert before any unnecessary dispatch of emergency personnel.While such false alarms are uncommon with Apple Watches, they can occur at inconvenient times. The episode highlights the potential for these safety features to cause momentary confusion, especially when users are unaware of the proper response protocol.In this case, a simple press of the ""X"" on the watch screen would have dismissed the fall warning.Apple Watch's fall detection feature is designed to identify when you've taken a hard fall and potentially connect you with emergency services.“If Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch Series 4 or later, or Apple Watch Ultra or later detects a hard fall while you’re wearing your watch, it will tap you on the wrist, sound an alarm and display an alert. You can choose to contact the emergency services, or dismiss the alert by pressing the Digital Crown, tapping Close in the top left-hand corner or tapping “I'm OK”, said the company.","Apple Watch's fall detection feature is designed to identify when you've taken a hard fall and potentially connect you with emergency services.

However, new reports claim that it will arrive in 2025 with the iPhone 17 series.Mark Gurman , in its latest Power On newsletter, has revealed that Apple will be making an iPhone 17 with a slimmer overall chassis and this will be the thinnest-ever iPhone along with a slimmer version of MacBook Pro and Apple Watch.Apple plans to go “Slim” in 2025Based on the report, Apple is reportedly planning to go slim with almost every product it offers. An iPhone 17 Slim , MacBook Pro Slim, Apple Watch Slim and so on. While these names are just for reference, it will be worth the wait to see what nomenclature Apple choose for the upcoming devices with the thinner form factor.We also don’t know whether Apple will make an additional device alongside the regular iPhone, the Plus, Pro and Pro Max or it will give the slim treatment to just the Pro models like it has done with the new iPhone Pro devices.Apart from the usual upgrades like a new chipset, better display, batter and camera improvements, the major highlight will likely be the slimmer design of the iPhone 17. Additionally, we expect the phone to include existing and new AI features that the company announced atthe recently concluded Worldwide Developers Conference ( WWDC ), earlier this month.","Apple is reportedly planning to go slim with almost every product it offers.
