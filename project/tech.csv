Sporting News suggests moving on from Buddy Hield, whose shooting slump has become a liability. Instead, they propose targeting Miami Heat's Bam Adebayo, a versatile two-way player who could provide scoring, playmaking, and defensive prowess to bolster the Warriors' championship aspirations.

Bam Adebayo: The Ideal Frontcourt Upgrade

How Adebayo Fits with the Golden State Warriors

Thenarrowly escaped a Play-In disaster against the Memphis Grizzlies , securing the No. 7 seed in the Western Conference. But even with their postseason spot locked in, changes may be necessary this offseason—starting with moving on from Buddy Hield and pursuing Miami Heat star, as predicted by Caleb Hightower of Sporting News Buddy Hield’s early-season promise as a Klay Thompson replacement has faded. His three-point shooting, once reliable, has plummeted to concerning lows:- December: 30.5% from three- January: 31.5% from three- Play-In performance: 1-of-4 from deep against MemphisWhile Hield finished the regular season at 37.0% from beyond the arc, his inconsistency makes him a liability. As Caleb Hightower noted,If the Golden State Warriors exit the playoffs early, targeting Bam Adebayo in a trade could reshape their roster. The three-time All-Star has evolved into a complete two-way force:- 2024-25 Stats: 18.1 PPG, 9.6 RPG, 4.3 APG- Shooting Splits: 48.5% FG, 35.7% 3P- Versatility: Scores inside, handles the ball, and stretches the floorAdebayo’s growth from a defensive specialist to an offensive weapon addresses Golden State’s need for a dynamic big man.1. Scoring Boost: Provides interior scoring and mid-range efficiency.2. Playmaking: Adds a facilitator from the high post.3. Defensive Anchor: Complements Draymond Green’s versatility.The Trade ScenarioA Hield-Adebayo swap wouldn’t improve the Warriors’ outside shooting, but it would give them a proven All-Star to pair with Stephen Curry and Draymond Green. Miami, meanwhile, could benefit from Hield’s shooting if they retool their roster.Potential Trade Package- Warriors Receive: Bam Adebayo- Heat Receive: Buddy Hield, future draft picks, and/or young playersAlso read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Los Angeles predicted to acquire 6-foot-8 Brooklyn Nets forward to form Big 3 with LeBron James and Luka Doncic Golden State's postseason performance will determine how urgent they are, but it makes sense to move from Hield to Adebayo. According to Hightower's research, Bam Adebayo's adaptable style of play could be crucial to the Golden State Warriors' next championship run.","Golden State Warriors narrowly avoided a Play-In disaster against the Memphis Grizzlies.

Is the New Zealand Trick Safe, and Will I Get Banned? - LearnToDIY360.com

What Is the New Zealand Trick?

up to 18 hours

Can It Work for Oblivion Remastered?

If Oblivion Remastered gets a global digital launch based on local timezones, then yes — you might be able to use the New Zealand trick to jump in early.

But if it launches at a fixed global time (say, April 21 at 12 PM EST), then changing your region won’t help. The game will unlock for everyone at the exact same moment, no matter where you are in the world.

The Oblivion Remaster Is REAL… And There’s More Than One!

Is the Trick Worth Trying?

Final Thoughts

Oblivion Remastered

If you’re a die-hard Elder Scrolls fan, you’re probably already counting down the seconds to the release of. But here’s the million-gold question floating around the community right now — can you use the classic “New Zealand trick” to play it early?If you’ve ever wanted to play a game early on release day, you’ve probably heard of this trick. The “New Zealand trick” is a method that involves changing your console or PC's location to New Zealand — the first country to roll into a new calendar day due to time zones.Because games tied to global digital launches often unlock based on the region’s local time, New Zealand players sometimes get access to gamesbefore others. Players in the U.S., UK, or Europe often change their region to New Zealand to piggyback on this early access window.It’s totally legal, easy to do, and has been a long-time favorite move for gamers looking to jump in early.Short answer: It depends on how Bethesda handles the launch.Right now, there’s strong speculation that the game might shadow drop soon, possibly as early as April 21. But whether it's a timed unlock or a rolling launch hasn’t been confirmed yet.Honestly, yes — if you're playing on Xbox or PC via Game Pass, switching your region to New Zealand is quick and safe. Worst-case scenario, it doesn’t work and you just wait like everyone else. Best-case? You're strolling through the Imperial City before your friends even finish their coffee.Just remember to switch your region back after the game unlocks. It can affect things like store currency, local apps, and services.With all the excitement (and rumors) swirling around, it’s hard to sit still. Whether Bethesda lets us sneak in through a time zone loophole or holds the line with a synchronized drop, one thing's clear — Tamriel is calling again, and it's going to look better than ever.","The “New Zealand trick” is a method that involves changing your console or PC’s location to New Zealand.

What the Kardashians said about Lauren Sanchez’s Blue Origin space flight



“This is a really unique experience and we’re just so honored to be here to support them and watch this amazing part of history, and I’m so proud of her,”

How Sanchez solved NASA's 'uniform problem' before her Blue Origin flight



Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ' fiancée, Lauren Sánchez, received a space-themed gift from Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and Khloé Kardashian after her recent Blue Origin Space flight. The Kardashians gave Sanchez a Judith Leiber handbag shaped like an UFO, valued at $6,995. The UFO Orbiter bag features star-shaped and geometric crystals, aligning with the theme of the Blue Orgin's Space flight. Sánchez shared the gift on her Instagram story (seen by Page Six), describing it as “Out of this world!” and tagged the three Kardashian sisters.

World Earth Day: Grounding Rituals and Healing Plants for Each Moon Sign on Earth Day 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/astrology/zodiacs-astrology/world-earth-day-grounding-rituals-and-healing-plants-for-each-moon-sign-on-earth-day-2025/articleshow/120504649.cms,"Written by: Sidhharrth S Kumaar, Registered Pharmacist, Astro Numerologist, Life & Relationship Coach, Vaastu Expert, IKS Expert, I Ching Expert, Energy Healer, Music Therapist, and Founder, NumroVani..!!

More than a reminder for the environment, World Earth Day is a call to action to reconnect with the actual dirt supporting us. Honoring Earth Day in today's hectic society, where devices and calendars frequently cut our link to nature, provides a strong moment of stop. Approaching it from an astrological perspective makes it even more intimate.Our Moon sign controls our emotional universe how we feel at home, nurtured, and safe. Aligning Earth Day practices with the emotional character of your Moon sign can help you to develop not just outer sustainability but also inner equilibrium. Every Moon sign has a way to strengthen its relationship with Mother Earth.AriesPeople with Aries Moon flourish on activity and rapid outcomes. A brief, high-energy nature walk or barefoot sprint on natural ground might serve as a strong grounding ceremony for Earth Day. Gather little leaves or stones as you go to build a natural shrine at home. Basil fast-growing, spicy in flavor, and refreshing in scent is the perfect plant for Aries Moon. Caring for basil feeds your desire for drive even as it teaches patience.TaurusFor Taurus Moon, comfort and stability are paramount. On this Earth Day, consider a grounding practice involving gradual gardening repotting a plant or making organic compost. Take deep, calm breaths and let your hands completely sink into the earth. Taurus Moon finds emotional stability in beauty and development, thus the money plant (pothos) or peace flower are ideal friends. These plants stand for harmony and success as well as beauty.GeminiGemini Moon craves cerebral challenge and levity. A suitable ritual is a nature diary walk during which you draw trees and leaves or record observations. Sitting beneath a windy tree and doing breathing exercises also help to clear up. The perfect plant is lemongrass; simple to maintain, fragrant, and revitalising. Its pleasant aroma and usefulness in herbal teas fit your inquisitive and expressive emotional profile.CancerCancer Moon longs for emotional stability and gentleness. Reconnect by intentionally watering flora or putting your hands on a tree and saying quiet thankfulness. Outdoor salt-water foot soaks assist to discharge emotional residue as well. Aloe vera expresses your maternal nature, heals, and calms, thus it really speaks to your caring instinct. Keeping it near your bedroom or kitchen offers both comfort and practicality.LeoLeo Moon wants acknowledgment, warmth, and life. Begin Earth Day with a solar salutation outdoors or compose an appreciation note to the solar, which regulates your expressive energy. Bury it under a thriving plant to return it to nature. Your soul plant is sunflowers bold, bright, and always attracted to light. Caring for them fosters self-love and heart-centered happiness.VirgoVirgo Moon discovers emotional security in order, purity, and utility. Peace will come from a routine of arranging your balcony or garden plants using labelled pots. Equally soothing is cleaning and renewing the soil of your indoor plants. Neem is your botanical friend antibacterial, cleansing, and therapeutic. It shows your strong will to serve, heal, and purify both inside and without.LibraThe Libra Moon is characterized by balance and harmony. Consider meditating on thankfulness while holding a bowl of water filled with flower petals. As a conscious gift, you may also create a floral mandala using petals and fallen leaves. Lavender fits your need for emotional elegance and inner serenity with its soothing aroma and beautiful look. It also attracts pollinators, so helping to maintain the balance of nature.ScorpioScorpio Moon is marked by intensity and emotional depth. On Earth Day, consider a ritual of silence: sit near water or in a quiet green area let the surroundings reflect your emotional undercurrents.

TOI Correspondent from London:

Over the years, patrons of Britain’s oldest Indian restaurant, ‘Veeraswamy’, have included Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Charlie Chaplin, Winston Churchill, Marlon Brando, Sharon Stone and David Cameron.A haunt of Indian maharajas and European royalty too, the King of Denmark even shipped out a cask of Carlsberg for staff to store for whenever he dined there.Now the Michelin-starred restaurant , which opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London, and today serves pineapple curry and chicken makhana au vin, is at threat of closure as the Crown Estate (property portfolio owned by King Charles), which owns Victory House, the building in which the restaurant is based, is refusing to renew its lease, which expires in June.The Crown Estate claims it needs to take the restaurant space back to extend the ground floor reception for offices on the building’s upper floors. Knocking through into Veeraswamy would give it an extra 11 sq mts.Veeraswamy’s founder, Edward Palmer, was the great-grandson of General William Palmer, and his wife, Begum Faiz Baksh, a Mughal princess. Gen Palmer was private secretary to Warren Hastings, first governor-general of the Presidency of Fort William. It was acquired by Ranjit Mathrani and Namita Panjabi in 1996.“Had they wanted to, they could’ve easily put the office reception on the first floor. I think they’ve come to the view that it’s too tiresome having a restaurant there, they want it to be all offices,” Mathrani (81), told the Times of London.If the Crown Estate refuses to allow the restaurant to stay put until he finds and fit out an alternative space, with its iconic décor inspired by the art nouveau of the 1920s and maharaja’s palaces, the restaurant will have to close, leading to possible redundancies and loss of business until a new site is found.Mathrani is taking the Crown Estate to court.A spokesperson for The Crown Estate told TOI: “The Crown Estate has a duty to generate value for the nation, while acting as responsible stewards for this historic part of London. We need to carry out a comprehensive refurbishment of Victory House. This includes a major upgrade to the offices and improving the entrance to make it more accessible. Due to the limited options available in this listed building we need to remove the entrance to the restaurant, which means we will not be able to offer Veeraswamy an extension when their lease expires.”","Michelin-starred restaurant Veeraswamy opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London.

Black or White: What smoke colours mean when a new Pope is chosen,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/black-or-white-what-smoke-colours-mean-when-a-new-pope-is-chosen-pope-francis-dead/articleshow/120478703.cms,"From wet straw to smoke bombs

Chemical recipes revealed

Behind the scenes: Engineering the ritual

Why not more colors?

In an age of digital alerts and global livestreams, the Vatican continues to announce one of its most significant decisions with a signal that dates back centuries: a puff of smoke from a copper chimney on the Sistine Chapel. But behind this seemingly simple ritual lies a surprisingly complex chemistry lesson.As 115 cardinal-electors gather in secret to choose the next pope, all eyes remain fixed on the chapel’s rooftop chimney. Black smoke (fumata nera) means the cardinals have not reached the two-thirds majority required, 77 votes, to elect a new pope. White smoke (fumata bianca) signals success. Yet, for this symbolic act to be visible and unambiguous, the Vatican has had to modernize the process, turning to science to uphold its most sacred tradition, ABC news reported.Historically, white smoke was created by burning wet straw, and black smoke by burning pitch or tar. But this produced inconsistent results, with ambiguous grey smoke confusing observers and media alike. So in 2005, ahead of the conclave that elected Benedict XVI, the Vatican introduced a second stove and a chemical method to ensure clarity.Now, when ballots are burned in the original cast-iron stove, which is about 3 feet high and 19 inches wide. It triggers a smoke-producing device in a second, modern stove. This device contains a cartridge holding five chemical ""charges,"" which are loaded one at a time. The charges produce smoke that lasts about seven minutes, enough time for it to be clearly seen by onlookers in St. Peter’s Square.The Vatican has disclosed the specific chemical recipes used:A mix of potassium perchlorate, anthracene, and sulphur, BBC reported.Anthracene, derived from coal tar, is particularly good at producing thick, black, sooty smoke. Though effective, it's also carcinogenic, which is why it’s no longer used in fireworks displays.Sulphur, a traditional gunpowder component, burns easily and enhances the smoke density.Potassium perchlorate serves as the oxidizer, supplying oxygen to sustain the combustion.A mix of potassium chlorate, lactose (milk sugar), and rosin (pine resin, often used on violin bows for friction).These ingredients are safer and more environmentally friendly than alternatives like zinc dust or hexachloroethane, which can be toxic and are commonly used in military-grade smoke bombs.Though these mixtures may sound exotic, they are essentially well-known pyrotechnic formulas, carefully chosen for visibility, safety, and tradition.Both stoves are connected via a joint exhaust pipe that leads to the chapel’s iconic chimney. To ensure the smoke’s successful appearance, the fuel is electrically heated and backed by air fans to keep the plume steady and visible. Vatican officials have likely tested the process thoroughly to avoid scenarios where large sooty flakes break into smaller ones, potentially changing black smoke into white midair, a known issue in bonfires.While the current system is reliable and rooted in centuries of tradition, some observers can’t help but imagine a more colorful future. Rainbow-colored smoke, like that used in air shows and military displays, is made by adding bright pigments or dyes such as indigo and rhodamine.Could beige smoke signal a break? Amber an impending decision? Burgundy a celebration? So far, the Vatican has resisted any such modern flourishes. For now, the ritual remains a solemn black-or-white affair, with centuries of history preserved by a precisely timed chemical reaction.As the world awaits the next puff of smoke, it’s worth remembering that the spectacle is more than just symbolic, it’s also a triumph of science in service of tradition.","The Sistine Chapel's chimney is used to announce a new pope's election.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

“One potentially crazy idea is to consider wiping everyone’s graphs and having them start again,”

Concerns over platform stability and Instagram

“I’m not sure Option #1 in your proposal (Double-down on Friending) would be viable given my understanding of how vital the friend use case is to IG,”

Why Facebook was looking for drastic fixes

Zuckerberg’s old emails resurface in FTC monopoly trial against Meta

“It is better to buy than compete.”

Zuckerberg says Facebook is still Meta’s core pillar

“Even if Instagram and WhatsApp do well, I don’t see a path to success for Meta if Facebook falters.”

Billionaire CEO, billion-dollar pressure



In a startling revelation from internal emails presented during an ongoing antitrust trial, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg ’s radical suggestion to “wipe everyone’s graphs” on Facebook has resurfaced, drawing attention to the extreme lengths leadership once considered to reinvigorate the platform’s relevance. The proposal, which involved erasing every user’s friend list to force a social re-engagement reset, offers a rare glimpse into the executive-level desperation to maintain Facebook’s user interest in an era increasingly dominated by competitors like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat.Although the idea was ultimately dismissed, the now-public emails have fueled renewed scrutiny of Facebook’s growth tactics and its dependence on legacy social structures—especially as Meta continues facing legal and reputational challenges around monopolistic behavior. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the origin, implications, and fallout of this eyebrow-raising strategy.The revelation stems from internal communications dated 2022, disclosed during the Federal Trade Commission's ongoing antitrust case against Meta. In an email sent to senior executives, Mark Zuckerberg proposed what he described himself as a “potentially crazy idea” under the header “Option 1. Double down on Friending.”Zuckerberg wrote, referring to the core social connections—“friend graphs”—that form the backbone of Facebook’s architecture.The idea centered around reigniting engagement by forcing users to reconnect from scratch, potentially making the platform feel more like a fresh social discovery network rather than a stagnant feed of old acquaintances.The proposal was met with immediate concern by top executives within Meta. Tom Alison, then head of Facebook, pushed back strongly on the idea. He warned that disrupting the established friend graph could create significant instability not just for Facebook but also for its sister platform, Instagram, which relies heavily on user connections for feed curation, story sharing, and algorithmic recommendations.Alison wrote in response.This internal debate reflected a broader tension within Meta: how to evolve Facebook’s aging infrastructure without compromising the integrated social ecosystem that now spans Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.The context behind Zuckerberg’s controversial suggestion lies in Facebook’s waning cultural relevance. Founded in 2004, Facebook once dominated online social interactions. But as platforms like Instagram (acquired by Facebook in 2012) and TikTok surged in popularity—especially among younger users—Facebook's model of mutual friending began to seem outdated.Modern users increasingly prefer follower-based platforms where engagement is driven by interest-based discovery rather than personal relationships. Even Zuckerberg himself admitted in a separate 2022 email that he now prefers following surfers and MMA fighters on Instagram and X (formerly Twitter) rather than checking updates from Facebook friends.The friend graph deletion idea emerged during the high-profile antitrust trial launched by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in April 2024. The trial seeks to prove that Meta holds unlawful monopoly power in the digital market by acquiring rival platforms and suppressing competition.One of the key pieces of evidence in the FTC’s case is a 2008 internal email from Zuckerberg stating:The resurfacing of these internal communications has added weight to the FTC’s argument that Meta’s aggressive acquisition strategies were intentionally designed to eliminate threats, rather than innovate independently.Despite Meta’s branding shift toward futuristic ventures like the metaverse and AI, Zuckerberg has publicly stated that Facebook remains the cornerstone of the company’s success.In a 2022 internal email, he warned:This underscores why even unorthodox strategies—like deleting everyone’s friends—were seriously floated. Meta’s revenue, user engagement metrics, and advertising architecture are still deeply rooted in the Facebook experience, making the platform too critical to let stagnate.Mark Zuckerberg, now worth over $200 billion, has seen his company evolve from a college dorm project to one of the most powerful tech empires in the world. With this transformation has come immense pressure to sustain innovation and profitability, especially in the face of regulatory scrutiny and public skepticism.While some of his earlier college-era antics have morphed into family-friendly social media posts with his wife Priscilla Chan and their daughters, Zuckerberg remains at the helm of a tech juggernaut that is constantly trying to reinvent itself—sometimes in bizarre, headline-making ways.",Mark Zuckerberg once suggested deleting everyone’s Facebook friends to reignite engagement.

"Microsoft reveals how AI tools have made e-commerce fraud, job scams and tech support frauds more dangerous",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-reveals-how-ai-tools-have-made-e-commerce-fraud-job-scams-and-tech-support-frauds-more-dangerous/articleshow/120488112.cms,"

E-commerce fraud: AI creates convincing fake storefronts in minutes



Job scams: AI powers fake interviews and employment offers





Tech support fraud: AI enhances social engineering attacks



Microsoft, in its latest Cyber Signals report, says that artificial intelligence has significantly lowered barriers for cybercriminals, enabling more sophisticated and convincing fraud schemes. Between April 2024 and April 2025, Microsoft thwarted $4 billion in fraud attempts, rejected 49,000 fraudulent partnership enrollments, and blocked approximately 1.6 million bot signup attempts per hour.AI tools now allow fraudsters to create convincing e-commerce websites in minutes rather than days or weeks. These sites feature AI-generated product descriptions, images, and fake customer reviews that mimic legitimate businesses. AI-powered customer service chatbots add another layer of deception, interacting with customers and stalling complaints with scripted excuses to delay chargebacks.Microsoft reports that much of this AI-powered fraud originates from China and Germany, with the latter being targeted due to its status as one of the largest e-commerce markets in the European Union. To combat these threats, Microsoft has implemented fraud detection systems across its products, including Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Edge, which features website typo protection and domain impersonation detection using deep learning technology.Employment fraud has evolved with generative AI enabling scammers to create fake job listings, stolen credentials, and AI-powered email campaigns targeting job seekers. These scams often appear legitimate through AI-powered interviews and automated correspondence, making it increasingly difficult to identify fraudulent offers.Warning signs include unsolicited job offers promising high pay for minimal qualifications, requests for personal information including bank details, and offers that seem too good to be true. Microsoft advises job seekers to verify employer legitimacy by cross-checking company details on official websites and platforms like LinkedIn , and to be wary of emails from free domains rather than official company email addresses.While some tech support scams don't yet leverage AI, Microsoft has observed financially motivated groups like Storm-1811 impersonating IT support through voice phishing to gain access to victims' devices through legitimate tools like Windows Quick Assist. AI tools can expedite the collection and organization of information about targeted victims to create more credible social engineering lures.In response, Microsoft blocks an average of 4,415 suspicious Quick Assist connection attempts daily—approximately 5.46% of global connection attempts. The company has implemented warning messages in Quick Assist to alert users about possible scams before they grant access to their devices and developed a Digital Fingerprinting capability that leverages AI and machine learning to detect and prevent fraud.Microsoft is taking a proactive approach to fraud prevention through its Secure Future Initiative. In January 2025, the company introduced a new policy requiring product teams to perform fraud prevention assessments and implement fraud controls as part of their design process. Microsoft has also joined the Global Anti-Scam Alliance to collaborate with governments, law enforcement, and other organizations to protect consumers from scams.","Microsoft says artificial intelligence has significantly lowered barriers for cybercriminals.

China has reportedly marked a significant advancement in its internet infrastructure as it launched its first commercial 10-Gigabit (10G) broadband network in Sunan County , Hebei Province. The project, a collaborative effort between telecommunications giant Huawei and state-owned operator China Unicom , aims to deliver dramatically faster internet access.According to a report by The Economic Times, official specifications target download speeds of up to 9,834 Megabits per second (Mbps) – nearly 10 Gigabits per second (Gbps) – upload speeds around 1,008 Mbps, and network latency as low as 3 milliseconds.This ultra-fast network utilises next-generation 50G Passive Optical Network (PON) technology, which enhances data transmission capabilities over existing fiber-optic infrastructure .To illustrate the speed increase, downloading a large 20GB 4K movie, a task that might take 7-10 minutes on a typical 1Gbps connection, could potentially be completed in under 20 seconds using the new 10G service.The leap in speed enables easy handling of demanding high-bandwidth applications . Activities like cloud computing, immersive virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) experiences, streaming ultra-high-definition 8K video, and managing complex smart home ecosystems are expected to run significantly smoother.This deployment essentially positions China at the forefront of commercially available broadband technology, surpassing currently advertised top speeds in other leading nations like the UAE and Qatar.Beyond enhancing entertainment and consumer applications, the implementation of 10G broadband is anticipated to drive innovation across various sectors. Faster and more reliable data transmission is expected to facilitate advancements in fields such as telemedicine, remote education and data-intensive smart agriculture.","China has reportedly launched its first commercial 10-Gigabit (10G) broadband network.

How Nico Mueller secured the top spot

Andretti driver Nico Mueller and his race engineer Bertrand Mermine have surged to the top of the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard following a dramatic Miami Grand Prix, where post-race penalties reshuffled the final standings in Mueller’s favour. Though he originally crossed the line in 10th, Mueller was promoted to 4th, thanks to a well-timed strategy and a dash of late-race chaos. His calculated decision to split Attack Mode usage proved decisive, paying off when several drivers were hit with time penalties after the chequered flag.The Engineered to Outrun leaderboard celebrates the most dynamic driver-engineer duos in Formula E—tracking those who gain the most positions during a race, with emphasis on overtaking prowess, energy management, and overall race pace.

With a mega drive from P18 to P4, the @andrettife driver tops the @abbgroup Engineered to Outrun leaderboard after Round 5. #MiamiEPrix #FormulaE #Motorsport #Racing.”Nico Mueller’s rise was the result of strategy combined with fortunate timing. While many drivers delayed activating Attack Mode until later in the race, Mueller opted for a more aggressive strategy—using two four-minute activations, starting with the first on Lap 11 to position himself within points range.By Lap 20, Mueller was running in 10th when a red flag was brought out following a three-car collision. After the restart, as the majority of the grid scrambled to use their remaining Attack Mode activations, Mueller’s earlier strategy gave him an edge.Despite finishing 10th on the road, he was ultimately classified 4th after multiple post-race penalties were issued. Drivers including Norman Nato, Robin Frijns, Oliver Rowland, Sam Bird, and Taylor Barnard were penalized 10 seconds each for misuse of Attack Mode, while Nick Cassidy received a five-second penalty for exceeding track limits.Also Read: Formula E Miami E-Prix 2025: Jake Hughes crashes at chicane, here’s how the multi-car collision changed the outcome.

Could Shedeur Sanders be Big Blue’s next hope? Giants among top contenders for Coach Prime’s son,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/could-shedeur-sanders-be-big-blues-next-hope-giants-among-top-contenders-for-coach-primes-son/articleshow/120485789.cms,"Steelers, Saints and Giants emerge as frontrunners in Shedeur Sanders' NFL Draft destination sweepstakes (Credit: Getty Images)

Three teams. One quarterback. Shedeur Sanders’ draft story is turning into an NFL thriller



FIRST TAKE | Steelers or Giants are best fit for Shedeur Sanders! - Stephen A. Smith break NFL Draft

As the 2025 NFL Draft approaches, the buzz around Shedeur Sanders continues to intensify—and it’s no surprise why. With an impressive 2024 season behind him, throwing for 4,134 yards, 37 touchdowns, and only 10 interceptions, Sanders has emerged as one of the most intriguing quarterback prospects in the class. Though Bleacher Report ranks him as the No. 23 overall prospect and the No. 2 quarterback, his draft-day destination remains clouded in uncertainty.According to a report from ESPN’s Adam Schefter, the Pittsburgh Steelers could be the most logical landing spot for Shedeur Sanders, picking at No. 21. While some early projections had him linked with the New Orleans Saints at No. 9, Schefter cast doubt on that possibility. “When you talk to people around the league, I don’t think they believe the Saints are taking Shedeur Sanders,” Schefter said, before adding, “That is the spot (No. 21 for Pittsburgh) that makes the most sense.”The Steelers’ current quarterback situation only adds fuel to this speculation. Since Ben Roethlisberger’s retirement, the franchise has lacked a stable and elite presence under center. While Mason Rudolph sits atop the current depth chart, the franchise's long-term plans remain murky. Additionally, the Aaron Rodgers sweepstakes have yet to bear fruit, and with uncertainty mounting, a high-upside pick like Sanders could offer both a solution and a fresh start.However, it’s not a clear path for Pittsburgh. Teams like the Cleveland Browns and the New York Giants could complicate matters with potential trade-ups. Jeremy Fowler recently revealed on SportsCenter that the Browns “have love” for Sanders and admire his exceptional football IQ. “They like his sort of computer-mind processing ability at the line of scrimmage,” Fowler shared, adding that Cleveland could be tempted to trade up if Sanders falls outside the top 10.As for the Giants, there are whispers about them making a bold move. “There have been people who have pointed out: ‘Don’t be surprised if the Giants take Shedeur at 3,’” Schefter noted. “Do I think it’s happening? It doesn’t sound like it, but I don’t think it can be dismissed.”While the Browns currently sit with the No. 2 pick, many analysts believe they will look elsewhere early on—perhaps saving a trade for Sanders if he slides into the teens. The scenario could even involve packaging picks to land both Sanders and Colorado standout Travis Hunter , rekindling their dynamic college chemistry in Cleveland.Outside the top few picks, Miami QB Cam Ward is a strong favorite to go to the Titans at No. 1, which could leave the quarterback board wide open after that. The Saints, Giants, Browns, and Steelers all remain in the mix, each with varying degrees of need and draft capital to maneuver.As Green Bay gets ready to host the draft from April 24–26, one thing is certain: Shedeur Sanders’ name will be one of the most talked about leading up to—and likely during—draft night. Whether it's Pittsburgh, Cleveland, New York, or a surprise contender, the race to land the Colorado star is far from over.Also Read: Jayden Daniels wastes no time setting lofty goals for himself as he eyes a breakout season with the Commanders in 2025","Shedeur Sanders has emerged as one of the most intriguing quarterback prospects in the class.

Rumours of a wedding grow stronger as family ties deepen

In a surprising twist, pop sensation Taylor Swift and NFL superstar Travis Kelce have taken a noticeable step back from the spotlight in early 2025. But rather than signalling trouble, insiders claim this retreat could be a precursor to something far more exciting—wedding bells.While the couple's absence from red carpets, concerts, and major sporting events has puzzled fans, a new report from Life & Style sheds light on the couple’s intentions. According to a source close to the pair, their time away has only deepened their connection. “It’s been a dream period that’s only solidified that they’re on the same page about their future,” the insider revealed.The couple, who are nearing their two-year anniversary, have reportedly been using this downtime to invest in their relationship, family bonds, and long-term plans. The insider shared, “Taylor and Travis’ time out of the limelight has given them a taste of what life will be like when they’re married, not promoting anything, and not on anyone’s radar.”Both stars come from tightly-knit families, and their growing involvement in each other’s lives hasn’t gone unnoticed. Throughout 2023, Kelce’s family members were frequently spotted at Swift’s Eras Tour, while Swift’s parents were often seen cheering on the Kansas City Chiefs, sitting beside Kelce’s mother, Donna.This crossover has fuelled public speculation that the pair are preparing to take the next big step. According to the same source, “They’re amping up wedding discussions. It’s just a matter of when, not if.”What sets this relationship apart in the often-fleeting world of celebrity romance is its apparent stability. Swift and Kelce have reportedly spent the start of 2025 focusing on each other and exploring what their future together could look like without the constant gaze of paparazzi and fans.The insider concluded, “They already knew how compatible they were, but this break away from everything has allowed them to grow closer and be even more certain.”Also Read: Did Taylor Swift secretly prefer another football star before Travis Kelce?

Jarret Stoll calls out Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s generous gesture at Eras Tour

A growing friendship that goes beyond fame and cameras



When it comes to blending star power with generosity, Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift seem to be mastering the art. Recently, former NHL player Jarret Stoll — husband of NFL reporter Erin Andrews — opened up about the VIP experience he and his wife enjoyed during Swift’s Eras Tour , thanks to the couple’s personal invitation.However, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are facing accusations of using VIP perks to win over NFL elites. Critics claim their generous hospitality, like exclusive Eras Tour access, might be less about friendship and more about building influence within the league’s inner circle.Jarret Stoll, speaking on the April 16 episode of the Calm Down podcast, couldn’t stop gushing about the unforgettable night. “For a three and a half hour concert, it went by in an hour, basically. It seemed like an hour. We had a good setup,” he said, highlighting the surreal atmosphere of the show.He made sure to give credit where it was due, adding, “Shout out to Travis and Taylor for hooking us up in the tent."" That shout-out not only reflected genuine appreciation but also revealed just how hands-on and thoughtful the couple is with their inner circle — even amid one of the biggest tours in modern music history.This isn’t a one-off interaction. The relationship between Swift, Kelce, Andrews, and Stoll appears to be more than casual celebrity acquaintance. According to Page Six, the two couples even linked up for dinner at the Auric Room during Swift and Kelce’s vacation in Montana earlier this year.“Erin is close friends with Taylor and Travis, and Travis even jokingly credits Erin with encouraging Taylor to date him. They’re all good friends,” a source told the outlet. This nugget not only hints at Andrews playing a key role in one of pop culture’s favorite relationships but also speaks volumes about how grounded Swift and Kelce remain, cultivating real connections amidst their fame.Also Read: Are Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce secretly expecting their first child?

It was a small yet telling gesture — a nod to his down-to-earth nature and his ability to stay connected to those who support him and Swift.As the friendship between these couples grows, fans are loving the blend of sports, music, and genuine camaraderie that seems to follow Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce wherever they go.","Jarret Stoll, husband of NFL reporter Erin Andrews, opened up about the VIP experience he and his wife enjoyed during Swift’s Eras Tour.
