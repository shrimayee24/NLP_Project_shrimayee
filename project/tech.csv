star Anthony Edwards has addressed critiques regarding the team's. He asserted that it has a strategic importance in their gameplay. He further shared that the high volume of three-point attempts is a deliberate tactic designed to maximize scoring efficiency and stretch opposing defenses. Edwards believes this approach aligns with the modern NBA's emphasis on perimeter shooting. Additionally, the strategy has worked in the Timberwolves’ favor.Minnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards made it clear that teams aren’t just launching threes for no reason— they’re taking the best available shots. He pointed to the evolution of the game, where towering defenders like Victor Wembanyama make scoring inside much tougher.With elite rim protectors patrolling the paint, Edwards sees the three-pointer as a necessary tool to surprise their opponent. He believes spacing the floor and knocking down outside shots is key in today’s game. Of course, Edwards who also made his name for his bold response, does not care much about what critics and analysts say but in a recent interview, the Timberwolves star player made his point clear about shooting too many threes.""What they want us to do? It's four people in the paint,"" Edwards shared in his latest Complex cover story interview. ""If they leaving us open for the three ball, I think that's just taking what the game give you,"" he continued.The 23-year-old further shared that players like Victor Wembanyama have been one of the primary reasons for the heavy reliance on the threes. ""You got Wemby. You got these boys. They tall. They big. They blocking shots, man. We not forcing our way to the paint every time. So, everybody can think what they want to think, but I just feel like the game changes. Guys want to shoot threes and guys are good at it. The viewership is down. I don't know what they got to do, lower the rim or something?"" he told Complex.Although the move is quite necessary in today’s NBA games, the NBA All-Star did not hesitate to urge the players to refrain from using the strategy who are not comfortable with it. ""I think seeking out threes is too much. You got guys who're seeking out threes that aren't always great shooters,” Edwards stated.Also Read: Minnesota Timberwolves Anthony Edwards Allegedly Urged Ex to ‘Get Da Abortion’ in Leaked Texts Amid Paternity Battle: Details Inside “I get where the fans and past NBA players are coming from with that standpoint.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made a Twitter, now X request to his followers.

The post featured an Indian meme showing a person casually smoking while reclining on a ledge, watching a large crowd playing cricket in a field—a humorous take on passive observation. The image is accompanied by the caption, “Don’t be that guy who just watches every post but never interacts. Join the conversation—engage with posts on X”.Musk quoted the post, replying ‘Yes’.This is not the first time that Elon Musk has used a meme to share his opinion. Following last year’s Microsoft outage that affected businesses worldwide, Musk shared this same meme as a jab at the tech giant.The same year, he also shared a meme criticizing the Apple-OpenAI deal. Believed to be from the 2017 Tamil movie 'Thappattam', the tech billionaire shared the meme with the header of the photo that reads, ""How intelligence works"". The meme showed a man and woman sharing coconut water. The photo apparently aims to show how Apple sharing data with ChatGPT maker OpenAI could lead to privacy issues.Again in 2024, when X was suspended after a protracted legal battle between the country’s Supreme Court and the company over disinformation, Mush expressed his discontent with a meme depicting the flourishing VPN companies in Brazil after the ban on X.

Implosion Titan Oceangate How it Happened | Submersible Submarine Parts #3d

The US Coast Guard has released an eerie audio recording that it believes captures the final moments of the Titan submersible before it imploded deep in the Atlantic Ocean in 2023.The Titan submersible, operated by tourism company OceanGate, was on an expedition to the Titanic wreck when it imploded on June 18, 2023.The recording was picked up by an acoustic device from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (NOAA), located around 900 miles from the site of the disaster. It reportedly includes the sub’s “acoustic signature”—the unique sounds it emitted—followed by a sudden, loud bang, which experts suspect was the moment of implosion.Onboard were five passengers: OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush , British billionaire Hamish Harding, deep-sea explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, and Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood with his 19-year-old son, Suleman. All five lost their lives in the tragedy, which sparked a large-scale search and rescue effort.Following the incident, the US coast guard launched an investigation, holding multiple hearings in September last year. Experts, former OceanGate employees, and witnesses provided testimony on the possible causes of the disaster.The final report on the implosion, which is expected to outline what went wrong, has yet to be released.Last year, a former contractor revealed that OceanGate's Titan submersible relied on a manually updated Excel spreadsheet for navigation. Speaking at a US Coast Guard hearing, ex-contractor Antonella Wilby criticised the process as “absolutely idiotic,” stating that delays occurred as team members manually recorded and input latitude-longitude data. Former OceanGate engineer Tony Nissen also revealed he refused to participate in a test dive. The Titan lost communication at a depth of 3,346 meters, and used an ultra-short baseline (USBL) system to track its position, but data had to be transcribed from a notebook into a spreadsheet.","Chilling recording captures audio of final moments before Titan sub implosion in 2023.

Al-Nuri Mosque: Iraq’s leaning 'hunchback' minaret rises again after years in ruins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iraqs-leaning-hunchback-minaret-rises-again-after-years-in-ruins/articleshow/117977421.cms,"The Al-Hadba minaret in Mosul, Iraq, has been rebuilt, restoring its historic presence after being destroyed during ISIS rule. Known as the ""hunchback"" minaret, it earned its name due to its leaning shape.Unesco spearheaded the restoration of this architectural marvel, which stands as part of the Al-Nuri Mosque , utilising original brickwork in the reconstruction process.Abdullah Mahmoud from Iraq's antiquities department expressed the significance: ""Al-Hadba is our identity, and restoring it means the city has reclaimed its identity"". The 12th-century structure maintains its distinctive 160-centimetre lean, identical to its tilt in the 1960.The Al-Nuri Mosque, where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed his self-styled caliphate in July 2014, was razed in June 2017 during Mosul's liberation battle. Iraqi officials stated that IS forces planted explosives before withdrawing.The five-year Unesco restoration incorporated 26,000 original bricks for the exterior, with 96,000 new bricks added internally for structural support. The foundation received additional reinforcement to stabilise the tilt.The restoration effort extended to the mosque's columns, dome and courtyard. The mihrab was restored using original stonework, whilst the minbar required substantial reconstruction due to missing original components.Former muezzin Imad Zaki observes the restoration daily, stating: ""Every day I stand here for an hour to watch as they are restored to their original state. Today one can feel the spirituality. It's as if our souls have finally found peace.""Unesco's broader restoration initiative includes the Al-Tahira Church from 1862, featuring reconstructed arcades, pillars and stained-glass windows. Archaeological discoveries include an underground cellar and wine vessels, now displayed beneath glass flooring.Unesco Iraq's senior project manager Maria Acetoso noted the transformation: ""When I arrived here in 2019, it looked like a ghost city. In five years plus, there has been a massive change.""Despite progress, Mosul's recovery continues. The clearance of 12,000 tonnes of debris was necessary for landmark restoration, whilst numerous neighbourhoods remain damaged.In the Old City, buildings marked 'safe' in red indicate explosive clearance. Many former inhabitants, particularly Christians, await return.Mohammed Kassem, now residing in a new dwelling, believes the city requires further reconstruction and the return of its original residents, particularly the Christian community.Saad Mohammed, 65, residing opposite Al-Nuri Mosque, recounts the IS period: ""We opened the window once and saw the black IS flag on top of the minaret. Then we opened it again, and the minaret was gone."" Now, with restored landmarks, he remarks, ""Today the minaret has risen again. Now we feel safe.""","Unesco spearheaded the restoration of the Al-Hadba minaret in Mosul, Iraq.

Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic. In his memoir, Spare, the Duke of Sussex talks about reaching out to a medium with supernatural abilities to communicate with Diana, who passed away in a car accident in Paris in 1997, just before his 13th birthday, The Mirror reported.The Duke received a message from his mother through the psychic, who told him, ""You're living the life she wanted for you."" Harry, now 40, says that the medium also told him his mother was with him ""right now,"" which made his neck warm and his eyes fill with tears. The psychic shared that Diana knew Harry was ""looking for clarity"" and ""feels your confusion."" She added that Diana understood Harry had ""so many questions"" and that answers would come in time.Another anecdote involved Prince Harry’s son, Archie. The psychic reportedly described how Diana’s spirit witnessed Archie accidentally breaking a Christmas tree ornament shaped like Queen Elizabeth. When asked, Harry admitted the incident had occurred, adding that Archie had attempted to fix the ornament.The medium suggested Diana found humour in the situation, delighting in the antics of her grandson she never had the chance to meet.In Spare, Prince Harry also recounts an extraordinary encounter with a leopard during a trip to Botswana with his brother, Prince William. He interpreted the animal’s presence as a comforting sign from his late mother, suggesting that ""everything will be fine."" However, the experience was not without fear, as he briefly worried the leopard might attack.Harry has been candid about the psychological toll of losing Diana so young. As reported by The Mirror, he disclosed a haunting period after her death when he entertained the possibility that she had staged her demise. His anguish led him to repeatedly drive through the Paris tunnel where Diana’s life was cut short, attempting to make sense of the tragedy.","Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.

I'd say ballpark, twice a year, not the first, not the last,"" Huffman said, attempting to downplay concerns about the platform's traffic volatility.

""This one was particularly interesting because it really was a swing—down, but then a recovery shortly thereafter.

However, user growth fell short of Wall Street estimates, with daily active unique users reaching 101.7 million instead of the expected 103.8 million.Huffman pointed to some positive indicators amid the challenges, including an increase in Google searches containing the term ""Reddit"" on their search dashboard. The platform also reported strong international engagement, with a 46% rise in users from outside the US.The company has been working to reduce its dependence on external search traffic by developing tools like Reddit Answers, an AI-powered search feature that generates responses based on user contributions.

"Google clarifies changes they made in Google Calendar, says ‘contrary to some of the…’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-clarifies-changes-they-made-in-google-calendar-says-contrary-to-some-of-the/articleshow/118217376.cms,"Google Calendar

Why Google made changes to Google Calendar

Read the company’s full response

We’ve received some questions about the holidays and moments that are displayed in Google Calendar. We want to clarify that we made this change last year, globally.

Some years ago, the Calendar team started manually adding a broader set of moments in a wide number of countries around the world — things like cultural celebrations, teachers days and many more. We got feedback that many other events and countries were missing, and it just wasn’t feasible to put hundreds of moments in everyone’s calendars — so in mid-2024 we made the decision to simplify and show only public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com. Contrary to some of the comments on social media, this was not something we did just this year.

Some important things to note:

Showing public holidays and national observances, rather than a broader set of moments, is consistent with other major online calendar providers. Google Calendar is also customizable, so users can more easily add important moments to their calendar.

As a company, we continue to celebrate and promote a variety of cultural moments across our products, visible to people everywhere — as you saw in the last few weeks with Black History Month and Lunar New Year.","Google responded to questions about the holidays and moments that are displayed in Google Calendar.
