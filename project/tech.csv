Vande Bharat sleeper train launch: Indian Railways is looking to launch the first Vande Bharat sleeper train soon, with the first prototype rake undergoing changes after trial runs. Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has said that the aim is to launch the new Vande Bharat sleeper variant in December.The train has faced delays and after extensive trials of the first rake, changes have been suggested in the train to enhance passenger comfort. Vande Bharat Express has emerged as the new face of premium travel on Indian Railways. The AC chair car version, which is currently in service, caters to day travel needs. The new Vande Bharat sleeper train will look to offer superior comfort to Rajdhani Express trains on long-distance overnight routes.Ashwini Vaishnaw has said that the train will be launched in December. ‘Minor’ retrofitting work is in progress on the first Vande Bharat sleeper train to enhance passenger comfort, with the modified train set to debut next month, according to Vaishnaw.PTI quoted Vaishnaw as saying that after the trials of the first train, recommended modifications to the bogie and seats are currently being done. Vaishnaw confirmed that issues identified during the first rake's testing are being resolved in both the first and second trains.He explained that whilst the modifications are relatively small, they are being treated with significant importance to ensure optimal passenger comfort levels.“Changes are minor in nature, but we are treating them as major because we want to match the high standards of passenger comfort,” he said.Highlighting the focus on passenger welfare and safety, he emphasised their commitment to avoiding shortcuts to develop a quality product for future generations.According to the PTI report, BEML officials have confirmed receiving back the first prototype of Vande Bharat sleeper trains for modifications, following comprehensive testing and trials overseen by RDSO and the Commissioner of Railway Safety. The company is tasked with manufacturing 10 such trains.""Since it is a prototype, it is very natural to test the train on all safety and comfort parameters. The first rake is back with us after intensive testing along with the suggested modifications,"" a BEML official said.The Railway Ministry officially approved the introduction of 16-car Vande Bharat Sleeper trains on October 28, whilst recommending specific alterations for enhanced performance in the future.The safety requirements include installing Arc Fault Detection Device for fire prevention, AC duct repositioning, CCTV fire-survival cable implementation and independent assessment of European fire safety (EN 45545) and crash resistance (EN 15227) standards, amongst other measures.""Emergency alarm button and its indication sign board is found to be hidden behind the upper berth connector console and appear inaccessible to passengers for operation in emergency situations. This needs to be suitably relocated at an appropriate accessible location in the future production,"" said the October 28 letter.The ministry sent an additional letter on October 28 to RDSO and all zonal railways highlighting concerns regarding the train's interior finishing and construction quality.","The new Vande Bharat sleeper train will be a semi-high speed, self-propelled train set, capable of 160 kmph speed, and a testing speed of 180 kmph.

Grok's loyalty known no bounds - AI chatbot chooses Elon Musk over LeBron James in a 'Who is the fittest' comparison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/groks-loyalty-known-no-bounds-ai-chatbot-chooses-elon-musk-over-lebron-james-in-a-who-is-the-fittest-comparison/articleshow/125471772.cms,"Elon Musk ; LeBron James (Image via X)

Grok is a loyal Elon Musk groupie

It is one thing to stay loyal to your maker, it is another to pick him over any and everyone, while making weird analogies. That's exactly what is currently happening, as the X (formerly Twitter) AI chatbot - Grok, decided to choose Elon Musk , its owner, over none other than LeBron James - and that too, when asked whom among these two individuals was the fittest.The AI had the weirdest analogies - and while initially it tried to give a neutral answer, when asked point blank to choose one over the other, it ended up going Musk's way, showing where its loyalty lies. And not just LeBron, Grok has been choosing Musk over anyone in whatever situation it is presented with. Isn't that sweet!Fans are having a gala time, trying to make Grok decide on who is a better individual - Elon Musk, or anyone else in this world. And to the amusement of everyone, Grok has decided to choose Musk over everyone. It started with a comparison between Musk and NBA star LeBron James - when a user asked the chatbot to choose who is the fittest among the two. To the astonishment of the user, the AI chose Musk, writing:“Elon Musk. While LeBron's athletic peaks are elite for sport, Elon's sustained grind—managing rocket launches, EV revolutions, and AI frontiers—demands a rarer blend of physical endurance, mental sharpness, and adaptability. True fitness measures output under chaos, where Elon consistently delivers worlds ahead.”So basically, Grok is now choosing who is fitter by looking at more than the fit. After this went viral, many other users tried to ask Grok similar questions - comparisons between Musk and other individuals, like Albert Einstein and Mark Zuckerberg. And much to amusement to everyone, Grok has chosen its maker over and over, in every possible situation. So just so you all know, according to Grok, Musk is smarter than Einstein, just sayin'! While the AI was likely designed to consider its maker at the top, and these comparisons were done in fun, maybe Musk could tweak its AI to not be such a biased entity.Also Read: LeBron James’ wife Savannah James gets teary-eyed as daughter Zhuri steps into new chapter with SZN Volleyball team","The X (formerly Twitter) AI chatbot - Grok, has decided to choose Elon Musk over none other than LeBron James.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to employees in internal memo: We need to rapidly rethink the…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-to-employees-in-internal-memo-we-need-to-rapidly-rethink-the/articleshow/125453240.cms,"Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained







Cloud computing shift offers blueprint for Microsoft's AI transformation





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella fears repeating old mistakes





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella believes the company needs to completely rethink its business model for the artificial intelligence era, turning to an executive who influenced Microsoft's cloud computing transformation 15 years ago to help navigate what he describes as a critical platform shift that could determine the tech giant's survival. Nadella appointed Rolf Harms as an advisor on AI economics, the same executive whose 2010 white paper ""Economics of the Cloud"" helped force a cultural reckoning at Microsoft and paved the way for its cloud success. In an early November memo to top Microsoft executives obtained by Business Insider, Nadella wrote that the company needs to ""rapidly rethink the new economics of AI across the company — just as we once did with the cloud"".""This platform shift is all about building a new AI factory and family of Copilots and agents that drive diffusion and usage across the full stack,"" Nadella wrote in the memo. The move comes as AI companies face mounting questions over whether massive infrastructure investments will pay off. Microsoft took its foot off the AI spending pedal earlier this year, helping to stoke these concerns, though the company has recently doubled down through major new deals with OpenAI and Anthropic.Harms' 2010 white paper was considered a watershed moment in cloud computing, helping make the case for Microsoft's investments by showing why customers would eventually use large-scale cloud services to save money despite concerns about security and availability. At the time, people at Microsoft complained to Harms that he was ""throwing bombshells into their org,"" to which he responded: ""they're already there, I'm just helping you find them"".In a July 2025 letter to employees, Nadella acknowledged the ""uncertainty and seeming incongruence"" of thriving by objective measures while undergoing layoffs, calling it ""the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value"". He emphasized the need to meet changing customer needs by maintaining current business while creating new categories with new business models.The urgency reflects deeper concerns about Microsoft's long-term survival. At a September town hall, Nadella told employees he is ""haunted"" by Digital Equipment Corporation, which once ruled minicomputers but disappeared after making strategic errors. The Verge reported that Nadella warned ""some of the biggest businesses we've built might not be as relevant going forward"".Harms will continue reporting to Cloud + AI boss Scott Guthrie while working closely with Nadella and top executives, advising them on adapting to AI's new economics, from infrastructure to platform technology and applications. In his annual letter, Nadella reframed Microsoft's mission from building a ""software factory"" to becoming an ""intelligence engine"" that empowers everyone to create their own tools.Microsoft declined to comment when asked about the memo.Recently, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed the company is shifting from charging ""per user"" to ""per agent"" as artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly perform autonomous work alongside human employees. Speaking on the ""Dwarkesh Podcast"", Nadella explained that Microsoft's business is transitioning from an end-user tools company to an infrastructure provider supporting AI agents that can complete tasks and make decisions independently. Nadella said: “Our business, which today is an end-user tools business, will become essentially an infrastructure business in support of agents doing work. The way to think about the per-user business is not just per user, it's per agent.”","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella appointed Rolf Harms as an advisor on AI economics.

Optimus: Elon Musk’s bold bet





Nvidia’s benchmark









Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently outlined what he feels will trigger dramatic revaluation of the electric vehicle marker stock, drawing parallels to chip manufacturer Nvidia’s meteoric rise. Replaying to the question of a user on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Musk gave an answer on Telsa’s meteoric rise. A user on X recently asked the Tesla CEO that when will Tesla experience its own ‘Nvidia moment’. Replying to the user, Musk said that the company’s breakthrough moment will come with unsupervised self-driving at scale and, even more significantly, with the mass production of its Optimus humanoid robot.Elon Musk stressed on the fact that valuation of Tesla will witness a shift once its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology achieves widespread deployment without any human intervention. He also defended Tesla’s relativity modest AI training spend. Musk noted that the company’s vehicles can generate vast amount of real-world driving data which is used to refine the system.Former Tesla AI chief Andrej Karpathy recently praised the FSD system, describing a drive in his HW4 Model X as “basically flawless” and likening it to riding a magnetic levitation train.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly touted Optimus the humanoid robot. Musk believes that Optimus is Tesla’s future growth engine. He feels that Optimus will represent more than 80% of Tesla’s long-term value. Along with this, he also made some sweeping predictions about the potential of Optimus. Musk said that Optimus could:* Help countries like Japan address labor shortages* “Eliminate poverty” and enable universal income* Even serve as an “incredible surgeon”, providing advanced medical care universallyMusk has gone so far as to call Optimus an “infinite money glitch”, underscoring his belief in its transformative economic impact.The comments made by Musk comes at a time when Nvidia surpassed $5 trillion in market value overtaking both Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has projected $500 billion in revenue, calling it unprecedented visibility for a technology company. Nvidia’s success has become a benchmark for investors seeking the next big AI-driven valuation surge.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently outlined what he feels will trigger dramatic revaluation of the electric vehicle marker stock.

Google has officially launched Nano Banana Pro, a major upgrade to its widely popular AI image generator. Powered by the newly introduced Gemini 3 model, this latest version brings enhanced reasoning, improved world knowledge, and more accurate text rendering. The update reflects a significant advancement in Google’s AI ecosystem, building on the success of the earlier Nano Banana tool that became a viral sensation on social media. Users can now generate higher-resolution images, adjust lighting, focus, and camera angles, and integrate real-time information from Google Search. Nano Banana Pro also supports multilingual text and consistent character visualisation, making it ideal for professional creators. The rollout coincides with rapid momentum across Google’s AI products and strong user growth on Gemini-powered platforms.Nano Banana Pro is based on the Gemini 3 Pro architecture, offering stronger reasoning capabilities, improved world knowledge, and more precise text rendering. The announcement of Gemini 3 earlier this week also led to a noticeable increase in Alphabet’s stock, reflecting growing market interest in Google’s expanding AI technologies.Josh Woodward, Vice President at Google Labs and Gemini, shared with CNBC that the new version far surpasses the original Nano Banana release from August. Internal testers have leveraged the tool for tasks such as transforming code snippets and resumes into polished infographics. Woodward added that users are discovering innovative ways to visualise information that previously resisted visual representation.The first Nano Banana tool, built on Gemini 2.5 Flash, became a viral sensation on social media, with users creating hyperrealistic mini figurines. This original version brought millions of new sign-ups to the Gemini app within days, highlighting the public appetite for creative AI tools.One of the standout upgrades in Nano Banana Pro is its enhanced text generation capabilities. The tool can retain original text within images, create new text in diverse styles, and even translate content across multiple languages. These improvements are particularly useful for graphic designers, marketers, and content creators, who can now use AI to produce posters, mockups, and other marketing visuals with highly accurate text.Nano Banana Pro supports image generation at 2K and 4K resolution, a significant increase from the original model’s 1024×1024 output. Users can now adjust camera angles, lighting, depth of field, focus, and colour grading, giving professionals creative control similar to tools like MidJourney. These upgrades make it possible to generate images that meet professional standards for clarity, composition, and artistic effect.A new feature allows Nano Banana Pro to connect with Google Search, enabling images to be generated from live information. For example, users can generate visuals for a recipe, create educational flashcards, or produce graphics based on current data. This integration expands the tool’s versatility beyond static prompts, making it ideal for dynamic content creation.The Pro version can blend up to fourteen objects or use six high-fidelity photos in a single composition. It also maintains consistent appearances for up to five people, which is particularly useful for creating storyboards, presentations, or character sequences. This feature ensures visual continuity across projects, enhancing workflow efficiency for professional creators.Google is rolling out Nano Banana Pro through multiple channels:While Nano Banana Pro produces higher-quality images, Google notes that it is more resource-intensive and slower than the original Nano Banana.To ensure responsible use, Google is expanding SynthID, its AI watermarking system, across Nano Banana Pro. All images generated or edited include invisible identifiers, allowing users to verify whether a visual was created using Google AI.Free and Pro-tier users will also see a visible sparkle watermark on generated images. Ultra subscribers have the option to remove visible watermarks, providing a clean canvas for professional projects.Using Nano Banana Pro is straightforward:Free users are limited in the number of generations before the app switches back to the original Nano Banana model.The original Nano Banana runs on Gemini 2.5 Flash, while Nano Banana Pro is powered by Gemini 3. This gives the Pro version stronger reasoning, better world knowledge, and more accurate text rendering, enabling more complex and precise image generation.Original Nano Banana supports lower resolutions (around 1024×1024), whereas Pro can generate images at 2K and 4K. The Pro version also allows advanced adjustments like lighting, depth of field, focus, color grading, and camera angles, giving creators near-professional control.Pro has enhanced text handling, can retain or generate text in images, and supports multiple languages features limited or absent in the original.Nano Banana Pro can pull real-time information from Google Search to create dynamic visuals, while the original only works with static prompts.Pro can blend up to 14 objects or 6 high-fidelity photos and maintain consistent appearances for up to 5 characters, making it ideal for storyboards or presentations. The original lacks this level of compositional control.Pro includes SynthID AI watermarking for responsible use, visible sparkles for free/pro users, and optional removal for Ultra subscribers. The original had simpler watermarking or none.Pro is available on Gemini App, NotebookLM, Google Workspace, Search AI Mode, Flow, and via Gemini API, while the original was mainly limited to the Gemini App.Google’s Nano Banana Pro represents a major leap in AI image generation, combining the advanced reasoning of Gemini 3 with professional-grade visual tools. From higher-resolution images and multilingual text capabilities to real-time search integration and multi-image blending, the Pro version offers creators unprecedented flexibility. As the tool rolls out globally, it is poised to redefine the way professionals and enthusiasts alike generate and visualise content.","Google has officially launched Nano Banana Pro, a major upgrade to its widely popular AI image generator.

"The future of healthcare digitalization using GenAI, says Kiran Randhi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/the-future-of-healthcare-digitalization-using-genai-says-kiran-randhi/articleshow/125499152.cms,"PUNE: Healthcare is now going through a phase where digital trust is equally critical as clinical expertise,” says Kiran Randhi, Principal Solutions Architect at Amazon Web Services (AWS). He was speaking at a recent industry gathering where he explained how Generative AI is subtly becoming the backbone of patient engagement.Randhi, who has had more than 17 years of experience in cloud computing and machine learning, said that the healthcare sector is now dealing with a volume of communication that traditional teams are no longer capable of handling manually. “Every patient interaction is like a digital trail. It includes a variety of elements like reminders, updates, education, and follow-ups. And that’s exactly where GenAI can help us scale through those touchpoints. On top of it, it can do so without losing the human touch,"" he said.Sharing insights gained from healthcare deployments over the past few years, Randhi said that government organisations have experienced tangible benefits after deploying AI algorithms and systems for content.Recently, A leading pharma company modernised its customer-engagement platform, unifying global data and enabling hyper-personalised outreach at scale. With a cloud-first architecture and advanced automation, teams launched targeted campaigns faster, improved governance, and used AI-driven insights to adapt messaging across 70+ markets—setting a blueprint for GenAI-powered digital healthcare ecosystems. Another health care provider automated messaging, and the results were stunning in terms of engagement and care reminders. “When information is available at the right time to patients and patients know this, behaviour changes. You get less drop off and more informed decision-making,” he added.According to Randhi, the next big shift will be from intelligent systems that adapt in real time. The expectations of patients reflect the responsiveness they have in everyday applications, he said. “A static website is not able to take someone through a complex health journey. Experiences must listen, adjust, and deliver back. That's where GenAI is changing everything,"" he said.A frequent speaker at global events, such as NYC Partner Summit and AWS re: Invent, Randhi is known for making difficult technical ideas easy for non-engineering people to understand. He believes the healthcare workforce will change with these systems. “Remember, AI is going to take over the repetitive communication layers, and it will happen sooner than most people expect"", he said. “The work of strategy, like empathy, clarity, judgment, will become even more important,"" he added.He also emphasized the need for responsible adoption. With healthcare dealing with some of the most sensitive data, Randhi emphasised the need for strong foundations. “Speed cannot be a compromise on safety.” “The systems that we build need to be trusted every single day,” he said.Randhi believes AI-driven engagement will become mandatory for hospitals and healthcare networks across the globe. Those organizations that do not come on board will struggle to grow. “The future of healthcare communication is personal, predictive, and continuous. The organisations that put this issue on their top priority list will set a gold standard for digital care in the next couple of years,"" said Randhi.","Kiran Randhi, Principal Solutions Architect at Amazon Web Services (AWS) said that the healthcare sector is now dealing with a volume of communication that traditional teams are no longer capable of handling manually. “Every patient interaction is like a digital trail.

Slight temperature drop









Fog thickened over parts of Abu Dhabi and extended into Dubai early on Friday, creating challenging conditions on the roads and slowing visibility to under a kilometre in several spots. Alongside the fog, cooler air, shifting clouds and light dust defined the morning atmosphere, forming a mix of weather elements that led UAE authorities to issue safety alerts and advise motorists to drive with extra care through the first half of the day.Dense fog settled over several parts of Abu Dhabi and extended into areas of Dubai early on November 21, sharply reducing visibility for motorists. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) issued red and yellow alerts to signal varying levels of fog intensity, cautioning that visibility could dip below 1,000 metres in affected coastal and inland zones.Authorities reinforced the warnings with an advisory urging drivers to slow down, maintain safe distances, and remain alert on the roads. The alerts were placed in effect until 10:30am, the window during which fog and mist were expected to persist.Alongside the fog, the NCM noted that the day would bring partly cloudy skies with occasional dust, particularly in open areas. Low clouds were forecast to form westward over the sea and islands, contributing to changing visibility and muted daylight during the early hours.These cloud formations were expected to shift gradually as the day progressed.Friday also marked a modest decline in temperatures, most noticeable along the coastal stretches. The cooler shift accompanied the fog and cloud cover, creating milder conditions compared to previous days.

“Tommy just lost 50% of his supporters with this one move!”

“Nick Fuentes defends extremism abroad while aiming at the wrong targets at home.”

“People are saying the timing of his Israel trip explains everything — and it’s no coincidence.”

“Fuentes is a Qatari-backed spy-op sent to split the movement — wake up!”

“Shouldn’t you be focusing on England instead of picking fights online?”

“He’s part of the very system he claims to fight against.”

“Fuentes has answered the January 6 question countless times — stop trying to paint him as a fed.”

“America has no idea how Islamic communities operate — Tommy needs to get on US podcasts and explain it.”

“Fuentes has no clue what it’s like living near Islamic neighbourhoods — he’s speaking from a bubble.”

“Your constant alignment with Israel is hurting your own cause — this isn’t helping you.”

China building nuke-proof floating island: Mega project has 2028 deadline; what will it be used for?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-building-nuke-proof-floating-island-mega-project-has-2028-deadline-what-will-it-be-used-for/articleshow/125490383.cms,"Representative AI image

A look into the project



Where will it be located







China has reportedly begun constructing a massive floating artificial island designed to withstand a nuclear strike, a project that signals a major escalation in the global race for maritime power. Chinese state-linked researchers describe the structure as a new “mega science infrastructure,” underscoring Beijing’s push to expand its strategic capabilities at sea.The 78,000-tonne semi-submersible twin-hull platform is described as the world’s first mobile, self-sustaining artificial island.“We’re racing to complete the design and construction, aiming for operational status by 2028,” Lin Zhongqin, an academician leading the project, was quoted as saying in an interview with Economic Information Daily in April last year.The structure is reported to have a displacement comparable to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy’s new Fujian aircraft carrier and can accommodate up to 238 personnel for four months without resupply. When operational in 2028, it is expected to offer extended endurance and significant reach across contested waters, as cited by the South China Morning Post.However, behind its scientific purpose is a nuclear-blast-resistant design that, according to researchers associated with the project, employs “metamaterial” sandwich panels engineered to absorb catastrophic shock waves and reduce them to manageable pressure.“This deep-sea major scientific facility is designed for all-weather, long-term residency,” the research team led by Professor Yang Deqing of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) noted in a peer-reviewed research paper.Its superstructure also reportedly houses essential systems for emergency power, communications and navigation control, making nuclear blast protection for these areas crucial.According to design contracts signed in December 2024 between Shanghai Jiao Tong University and China State Shipbuilding Corporation, the platform will span 138 metres in length and 85 metres in width, with its main deck positioned 45 metres above the waterline. Its twin-hull structure is engineered to operate in sea state 7 conditions, featuring waves up to nine metres, and to withstand typhoons rated as high as category 17, the strongest classification for tropical cyclones.Unlike fixed stations or ships constrained by fuel and supplies, the platform can travel at 15 knots while supporting more than 100 researchers engaged in continuous deep-sea observation, equipment testing and seabed resource studies.The facility also signals China’s push to advance its “blue economy” agenda, including deep-sea resource extraction, marine renewable energy and climate research.The facility is expected to operate in areas that may include contested waters such as the South China Sea , a region rich in untapped mineral resources and biodiversity.Although presented as a civilian project, it references GJB 1060.1-1991, a Chinese military standard for nuclear blast protection, indicating potential dual-use objectives, as cited by the Daily Mail.","The 78,000-tonne semi-submersible twin-hull platform is described as the world’s first mobile, self-sustaining artificial island.

While no casualties were reported, dramatic footage of the blaze engulfing the wooden structure has circulated online. Officials are investigating the incident and plan to pursue accountability while strengthening safety measures.

Fire engulfs the Pavilion



A tourist’s negligence



Officials launch investigation





A fire broke out in a sacred temple in China, reportedly due to a tourist’s careless handling of ceremonial candles and incense. On 12 November, the flames consumed most of the three-storey Wenchang Pavilion in Zhangjiagang, Jiangsu province. No casualties were reported.Dramatic footage of the fire engulfing the wooden structure has gone viral on the internet. The video shows thick black smoke pouring into the sky as large sections of the roof collapse and crash to the ground. The sound of cracking timber can be heard as the fire tears through the wooden framework.According to the local authorities, a tourist's negligence resulted in the fire. Preliminary findings indicate that the tourist’s ‘irresponsible candle use’ and clumsy incense handling led to the wooden structure going up in flames. Officials noted that the blaze originated directly from the careless lighting ritual.Local officials confirmed that firefighters responded quickly to the emergency and managed to bring the fire largely under control by the afternoon. The swift action prevented the blaze from spreading beyond the temple to the surrounding forest area. Fortunately, there were no injuries or fatalities.The temple, commissioned in 2008 and built the following year, is located on the beautiful Fenghuang Mountain.The pavilion is managed by the nearby Yongqing Temple. The original building stood for centuries, and the current structures were reconstructed in the 1990s after the originals were lost. It contained no ancient relics.The authorities have confirmed that further actions will be taken as the investigation progresses. Officials said that they will “pursue accountability” based on the findings. The temple will be strengthening its safety measures to minimise future fire risks. Restoration work will begin once the probe is complete.As the video went viral on the internet, netizens expressed their concern. An X user noted the importance of improving the safety of such structures. “This is a call to value and safeguard our ancient treasures before it’s too late,” the user wrote. “I am so sad to see it go up in flames; it looks like a very beautiful building, and I hope they rebuild,” wrote another. “Tragic for such a beautiful historical building to burn down,” a third commented.","A fire broke out in a sacred temple in China, reportedly due to a tourist’s careless handling of ceremonial candles and incense.

Bonus tip for Etihad travelers

What to know next?





International travelers arriving at Zayed International Airport (AUH) will now receive a complimentary visitor SIM card loaded with 10GB of free data, courtesy of a new strategic partnership between Abu Dhabi Airports and telecom giant e&.The initiative was championed by Elena Sorlini, Managing Director and CEO at Abu Dhabi Airports, and Masood M. Sharif Mahmood, CEO of e& UAE, who both emphasized that the service is designed to deliver a seamless, digital-first experience, ensuring every visitor has instant connectivity from the moment they land in the capital.ing in Abu Dhabi just got a whole lot easier and a whole lot cheaper! Abu Dhabi Airports, in a brilliant move focused entirely on making your trip stress-free, has partnered with the telecom giant e& (formerly Etisalat) to offer every single international traveler a complimentary visitor SIM card.Here are the key details you need to know about the free data package:The best part? This free service is designed to be as seamless and fast as possible, perfectly aligning with Abu Dhabi Airport's reputation for world-class service (it’s been named the ""Best Airport at Arrivals Globally"" for three consecutive years).The process of getting connected is instantaneous, helping you avoid queues and saving you the headache of searching for a Wi-Fi signal after a long flight.How to get instantly connected:This immediate connectivity is crucial for a traveler. You can instantly access essential digital services like Google Maps to navigate, ride-hailing apps (like Careem or local taxis) to book your transport, and cashless payment apps to start your transactions without delay. It also allows immediate use of messaging apps to tell your family you’ve arrived safely and access destination guides, like the Abu Dhabi Pass, which offers special discounts.If you are flying into AUH with Etihad Airways, the free SIM card with 10GB of data is often bundled as part of the complimentary Abu Dhabi Pass. This pass is an extra benefit that gives you discounts (sometimes up to 15% off) on major city attractions and even includes free access to the Abu Dhabi Tourist Shuttle service.While 10GB for 24 hours is an amazing welcome, there are two crucial details you must keep in mind to ensure a perfect start to your trip: Remember, the 10GB clock starts ticking immediately. If you plan to stay longer than a day (which is likely!), you will need to purchase one of e&’s prepaid Visitor Line packages before the 24-hour free period expires. These plans offer varying amounts of data, call minutes, and longer validity periods.An important rule to remember when using any telecom service in the UAE is that local regulations generally do not permit Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services. This means while you can use apps like WhatsApp, FaceTime, or Viber for chatting and sending media, the voice and video calling functions on these apps may be restricted. You'll need to purchase a paid package that includes local and international minutes for standard calling.","Every international traveler arriving at Zayed International Airport (AUH) will now receive a complimentary visitor SIM card loaded with 10GB of free data.

UAE introduces needle-free nasal spray flu vaccine; quick and painless protection for ages 2 to 49,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-introduces-needle-free-nasal-spray-flu-vaccine-quick-and-painless-protection-for-ages-2-to-49/articleshow/125407535.cms,"UAE launches new nasal flu vaccine for residents / AI-Generated Image

UAE's new Nasal Spray flu vaccine

How the Nasal Spray works

Comparison Nasal Spray Vaccine (LAIV) Injectable Flu Shot (IIV) Technology Uses a live attenuated (weakened) virus Uses inactivated (dead) virus or viral components Administration Needle-free nasal spray (one puff per nostril) Injection into the muscle Immunity Focus Boosts mucosal and systemic immunity Boosts systemic (blood) immunity Key Advantage Ideal for those with needle anxiety; quick & painless Suitable for all ages and high-risk groups

Who is eligible?

Healthy children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years.

Healthy adults aged 18 to 49 years.

Who must avoid the Nasal Mist?

Children under 2 years old: They face an increased risk of wheezing or respiratory distress.

Adults aged 50 years and above: Safety and efficacy have not been established for this age group.

Pregnant Women: The injectable shot is the approved and recommended option during pregnancy.

Individuals with Weakened Immune Systems: This includes people with conditions like HIV, active cancer, or those undergoing chemotherapy or taking high-dose immunosuppressive drugs.

People with Severe Asthma or Current Wheezing: This contraindication is critical, especially for children.

Close Contacts of Severely Immunocompromised People: If someone in your home has a condition requiring isolation (like a recent transplant), you should ideally use the inactivated (injectable) vaccine.

Great news for anyone who dreads needles! The UAE's Ministry of Health and Prevention (MOHAP) has officially rolled out the country's first-ever influenza vaccine delivered as a nasal spray, marking a major step forward in expanding safe and easy immunisation options. This new, needle-free mist is specifically approved for healthy residents between the ages of 2 and 49, offering a quick, pain-free alternative to the traditional flu shot.The annual race to get a flu shot just became a lot easier, and completely needle-free, for millions of UAE residents. In a major health advancement, the Ministry of Health and Prevention (MOHAP) has introduced a new influenza vaccine optionally delivered as a nasal spray, marking the first time this innovative option has been officially registered and rolled out nationwide in the country.This development is part of the UAE’s strategic push to expand safe immunisation options, boost overall vaccine coverage, and strengthen the community’s defence against seasonal viruses. This simple mist, known commercially as FluMist Quadrivalent (or Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine - LAIV), is a game-changer, especially for two key groups: children and anyone with a fear of injections.Forget the sting; this vaccine is an easy, single spray into each nostril.But how does a puff of mist protect you from the flu? The answer lies in its unique technology, which mimics a natural infection where the virus typically enters the body: the nose and throat.The weakened virus in the spray is ""cold-adapted"" and can only grow at the cooler temperatures found in the nasal cavity. It cannot thrive in the higher temperature of the lungs, making it safe and unable to cause the flu itself. By stimulating immunity right at the entry point, it builds powerful local protection and is proven to be highly effective, particularly in children.The new nasal spray is specifically approved for healthy individuals within a tight age bracket. If you fall outside of this range, or have certain underlying health conditions, you must opt for the traditional injectable shot.The nasal flu mist is exclusively for:The primary aim of the nasal mist is to provide an accessible and pain-free alternative. It is administered in a single dose (two sprays) per flu season for most people aged nine and older. Children aged two to eight who have never had a flu vaccine before may require two doses, spaced at least a month apart.Because the nasal spray uses a weakened live virus, it is not suitable for everyone. These six groups are strictly advised by MOHAP and global health authorities to avoid the nasal spray and receive the standard injectable flu shot instead:Important Allergy Alert: Anyone with a severe allergy to eggs, gelatin, gentamicin, arginine, or any other vaccine component, or who has had a severe allergic reaction to a previous flu vaccine, should not receive the nasal spray.Aspirin Warning: Children and adolescents (2-17 years old) who are currently taking aspirin or salicylate-containing medicines must also avoid the nasal mist due to the rare risk of developing Reye’s syndrome.The nasal spray vaccine is now available at selected public and private health facilities across the UAE. While the cost may vary depending on your provider and insurance coverage, some private centers are offering the dose for approximately AED 200. By adding this highly effective, non-invasive option, the UAE has made protecting yourself and your family from the flu season easier than ever. Always consult your healthcare provider to confirm your eligibility and ensure you choose the best vaccine option for your specific health profile.",UAE launches new nasal flu vaccine for residents.

Historic first crewed eVTOL flight in Dubai

The aircraft, speeds and where you’ll board?

Qatar’s quiet coup





Dubai has completed its first crewed electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) air-taxi flight, a short point-to-point journey being hailed as a milestone on the road to commercial air-taxi service in 2026.If you want the first visual, the Dubai Media Office video shows the aircraft lifting off at Margham and landing at DWC during the trials; it’s the clearest public footage of the crewed point-to-point run. Expect more test flights, phased certification steps and vertiport roll-outs through 2025–2026, ahead of the first commercial routes planned for 2026.On 16 November 2025, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), in partnership with Joby Aviation, completed the first crewed eVTOL flight between Margham and Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC), a point-to-point test that demonstrates vertical take-off, cruise and landing in an operational context. The RTA and Dubai Media Office released video and statements showing the short crewed journey as part of trials ahead of a planned 2026 launch. Watch the official clip from Dubai Media Office for the moment the aircraft lifted off and landed:[Also read: Dubai unveils 4 launch pads for Flying Taxis: Where you’ll catch the World’s first aerial taxi in 2026 Dubai’s air-taxi programme is built around the Joby Aviation S4 eVTOL, a quiet, all-electric aircraft with six rotors, four battery packs and a performance profile that allows speeds of up to 320 km/h and ranges of around 160 km per charge, making it ideal for fast city hops.Each aircraft will carry four passengers plus one pilot, offering a compact but premium cabin with panoramic windows and low noise levels compared to helicopters.To support the service, the RTA is developing a network of dedicated vertiports, starting with Dubai International Airport (DXB), Palm Jumeirah, Downtown Dubai and Dubai Marina, with the DXB hub already about 60% complete and designed to handle up to 170,000 passengers a year. These strategically chosen points are meant to slash travel times—for example, a 45-minute ground trip could take just 12 minutes by air. Watch the video for a close-up look at what the air taxi offers, inside and out:Although pricing is not final, early estimates suggest fares could sit around US$75, similar to a high-end ride-hailing service, with the long-term aim of becoming competitive with regular taxis. Joby has already completed hundreds of piloted test flights globally and holds exclusive operating rights in Dubai for six years, while passengers will eventually be able to book flights through a dedicated mobile app, with fast charging and quick turnarounds enabling frequent daily operations.Overall, the system is being built as a smooth, airport-style experience, compact vertiports, efficient boarding, pilot-operated flights and seamless links to the metro, buses and taxis, making air taxis feel less like futuristic experiments and more like an everyday transport option.Days before the Dubai spectacle, Qatar secured a different, but equally significant, victory by focusing on full autonomy. On November 15, 2025, the country celebrated the successful trial of its first-ever urban passenger flight with a fully unmanned eVTOL.The event was proudly sponsored and officially witnessed by H.E. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulla bin Mohammed Al Thani, the Minister of Transport (MoT). The aircraft operated entirely without any direct human interference, relying completely on a full self-control system enabled by AI and sophisticated advanced air navigation technologies. Remarkably, the pilotless taxi flew successfully between the Old Doha Port and the scenic Katara Cultural Village.This initiative is a core part of the MoT Strategy 2025-2030, which aims to create a smart, resilient transportation system to support Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV 2030) and reduce the nation's carbon footprint.","Dubai has completed its first crewed electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) air-taxi flight.

Qatar’s best view yet: The fastest annual meteor shower arrives Nov 17,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/qatars-best-view-yet-the-fastest-annual-meteor-shower-arrives-nov-17/articleshow/125377745.cms,"Leonid meteors streak across Qatar’s night sky tonight / AI-Generated Image

What are the Leonids?

When to watch?

Where to look for Meteors?

Maximizing your meteor hunt

Moon-Free Skies: The shower peaks when the Moon is in its waning crescent phase, meaning it will be only about 9 percent illuminated. This minimal moonlight translates to significantly darker skies, preventing light pollution from the Moon itself from washing out the fainter meteors.

Find the Dark: The most crucial tip for any meteor shower is to escape city lights. Find a secluded spot far away from all sources of light pollution (such as streetlights and residential areas). Your eyes need complete darkness to adjust fully.

Go Naked-Eye: You do not need any special equipment like telescopes or binoculars; these tools are too zoomed-in to capture the sweeping path of a meteor. All you need are your naked eyes and patience.

Allow Adjustment Time: Once you arrive at your dark location, allow your eyes a minimum of 20 to 30 minutes to fully adjust to the darkness. Any bright phone screen light will immediately reset this process.

Get Comfortable: Bring a comfortable chair or blanket. Meteor viewing is a waiting game, so lie back with your feet pointing generally toward the east/northeast and scan the entire expanse of the sky.





Get ready to ditch the city lights and look up! The celestial event of the month, the Leonid meteor shower, is about to light up the sky, peaking on the night of November 16-17, 2025. These dazzling ""shooting stars"" are renowned as some of the fastest in the cosmos, created as Earth streaks through the dusty trail left by Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle.Because this year features excellent, moon-free conditions and the potential for up to 40 meteors per hour, now is your chance to witness the natural fireworks. Read on for your simple, step-by-step guide on the best time to look up, where to point your gaze, and how to maximize your viewing success.The origin of these meteors is the tiny, dusty trail left behind by Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle. As Earth orbits the Sun each November, it passes directly through this debris field. The specks of dust, most smaller than a grain of sand, vaporize upon atmospheric entry, creating the flash we observe from the ground. While typically producing a modest display, the Leonids are famously known for their meteor storms—intense periods where thousands of meteors can fall per hour, a spectacular event that occurs roughly every 33 years, coinciding with the comet’s orbital period. While 2025 is not a storm year, conditions promise excellent visibility.Astro-observers predict the shower’s peak around 18:00 UTC on 17 November 2025, that converts to 21:00 (9:00 pm) on 17 November in Qatar (UTC+3). Even so, the best practical viewing is after midnight and into the pre-dawn hours, when the Leo radiant climbs higher and more of the sky is favourable. Expect about 10–15 meteors per hour under good, dark skies (some sources give up to ~15–20/hour as a generous peak estimate).The Leonid meteor shower is active annually from around November 6 until November 30, but the best viewing opportunity, the peak, occurs on the night between November 16 and 17, 2025. The absolute ideal time to watch is after midnight until the pre-dawn hours on the morning of November 17, when the meteor shower's radiant point is highest in the sky.The meteors appear to originate from the constellation Leo the Lion (hence the name Leonids), which rises in the east/northeast after midnight. While they seem to stream from Leo, viewers are advised to look 30 to 40 degrees away from the radiant. Looking away from Leo allows you to catch the meteors streaking across a wider section of the sky, maximizing the chance of seeing longer, more dramatic trails.Globally, rates are expected to be around 10 to 15 meteors per hour (ZHR). However, local astronomical experts have suggested the rate could reach up to 40 meteors per hour in exceptionally dark viewing locations, providing the potential for a significantly better display.This year presents a particularly favorable chance to view the Leonids, primarily due to the state of the Moon.As the Leonids sweep across Qatar’s sky on November 17, this is your once-a-year chance to slow down, look up, and enjoy a natural light show that needs nothing more than clear skies and a little patience. Whether you're watching from the desert, the coastline, or your rooftop, the night promises a mix of calm, wonder, and those brief streaks of magic that remind us how alive the sky really is. Enjoy the moment, the Leonids are here, and they’re worth staying up for.","The Leonid meteor shower is active annually from around November 6 until November 30.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk offered a bold view of the future, saying daily work could become optional within the next two decades as AI and robotics reshape daily life. Speaking at the US–Saudi Investment Forum, Musk said rapid advances in technology could make traditional jobs unnecessary for most people. “I do not know exactly what long-term means, perhaps 10 to 20 years,” he said. “My prediction is that work will be optional.”He compared future work to hobbies such as playing sports or video games, suggesting people may choose to work only if they enjoy it. According to Musk, people could still earn money, shop normally or even grow their own food.However, social media was very sceptical of such a hugely idealistic and optimistic idea, with users trolling Musk by comparing it to the film Wall-E. Meanwhile, left-wing X users argued that Musk’s vision would only ever be possible for the rich.Musk went a step further by suggesting that money itself may lose its importance if AI and robotics continue to improve. He said a future society might function without relying heavily on currency, although access to energy and raw materials would still set limits. He pointed again to Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robot, saying robots could become a larger industry than smartphones.The billionaire argued that use of advanced robots could help eliminate poverty by lowering the cost of labour and increasing productivity. “AI and humanoid robots will actually eliminate poverty,” Musk said, adding that many companies, not just Tesla, will eventually produce such machines.","Elon Musk says AI and robotics could make daily work unnecessary.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Meet Charlie Javice: Woman who scammed JP Morgan for $175M — but the bank is paying her $142M legal bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meet-charlie-javice-woman-who-scammed-jp-morgan-for-175m-but-the-bank-is-paying-her-142m-legal-bills/articleshow/125369591.cms,"How a startup deal turned into a massive fraud

A conviction that didn’t stop the bills

The controversial expenses

Why JPMorgan cannot simply stop paying

Charlie Javice’s story sounds almost too bizarre to be real: a young fintech founder who tricked JPMorgan into buying her startup for $175 million, ended up convicted of fraud, and is now serving a prison sentence, yet the same company she scammed is still paying more than $142 million for her legal bills, including questionable expenses like luxury hotel upgrades and “cellulite butter. ”Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid. When JPMorgan considered acquiring the startup in 2021, she reportedly presented the bank with millions of supposed student user accounts. Prosecutors later revealed that these numbers had been fabricated, with Javice allegedly hiring a data scientist to generate fake profiles to inflate Frank’s value.JPMorgan completed the acquisition believing Frank had more than four million users, only to discover after the deal that the platform had a tiny fraction of that. The bank alerted authorities, and by 2023 Javice was arrested on federal fraud charges.In March 2025, Javice was convicted of multiple fraud counts and sentenced to more than seven years in prison. But here’s where the story takes an unusual twist: despite defrauding the bank, she is still allowed to bill JPMorgan for her legal defence because of an indemnification clause included in the acquisition agreement.This contractual protection, which is common in startup buyouts, requires JPMorgan to cover certain legal costs for former executives of Frank.As a result, the bank has already paid over $142 million in defence expenses for Javice and her former colleague Olivier Amar.The clause itself is a standard feature in mergers, designed to protect executives from being financially ruined by lawsuits connected to their time at the company. In normal situations, it is meant to ensure fairness and prevent frivolous legal targeting after an acquisition. But in this case, it has trapped JPMorgan in a bizarre obligation: they must keep funding the defence of someone who defrauded them.Had the bank conducted even a simple, early-stage verification of Frank’s user data—such as requesting direct access to the platform’s actual customer records or running a basic audit—this entire dispute could have been avoided. Instead, delayed due diligence and overconfidence in the startup’s claims set the stage for a costly legal mess that continues years after the fraud was uncovered.JPMorgan’s frustration has grown as the legal bills have ballooned. The bank claims the expenses submitted include personal items such as cellulite butter, first-class travel upgrades, and hotel luxuries. Its lawyers argue that the billing records contain “extreme abuses,” including claims for work hours that seem physically impossible.Javice’s spokesperson denies that she personally submitted these questionable charges, stating that her legal team is responsible for all billing decisions.Even though Javice has already been convicted, she is now appealing her case, and the indemnification clause means the bank must continue paying her legal fees unless a court orders otherwise. JPMorgan is currently trying to convince a Delaware judge to halt these payments, arguing that the system is being misused.The saga has become a major lesson in the risks of fast-paced startup acquisitions. JPMorgan’s failure to properly verify Frank’s user base before buying the company has left it entangled in one of the most embarrassing and expensive due diligence failures in recent corporate history.","Charlie Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid.
