"Shannon Sharpe Lawsuit: Inside the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit: A full timeline of the sexual assault case, lawyers, leaked videos, and what comes next",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/inside-the-shannon-sharpe-lawsuit-a-full-timeline-of-the-sexual-assault-case-lawyers-leaked-videos-and-what-comes-next/articleshow/120550094.cms,"Chris Pizzello—AP Photo

Shannon Sharpe is being sued for sexual assault and emotional abuse by a woman he allegedly dated for nearly two years



The woman is being represented by Tony Buzbee, while Shannon Sharpe has tapped a high-profile crisis lawyer to lead his defense



Leaked videos, Instagram Live accidents, and conflicting audio clips are all in play as both sides fight for the narrative



Here's a full timeline of how the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit unfolded and where things stand now



2023: Sharpe and the plaintiff allegedly begin their relationship. She was 20 years old at the time. The lawsuit says the abuse started within this period.





Sept 2024: That infamous Instagram Live stream happens. Sharpe accidentally plays audio of himself in a sexual act. He first denies involvement, then later owns up and apologizes publicly.





Early 2025: Settlement talks reportedly take place. According to Sharpe’s lawyers, the plaintiff rejected a $10 million offer, opting instead to sue.





April 18, 2025: The civil lawsuit is officially filed in Nevada court. It includes claims of rape, battery, emotional distress, and unauthorized filming.





April 21–22, 2025: Sharpe fires back, denying all allegations and calling the suit a “shakedown.” Texts and other materials are leaked to the press by both sides.





April 23, 2025 (Current): The case is ongoing. No criminal charges have been filed, but the civil lawsuit is progressing. Media outlets, fans, and legal analysts are watching closely as the court weighs what’s real and what’s rumor.





It’s been a chaotic few weeks in sports media, and at the center of it all is NFL Hall of Famer and ESPN host Shannon Sharpe. What started as whispers around an accidental Instagram Live has escalated into a serious civil lawsuit involving sexual assault allegations , leaked videos, and a public legal back-and-forth. If you’ve been confused trying to piece it all together, don’t worry, we’ve got you.Here’s the full breakdown of what’s going on with the Shannon Sharpe case, when it started, what evidence is out there, who’s involved, and where it’s headed.In April 2025, a woman filed a civil lawsuit in Nevada against Shannon Sharpe, accusing him of sexual assault, battery, emotional distress, and the non-consensual recording and distribution of intimate videos. She’s seeking over $50 million in damages. The lawsuit claims the two were in a relationship from 2023 to 2024, starting when she was 20 years old. According to her, what seemed consensual at first turned into a pattern of coercion, abuse, and surveillance.Sharpe, on the other hand, is denying everything. His legal team says the relationship was entirely consensual and involved role-playing. They’ve painted the lawsuit as a “cash grab,” revealing that the plaintiff allegedly turned down a $10 million settlement offer before filing. So now, it's a civil war with two very different stories being told.If the name Tony Buzbee rings a bell, that’s because he’s represented some very famous (and very controversial) figures before like Deshaun Watson and Sean ""Diddy"" Combs. Known for taking on high-profile sexual misconduct cases, Buzbee is the one filing the lawsuit on behalf of “Jane Doe.”On the other side, Shannon Sharpe has hired Lanny J. Davis , a seasoned crisis lawyer with ties to Washington, D.C. Davis has made it clear they’re not just defending against the lawsuit, they’re preparing to countersue for defamation. So buckle up, this isn’t going away quietly.One of the wildest parts of this whole case? The video evidence. Buzbee claims there’s a 10-minute clip that is “incredibly damning,” though only about 30 seconds of it have been referenced publicly so far. Sharpe’s team is calling the footage misleading and demanding that the entire video be released.On top of that, there’s an audio recording where a man believed to be Sharpe is heard making what some interpreted as threatening comments. Again, Sharpe’s side says it was part of a consensual argument taken out of context.And let’s not forget the Instagram Live incident , this might’ve kicked everything into motion. In September 2024, Sharpe accidentally broadcasted audio of a sexual encounter on IG Live. At first, he blamed hackers. Later, he admitted it was just a slip-up. That incident reportedly embarrassed the plaintiff and contributed to the breakdown of their relationship.Shannon Sharpe hasn’t been criminally charged yet but that hasn’t stopped the court of public opinion from weighing in. Some fans believe he’s being unfairly targeted because of his fame, while others say the video and audio evidence (even if partial) are enough to raise serious red flags. The fact that this is a civil case means we’re unlikely to see jail time even if he loses, but reputational damage? That’s already underway.Also read - Shannon Sharpe sued for sexual assault yet ESPN’s 'First Take' will go on like nothing happened","Shannon Sharpe is being sued for sexual assault and emotional abuse by a woman he allegedly dated for nearly two years.

Is Trump taking Ozempic? Conspiracy theories swirl while mystery skin patch reappears on his hand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-trump-taking-ozempic-conspiracy-theories-swirl-while-mystery-skin-patch-reappears-on-his-hand/articleshow/120562463.cms,"Donald Trump's weight loss triggers speculations over Ozempic while the mystery greenish patch on his right hand reappears.

But what is the mysterious bruise?



Donald Trump's annual physical results have declared that he is in excellent health at the age of 78. His resting heart rate was recorded at 62 beats per minute and it was revealed that he takes two medicines for cholesterol control. His fitness was attributed to his active lifestyle as he has been regularly playing golf and winning -- even after becoming the president, his height was recorded as 75 inches (6 feet 2 inches) and his weight was 224 pounds (102 kg).Trump lost 20 pounds since his last presidential physical test in 2020 and the whispers are that a little pharmaceutical help was taken, Daily Beast reported. Elon Musk has been open about taking GLP-1 drugs to shed a few extra pounds but it will remain a secret whether Trump too used them. “Nothing would do more to improve the health, lifespan and quality of life for Americans than making GLP inhibitors super low cost to the public,” he posted on X. GLP-1 receptor agonists are used to treat diabetes and obesity, and include Ozempic and Wegovy.Dr Lisa Oldson, an obesity medicine specialist, told The Daily Beast she is doubtful a diet change alone could account for Trump’s distinctly slimmer look. “Most people don’t lose [weight] that fast without meds,” she said. “When we look at people losing 30 pounds, 40 pounds, 50 pounds, 80 pounds, 100 pounds,” Oldson said, “that’s much more often due to the newer meds, the GLP agonists,” and not because of diet and exercise alone.Though Trump is in the pink of his health, the mysterious bruise that appeared several times -- before, reappeared on Wednesday when the president held an impromptu press meet outside the White House. Trump was found to have some benign lesions, also known as actinic keratosis (AK), which are rough, scaly patches or bumps on the skin caused by long-term sun exposure.","Trump lost 20 pounds since his last presidential physical test in 2020 and the whispers are that a little pharmaceutical help was taken.

What opinion polls say

About 7.3 million people have cast their ballots over four days of advanced voting — a record number — suggesting growing voter interest ahead of the 28 April federal election.Liberal leader Mark Carney is calling for a strong mandate, while Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre continues to pitch his campaign as a push for change.Key battleground are provinces like Ontario, British Columbia, and Quebec — where margins are expected to be razor-thin. These regions are expected to determine the final outcome.Also read: Canada elections 2025 explained: Who’s running, who can vote, what to watch and why it matters According to CBC, a record 7.3 million Canadians voted during the advance polling period, taking advantage of the four-day window over the long weekend. Preliminary figures from Elections Canada show this marks a 25% increase from the 5.8 million who voted early in 2021.Advance polling gives voters a chance to cast their vote before the official election day. It’s intended to offer more flexibility, especially for those who may be unavailable due to travel, work shifts, or other commitments. The turnout suggests that more Canadians are actively engaging in the democratic process earlier than usual.With the final vote set for Monday, national opinion polls show the Liberals narrowly leading the Conservatives. Reuters reported that the New Democratic Party, led by Jagmeet Singh, is in third, with the Bloc Quebecois trailing in fourth, focusing solely on Quebec.An Ipsos survey puts the Liberals three points ahead, with 41% support compared to 38% for the Conservatives. The numbers suggest a tight race, with smaller parties likely to play a significant role in shaping the next government.","A record 7.3 million Canadians voted during the advance polling period.

Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

“The academy and each branch will judge the achievement, taking into account the degree to which a human was at the heart of the creative authorship when choosing which movie to award,”

How AI usage in movies has divided Hollywood



“I did not realise by sharing this image it would be in such disrespect to the artists and creators of our world.”

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences have confirmed that movies made using generative AI tools remain eligible for Academy Awards (more commonly known as the Oscars ). This is the first time the Academy has directly addressed the use of generative AI, a technology that has gained traction in Hollywood and sparked debate among filmmakers. The Oscar rules now state that AI and other digital tools “neither help nor harm the chances of achieving a nomination.” However, the more a human played a role in a film's creation, the better, the academy added.the new Oscars rules noted.According to a report by Vanity Fair, the Academy even explored amending its submission process to require disclosure of any AI usage, however, it ultimately chose not to implement such a mandate.The latest clarification comes as part of a broader revision to voting and campaigning rules, which now require members to watch every nominated film in each category before casting their final votes.The Academy’s acknowledgement of generative AI in its rules marks a significant shift, which comes after writers’ and actors’ unions pushed for AI safeguards in their recent contracts.The debate over AI’s role reached a flashpoint when The Brutalist—an immigrant epic nominated for 10 Oscar categories—used AI to improve Hungarian accents in actors, prompting both defences of the filmmakers and ethical objections to the technology’s use.The movie’s actor, Adrien Brody, finally won the Oscar for Best Actor for his role in The Brutalist, which also took home awards for cinematography and score. Other nominees, including Emilia Pérez and Dune: Part Two, similarly employed AI tools for enhancements.Some prominent filmmakers have begun to adopt the technology, most notably James Cameron, who joined the board of Stability AI last fall, but the debate persists.Last week, Oscar nominee Demi Moore faced criticism and removed an Instagram post after using an AI app to turn her dog into a human and subsequently apologised for the image.Later on, in a replacement post, Moore wrote:",The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences have confirmed that movies made using generative AI tools remain eligible for Academy Awards.

How Nico Mueller secured the top spot

Andretti driver Nico Mueller and his race engineer Bertrand Mermine have surged to the top of the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard following a dramatic Miami Grand Prix, where post-race penalties reshuffled the final standings in Mueller’s favour. Though he originally crossed the line in 10th, Mueller was promoted to 4th, thanks to a well-timed strategy and a dash of late-race chaos. His calculated decision to split Attack Mode usage proved decisive, paying off when several drivers were hit with time penalties after the chequered flag.The Engineered to Outrun leaderboard celebrates the most dynamic driver-engineer duos in Formula E—tracking those who gain the most positions during a race, with emphasis on overtaking prowess, energy management, and overall race pace. The season concludes with an award for the top-ranked pairing.After Round 5 in Miami, the leaderboard has Maserati MSG Racing’s Stoffel Vandoorne and his race engineer Thibault Arnal on number 2. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries and race engineer Tom Bayles are in third position in the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard.The FIA Formula E Instagram account also shared the update, posting:“@nico.mueller51 overtaking his way up the rankings! With a mega drive from P18 to P4, the @andrettife driver tops the @abbgroup Engineered to Outrun leaderboard after Round 5. #MiamiEPrix #FormulaE #Motorsport #Racing.”Nico Mueller’s rise was the result of strategy combined with fortunate timing. While many drivers delayed activating Attack Mode until later in the race, Mueller opted for a more aggressive strategy—using two four-minute activations, starting with the first on Lap 11 to position himself within points range.By Lap 20, Mueller was running in 10th when a red flag was brought out following a three-car collision. After the restart, as the majority of the grid scrambled to use their remaining Attack Mode activations, Mueller’s earlier strategy gave him an edge.Despite finishing 10th on the road, he was ultimately classified 4th after multiple post-race penalties were issued. Drivers including Norman Nato, Robin Frijns, Oliver Rowland, Sam Bird, and Taylor Barnard were penalized 10 seconds each for misuse of Attack Mode, while Nick Cassidy received a five-second penalty for exceeding track limits.Also Read: Formula E Miami E-Prix 2025: Jake Hughes crashes at chicane, here’s how the multi-car collision changed the outcome.
