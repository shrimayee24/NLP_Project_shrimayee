NEW DELHI: A political row has erupted in Maharashtra over the government's new meat certification initiative. The controversy began when Maharashtra minister Nitesh Rane launched 'Malhar Certification' for Hindu meat traders to ensure “100% Hindu-owned mutton shops, free from adulteration.”Rane stated that Hindu shopkeepers selling 'jhatka' mutton would be granted this certification and urged Hindu consumers to purchase mutton exclusively from certified vendors.Soon after Rane's announcement, the opposition criticised the move, alleging it would divide society.Also read: 'Eating halal not written in Hindu religion': Maharashtra minister Nitesh Rane proposes 'Malhar certification' Congress MLA Nana Patole condemned Rane’s remarks, stating that a minister should not make such divisive statements. “A minister cannot talk like this. It sends a message that the Chief Minister has no control over his ministers. If any minister is inciting conflict between two religions, the CM should take action,” Patole told ANI.Congress leader Aslam Shaikh termed the move unconstitutional. “If this government or Nitesh Rane wants to enter the meat business, then it's good. Our Constitution gives us the freedom to do anything, eat anything, but saying that only one person will do a type of job does not align with our Constitution,” he said.Nationalist Congress Party (Sharad Chandra Pawar faction) MLA Jitendra Awhad also criticised the comments, particularly during the holy month of Ramzan. “When everything is running smoothly in the state, the BJP government tries to stoke Hindu-Muslim issues,” he said. He also questioned the political motive behind the debate on illegal loudspeakers, stating, “Action should be taken where necessary, but why make it a political issue?”Despite the backlash, BJP MLA Sanjay Upadhyay defended Rane’s certification initiative, arguing that ‘Halal’ meat poses health risks. “I have no issue with what people choose to eat, but if someone is being misled, it should be objected to. The chemicals produced during the ‘halal’ process are harmful to the body. I support Nitesh Rane in this case — chicken and mutton shops should have proper licensing,” Upadhyay said.Meanwhile, Rane, justifying his initiative, claimed that the certification would help Hindus identify “rightful mutton shops” run by members of the Hindu community and ensure no adulteration. Announcing the launch on social media platform X, he wrote, “Today, we have taken a very important step for the Hindu community in Maharashtra. Malhar Certification has been launched to ensure access to 100% Hindu-owned mutton shops , free from adulteration.”He further urged people to prioritise certified vendors and avoid purchasing from uncertified shops. “I appeal to everyone to use Malhar Certification and not buy mutton from places without it. This initiative will empower Hindu youth financially,” Rane added.According to the government website, Malhar certification is for jhatka mutton and chicken vendors. “It ensures that goat and sheep meat, sacrificed according to Hindu religious traditions, is fresh, clean, free from saliva contamination, and not mixed with any other animal meat,” the website stated.“This meat is available exclusively through Hindu Khatik community vendors. Therefore, we encourage everyone to purchase mutton only from vendors certified by Malhar,” it said.","Maha minister Nitesh Rane launched 'Malhar Certification' for Hindu meat traders to ensure ‘100% Hindu-owned mutton shops, free from adulteration’ Opposition criticised the move, alleging it would divide society.

Brett Favre Criticizes ESPN's Teaser, Defending Mark Gastineau's Reputation

NFL legend Mark Gastineau is taking a swing at ESPN — legally this time — accusing the network of damaging his reputation by posting an edited video of his altercation with Brett Favre . And now? He wants $25 million in damages.The drama unfolded in November 2023 at a sports show in Chicago, where Mark Gastineau confronted former Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre over a decades-old controversy. The beef? A 2002 game where Brett Favre gave up what many saw as an ""easy"" sack to Michael Strahan — a move that allowed Strahan to break Mark Gastineau’s single-season sack record.In the now-viral clip obtained by ESPN, Mark Gastineau was visibly upset, repeatedly telling Brett Favre that his actions during that game ""hurt me."" The network used the heated exchange as a teaser for theirdocumentary — but according to Mark Gastineau, they left out a crucial part of the story.In his lawsuit, filed in a federal court in New York on March12, 2025, Mark Gastineau argues that ESPN intentionally cut the moment where he and Brett Favre shook hands after the confrontation. This, he says, made him appear far more aggressive than he actually was.Mark Gastineau also claims that he never gave ESPN permission to record the private interaction. To make matters worse, when he officially agreed to participate in thedocumentary in January 2024, there was an understanding that he'd have approval over any edits — including the Brett Favre clip.Now, Mark Gastineau says the edited footage has sparked a wave of online attacks, with people mocking and ridiculing him on social media. Feeling blindsided by the way the situation was portrayed, he's demanding $25 million in damages.Interestingly, Brett Favre seems to be in Mark Gastineau's corner on this one. Back in December 2024, Brett Favre spoke out against ESPN’s teaser, calling it a ""private moment of frustration between two old football warriors"" that shouldn’t have been filmed and released. He even praised Mark Gastineau, saying the controversy should remind people of ""just how great Mark Gastineau was.""As of now, ESPN hasn't responded to the lawsuit — but with a $25 million price tag attached, this legal showdown is far from over.Stay tuned as this sports drama continues to unfold.Also read - Breaking Down the Worst Contracts of NFL Free Agency 2025 — Who Got Overpaid?","NFL legend Mark Gastineau is suing ESPN for $25 million in damages.

Fans Support The Boston Bruins’ Decision To Trade Brad Marchand To The Florida Panthers



Brad Marchand, the former captain of the Boston Bruins, recently got traded to the Florida Panthers and fans are still in shock about it. Recently, former NHL players Paul Bissonnette and Ryan Whitney spoke about how the Boston Bruins were unwilling to settle on an amount with Brad Marchand, which resulted in his trade to the Florida Panthers. But fans dont agree with this.On a recent episode of the Spittin Chiclets podcast, Paul Bissonnetee said, “It was offered exactly what he's making now for three years…and Marchand's camp wanted seven and a half. And Marchand had a meeting with Don Sweeney…and they would not come up on their offer. I thought that that was insane. You wouldn't give Brad Marchand the same amount that you paid Lindholm. That's crazy to me.”However, fans feel otherwise about the whole situation; a fan commented, “dude, they wanted him out... its that simple”, while another fan wrote, “They didn't like his leadership, money was not the problem.”A third fan wrote, “Hes almost 37, frequently injured lately (double hip surgery) & slowing down. 16 yrs in Boston or not, you can't write him a blank check & handcuff a drowning team longer. Bergy, Chara, even Krejci took less at the end to build a better team. Seems like Marchy wouldn't do that”.Another user wrote, “He’s not worth even 5M a year at 37 years old 😂”, while a sixth one noted, “Send me the list of players over 37 that got that high an AAV for 3 years. I’ll wait. We will see what he gets on the open market. I think he will be disappointed”.Brad Marchand’s trade to the Florida Panthers has sent shockwaves across the league. Many fans have slammed the Boston Bruins’ team as well as Don Sweeney for deciding to trade Brad Marchand.However, at a recent interview, Brad Marchand, the former captain of the Boston Bruins have hinted at a possible return to his former team in July. He said, “I know it didn’t come together now. Can things change down the road? Potentially, but that’s to be seen. I’m sure we’ll have a conversation down the road, but I don’t know where that goes.”Also Read: ""He's not good enough"": Connor McDavid’s frustration sparks debate over his leadership as Oilers struggle","Brad Marchand, the former captain of the Boston Bruins, recently got traded to the Florida Panthers.

Mac Jones joins 49ers on two-year deal to bolster quarterback depth: Can he make the difference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/mac-jones-joins-49ers-on-two-year-deal-to-bolster-quarterback-depth-can-he-make-the-difference/articleshow/118958243.cms,"Credit: AP Photos

Mac Jones Joins the San Francisco 49ers in a Two-Year Deal



Quarterback Mac Jones is set to join the San Francisco 49ers , marking a significant moment four years after the team nearly drafted him third overall in the 2021 NFL Draft. Jones has agreed to a two-year contract worth $7 million, including $5 million guaranteed, with a maximum value of $11.5 million. The news was first reported by NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport, and a person familiar with the deal confirmed the terms on Wednesday night, though the official announcement is still pending.Mac Jones’ connection with the 49ers dates back to the 2021 NFL Draft when San Francisco made a bold move, trading three first-round picks to secure the No. 3 overall selection. Head coach Kyle Shanahan was in search of a franchise quarterback and reportedly narrowed his choices down to Jones and Trey Lance. Ultimately, the team opted for Lance, passing on Jones, who was later selected by the New England Patriots at No. 15.The decision to draft Lance instead of Jones did not pan out as expected for the 49ers. Lance struggled with injuries and adjusting to Shanahan's complex offensive system, making just four starts in two seasons. He eventually lost the starting job to Brock Purdy , who was drafted in the seventh round in 2022. Lance was traded to the Dallas Cowboys for a fourth-round pick in August 2023. Purdy has since solidified his position as the team's starting quarterback, creating an opportunity for Jones to step in as a reliable backup.Jones had a promising rookie season with the Patriots in 2021, starting all 17 games and leading the team to a 10–7 record and a playoff appearance. He completed 67.6% of his passes for 3,801 yards, 22 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions, earning his first and only Pro Bowl nod. However, his performance declined after offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels departed the team. In 2023, Jones was replaced as the starter and subsequently traded to the Jacksonville Jaguars.During his time with the Jaguars, Jones started seven games, throwing eight touchdown passes and eight interceptions while completing 65.3% of his passes for 1,672 yards. His overall career stats include 49 starts with an 84.9 passer rating, 54 touchdown passes, 44 interceptions, and an average of 6.7 yards per attempt.The 49ers’ need for a backup quarterback became evident when Joshua Dobbs left in free agency to join the Patriots. With Brandon Allen also entering free agency, Jones steps in as an experienced option behind Purdy. While his role will be as a backup, Jones’ experience and early career success could provide valuable depth to the 49ers’ quarterback room.Also Read: Mike Williams reunites with Chargers on a one-year deal to strengthen wide receiver lineup Jones’ move to San Francisco also offers him a chance to work under Shanahan, whose offensive system has produced consistent results with quarterbacks like Purdy. If Jones can adapt to the system and rediscover his rookie form, he could become a valuable asset for the 49ers.","Mac Jones has agreed to a two-year contract worth $7 million, including $5 million guaranteed, with a maximum value of $11.5 million.

Listen here:Excerpts from the interview:I write about art during the week for my newspaper, The Observer, with what I think of as my right hand. I write about art for my books, art and life and the intersection between them, which is my special subject, with my left hand, if you like. My brain is playing split between these two worlds, between the professional commitments for my newspaper and then for book writing, which is where I feel a freedom and a comfort and a different kind of audience and a different kind of time scheme. And one is able to tell stories at length about painters and life and culture, and, in my case, in the new book, about sudden death and accidents and my father, who flew planes in India, in fact, in the Second World War.The way you describe that perfectly goes to my experience of museums and of looking at art, which all of the people listening will know, which is that when you're in a museum, you miss paintings. There are crowds in front of paintings. There are paintings that you feel are very particularly yours because you found them and you're alone looking at them. And I think of museums as being almost like cities where people walk and they see other people. In the case of artworks, I'm thinking of them as having a kind of personality. I feel that museums are like the places that we live. And they're not very different to me, in my mind. And all of the books that I have written do have moments I've described in the current book 'Thunderclap. They are moments where a person, particularly painters, see a work of art and there's a huge moment, and the feeling that you are seeing something really radically connected to you and only to you, and everybody has a different experience of everything. All of my books are arguing the same thing, which is that the human relationship with art is entirely personal.I always feel that I'm a bit mutinous, about art historians, because with regard to Dutch art, and this very much goes to women painting in the mid century, in the 17th century, we're always being told what to see, what to think. This is a symbol. Here is a skull. It must be about death. Here's a piece of cheese, maybe that's about death… Dutch art is very particularly supposedly full of these, you know, warnings against mortality and vanity and so on, but they really aren't. So one argument about Dutch art is that it's all symbolic. And I think, no, they're not. They're about the incredible beauty of the world and the amazing way that light gives its grace to everything that we look at around us and so on. And they're about the wonder of art, and they're not about something very simple. And. And what is always said about Dutch art, and I think completely wrongly, is that it's a sequence of photographs. And it's so democratic, it's so all embracing, and it's so infinite in its reach through everything that you can see. Everything is imagined, remarked upon, remembered, felt and painted by the artists.I can't paint and I can't sculpt. And I'm terrible at taking photographs, but I appreciate them enormously. So the only thing I have is words because I can't draw. And if I could draw, maybe I would be making art. But as it is, I have the thing I have which is just words and practice with words and so on. So I'm putting words to images and things that I want to praise and things that I want the viewer to see. And it arrives out of the fact that I couldn't be an artist because I had no talent.","Laura Cummings has written three books about Dutch art. She says the human relationship with art is entirely personal. Cummings: 'I can't paint and I can't sculpt. I'm terrible photographs, but I appreciate them enormously. And if I could draw, maybe I would be art'","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118836720,imgsize-23022,width-400,resizemode-4/118836720.jpg"

Mikey Madison won the best actress prize for Brooklyn tragicomedy “Anora.”“Conclave,” which stars Ralph Fiennes as a cardinal corralling conniving clergy as they elect a new pope, beat “The Brutalist,” “Emilia Pérez,” Bob Dylan biopic “ A Complete Unknown "" to the top prize. ""Conclave” was also named outstanding British film and took trophies for editing and adapted screenplay.Supporting performer prizes went to Kieran Culkin for “A Real Pain” and Zoe Saldaña for “Emilia Pérez,"" which also won the award for best film not in the English language.Saldaña won for her role as a lawyer who helps the title character transition to a woman and out of a life of crime. She called the film “the creative challenge of a lifetime.”Best actress nominee Karla Sofía Gascón, who stars as the titular transgender ex-cartel boss in “Emilia Pérez,” wasn’t at the ceremony. Gascón has withdrawn from promoting the film, which has 13 Oscar nominations, amid controversy over her social media posts disparaging Muslims, George Floyd and diversity at the Oscars.Audiard has condemned those comments, but in his acceptance speech thanked Gascón and her co-stars Saldaña and Selena Gomez.“I am deeply proud of what we have all achieved together,"" he said.From the BAFTAs to the OscarsStars including Cynthia Erivo, Hugh Grant, Ariana Grande, Lupita Nyong’o, Timothée Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan walked the red carpet at London’s Royal Festival Hall for the awards, known as BAFTAs.The prizes will be watched for clues about who will triumph at Hollywood’s Academy Awards on March 2, in an unusually hard-to-call awards season.They also have a distinctly British accent. The ceremony kicked off with its kilt-wearing host, Scottish actor David Tennant, leading the audience in a rousing singalong of The Proclaimers’ anthem “I’m Gonna be (500 Miles).”Culkin's award came for “A Real Pain,” about odd couple cousins on a trip to explore their roots. The film's writer and co-star, Jesse Eisenberg, took the BAFTA for best original screenplay.“I’d like to share this with my wife, who didn’t come because she didn’t think I’d win,” Eisenberg quipped.“Anora,” about an exotic dancer entangled with a Russian oligarch's son, had been a best picture favorite after winning the top prizes last week at the Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards.“The Brutalist” had nine BAFTA nominations, while “Anora,” the sci-fi epic “Dune: Part Two” and musical “Wicked” hade seven each. “A Complete Unknown” and Irish-language hip-hop drama “Kneecap” received six nominations apiece.Brody won over stiff competition from Fiennes and Chalamet, who plays the young Dylan in “A Complete Unknown.” The other male actors nominated were Grant for his creepy role in the horror film “ Heretic,” Colman Domingo in real-life prison drama “ Sing Sing ” and Sebastian Stan for his portrayal of a young Donald Trump in “ The Apprentice.”Stan, who is also Oscar nominated, said it was “incredibly validating” to get recognition for the film, which initially struggled to find an American distributor. It's an origins story that focuses on Trump's relationship with ruthless power broker Roy Cohn, played by Jeremy Strong.“We were told this was going to be a thankless job that was never going to lead to anything,” Stan said, describing the movie as a “fair” depiction of the president.Best-actress nominees were Madison, Gascón, Demi Moore for body-horror film “ The Substance,” Ronan for “The Outrun,” Erivo for “Wicked” and Marianne Jean-Baptiste for the Mike Leigh drama “Hard Truths.” Erivo or Jean-Baptiste would have been the first non-white performer to win the leading actress BAFTA.Animated caper “Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl” won awards for best animated feature and best family and children’s film.Sci-fi epic “Dune: Part Two” won prizes for sound and visual effects. “The Brutalist” won for cinematography and musical score. Musical “Wicked” took the costume and production design trophies.Rising stars and lifetime honorsBritain’s film academy introduced changes to increase the awards’ diversity in 2020, when no women were nominated as best director for the seventh year running and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white.Most winners are chosen by 8,000 members of the U.K. academy of industry professionals, with one — the Rising Star Award —- selected by public vote from a shortlist of nominees. This year's winner was David Jonsson, star of high finance drama series “Industry” and London rom-com “Rye Lane.”“Star, I don’t know,” he said. “But rising, I guess.”“Willow” and “Return of the Jedi” actor Warwick Davis received the academy’s top honor, the BAFTA Fellowship, for his screen career and work to create a more inclusive film industry.He founded a talent agency for actors under 5 feet tall, because, he said, “short actors weren’t known for their talent, just their height.”BAFTA chairwoman Sara Putt sent a message of strength to everyone hit by last month’s devastating Los Angeles wildfires. Jamie Lee Curtis, a supporting actress nominee for “The Last Showgirl,” was absent because the fires delayed filming on her current work.The event was without a dash of royal glamour this year. Neither Prince William, who is honorary president of the British film academy, nor his wife Kate are attending. The awards coincide with school holidays for their three children.William, 42, sent a recorded video message that was played before the presentation of the Rising Star Award.","Papal thriller ""Conclave "" wins four prizes including best picture.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

UK Regulator: Apple and Google are the reason why innovation in mobile browsers is not working,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uk-regulator-apple-and-google-are-the-reason-why-innovation-in-mobile-browsers-is-not-working/articleshow/118959641.cms,"Representative image

Apple responds to the UK’s CMA, “We have concerns with this report”



The United Kingdom's competition watchdog has concluded that Apple and Google are stifling innovation in the mobile browser market, with Apple's policies bearing most of the blame according to a final report published Wednesday.The Competition and Markets Authority's (CMA) independent inquiry group found that the mobile browser market is ""not working well for consumers and businesses,"" identifying several anti-competitive practices by both tech giants that limit competition and potentially restrict economic growth.""Following our in-depth investigation, we have concluded that competition between different mobile browsers is not working well, and this is holding back innovation in the UK,"" said Margot Daly, Chair of the CMA's independent inquiry group.The investigation highlighted specific concerns about Apple's policies, including requiring all iOS browsers to use its WebKit browser engine, giving Safari preferential access to features compared to competing browsers, imposing limitations on in-app browsing, and pre-installing Safari as the default browser on iPhones For Google, investigators flagged Chrome's position as the pre-installed default browser on most Android devices and revenue sharing arrangements with Apple. The report noted that Google pays Apple ""a significant share of search revenue"" in exchange for being the default search engine on iPhones, which investigators say is ""significantly reducing their financial incentives to compete.""The duopoly's market dominance is striking, with Safari accounting for 88% of browsers on Apple devices and Chrome representing 77% on Android devices in 2024.In response, Apple defended its position: ""Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users. We have concerns with this report and believe the remedies it discusses would undermine privacy, security, and the overall user experience.""While the report suggests potential remedies—including forcing Apple to allow alternative browser engines on iOS and requiring both companies to offer browser choice screens during device setup—no immediate enforcement actions will be taken.Instead, the CMA has launched separate investigations into both companies to determine if they have ""strategic market status"" under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act. If designated with such status, Apple and Google could face stricter antitrust requirements and potential fines of up to 10% of annual turnover for violations.These investigations are expected to conclude later this year.","UK's competition watchdog concludes Apple and Google stifling innovation in mobile browser market.

Google 'wants' intelligent robot to deal with messiness

The highs and lows of Google's robotics journey

Google: Robotics AI still in 'early phase'

Alphabet Inc’s research division, Google DeepMind , announced the launch of two groundbreaking artificial intelligence models aimed at transforming the robotics industry. The new models, Gemini Robotics and Gemini Robotics-ER, are designed to tackle a persistent challenge in robotics: Enabling machines to adapt to unpredictable, real-world scenarios. Gemini Robotics, an offshoot of Google’s flagship Gemini AI model, focuses on enhancing robots’ dexterity and interactivity. Meanwhile, Gemini Robotics-ER emphasizes spatial reasoning, offering developers advanced tools to create robots capable of navigating complex environments using Gemini’s powerful reasoning abilities.Introducing the AI models, Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote on Twitter, ""We’ve always thought of robotics as a helpful testing ground for translating AI advances into the physical world. Today we’re taking our next step in this journey with our newest Gemini 2.0 robotics models. They show state of the art performance on two important benchmarks - generalization and embodied reasoning - which enable robots to draw from Gemini’s multimodal understanding of the world to make changes on the fly + adapt to their surroundings. This milestone lays the foundation for the next generation of robotics that can be helpful across a range of applications.""According to a report by Bloomberg, DeepMind engineer Kanishka Rao said that these advancements bring Google closer to realizing “general purpose robotics” — machines versatile enough to handle a wide range of tasks. “Our worlds are super messy and dynamic and rich,” Rao reportedly said during a media briefing. “A general purpose intelligent robot needs to be able to deal with that messiness.”The announcement comes amid a resurgence of interest in robotics across Silicon Valley, with heavyweights like Meta Platforms Inc, Tesla Inc, and OpenAI intensifying their efforts, and startups securing massive funding rounds. Google’s latest push builds on this momentum, showcasing its technology in a pre-taped demonstration.Google’s robotics journey has seen its ups and downs over the years. Over a decade ago, the company acquired eight robotics firms to pursue co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin’s vision of consumer-friendly robots powered by machine learning. Those efforts eventually shifted to Google X, Alphabet’s moonshot lab, and spawned Everyday Robots in 2021, a unit focused on mundane tasks like trash sorting. However, Alphabet shuttered Everyday Robots in 2023 amid widespread budget cuts, though it vowed to integrate the technology into ongoing robotics projects. Now, with generative AI at the forefront, Google appears to be reinvigorating its ambitions.The new models remain in an “early exploration” phase, according to DeepMind research scientist Vikas Sindhwani. Safety is a priority, with the Gemini models built to exhibit “common sense safety” in physical settings. Google plans a cautious rollout, starting with robots operating at a safe distance from humans and gradually increasing interaction as safety improves.To accelerate development, Google is collaborating with robotics companies like Apptronik, with whom it is crafting humanoid robots, as well as Agile Robots and Boston Dynamics — the latter a former Alphabet subsidiary sold to SoftBank in 2017.","Gemini Robotics and Gemini Robotics-ER are Google's new artificial intelligence models.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says ‘more proud of a…’ than ChatGPT maker’s team,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openai-ceo-sam-altman-says-more-proud-of-a-than-chatgpt-makers-team/articleshow/118749816.cms,"Sam Altman gives update on GPT-4.5

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat. In the post, Altman wrote “very proud of the openai team for what is perhaps the most impressive scientific/technical breakthrough of recent decades…thought that was the thing i'd always be most proud of in life”. Adding further, he wrote “turns out i am now more proud of a preemie baby for learning how to eat on his own!”.In a follow-up post, Altman wrote “i realize i am getting neurochemically hacked here but idc, it's the best)”.Sam Altman welcomed his baby boy last month with his partner and software engineer Oliver Mulherin. The baby arrived prematurely and has been receiving care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).In another news, the CEO shared an update about the company’s latest version of the large language model (LLM), GPT-4.5 . In an X post, Altman announced that GPT-4.5 is expected to roll out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers. However, he noted that the update will be a staggered rollout over several days to manage high demand and ensure a smooth user experience.Altman also explained that launching with a low rate limit would restrict usage and prevent users from having meaningful interactions with the new model. The staggered release will allow users to have longer conversations with GPT-4.5, even if it means some subscribers will have to wait a bit longer to access it.In his X announcement, Altman wrote: “We are likely going to roll out GPT-4.5 to the plus tier over a few days. There is no perfect way to do this; we wanted to do it for everyone tomorrow, but it would have meant we had to launch with a very low rate limit. We think people are gonna use this a lot and love it.”","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat.
