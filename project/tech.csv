Signs that cancer is there in their body and that they need to do something about it. That’s what NFL legend Michael Strahan’s daughter, 20-year-old Isabella Strahan had wished for herself.Isabella Strahan is a brain tumor survivor, and she wished she had known about the cancer growing inside of her earlier.

At the tender age of 19, having a lot of maturity about life, and a deadly disease like cancer, it all boils down to a speechless moment for all of us.Isabella Strahan is one of the twin daughters of the New York Giants DE Michael Strahan. The other twin is Sophia Strahan. Sophia was there to support Isabella throughout her cancer-fighting journey, from the diagnosis of the symptoms to sharing them with her parents.Isabella Strahan first noticed something was wrong with her when she was walking in a zigzag fashion. The dizzy walking was also accompanied by frequent nauseous bouts and vomiting of blood from her mouth.Isabella shared with, “I didn’t notice anything was off till probably like October 1. That’s when I definitely noticed headaches, nausea, couldn’t walk straight.” This is exactly when her twin sister, Sophia asked Isabella to see a doctor.Science says, 100% of their gene makeup is shared between identical twins, there’s something called twin telepathy too, between identical twins. This means that if something was wrong with Isabella Strahan, Sophia caught it and decided to take action for it. Thanks to her calling!On theshow, co-host of, Michael Strahan’s cancer warrior daughter, Isabella Strahan shares,“I learned you should advocate for yourself. I think I should have known something was wrong earlier. I think it’s always important to trust yourself and trust your body. I think that’s something I’ve taken into account, is always staying positive but always really knowing in your mind if something is wrong.”Like, 20-year-old Isabella Strahan wished she had known about her brain tumor earlier, everyone must understand their body’s signals about cancer.

Yeah, of course, we make a lot of money and we can feed our families, but at the end of the day if they say, ‘You’re not coming to work tomorrow, you’re going over there,’ they can decide that. They got to change that a little bit. But still grateful that we’re here and that we can live this every single day. I think everybody who’s in here is blessed.

It felt like a reminder that in the NBA, players are assets, not people.This isn't the first time the NBA has faced criticism for its treatment of players. Remember the Malice at the Palace? Or the infamous Grinch Who Stole Christmas trade that sent Carmelo Anthony to the Denver Nuggets? These events, while different in nature, all highlight the power imbalance that exists between players and teams.Schroder's ""modern-day slavery"" comment might be hyperbolic, but it serves as a wake-up call.

Alex Bregman Receives A $30 Million Per Year Offer From The Chicago Cubs With Multiple Opt-Outs



Alex Bregman’s Silence Over The Speculations Has Confused Fans About His Feelings



Alex Bregman , one of the most talented and popular players in Major League Baseball, has continued to remain a free agent even when the Spring Training is just a few days away. While there have been strong rumours of him returning to the Houston Astros , it now looks like he might be receiving a pretty interesting offer from a new team - the Chicago Cubs .According to Matthew Trueblood of North Side Baseball, Alex Bregman has received an interesting offer from the Chicago Cubs for a whopping $30 million annually for a period of four years. This is a $4 million increase from the offer that Alex Bregman had received from his former team, the Houston Astros when they offered him $156 million for a period of six years. That deal translated to $26 million per year for six years, which is $2 million less than what he previously got.But that is not all; the Chicago Cubs are offering him this four year deal with multiple opt outs, While it is not known what Alex Bregman and his sports agent, Scott Boras, think about it, fans are not that happy with this news.A fan took to X and wrote, “I'm down with this, but it's still crazy to me that Bregman is $30m/yr”, while another fan wrote, “Hard pass on him for $30M per. He’s good but not $30m great these days.”Another fan posted, “Who pays 30 million for a guy still available in February, overpay”A fourth fan wrote about how Alex Bregman is on the “downside of his career”. The fan wrote, “He ain’t worth that much. Hes on the downside of his career. His offensive stats at Wrigley suck. His defense is sub/equal to Nico. I’d rather us roll with who we have now. We’ve got a solid ass team that I think makes playoffs and wins playoff games.”With Pete Alonso signing a deal with the New York Mets, the pressure is pretty high on Alex Bregman currently. Many fans have criticised Alex Bregman for turning down the Houston Astros as people believe he was receiving a “fair deal” from his former team.Despite the trolling that Alex Bregman has received in the last couple of days, he has maintained complete silence over it. Alex Bregman has also been missing from his wife, Reagan Bregman’s Instagram stories lately.It might be a conscious move by the couple to maintain privacy as fans continue to criticise Alex Bregman’s decision making skills.With Spring Training starting in a few weeks, Alex Bregman’s moves are constantly being watched and waited for.Also Read: Alex Bregman's wife, Reagan Bregman focuses on health and family, but Alex Bregman is missing from the picture","The Chicago Cubs have offered Alex Bregman $30 million per year for four years.

Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic. In his memoir, Spare, the Duke of Sussex talks about reaching out to a medium with supernatural abilities to communicate with Diana, who passed away in a car accident in Paris in 1997, just before his 13th birthday, The Mirror reported.The Duke received a message from his mother through the psychic, who told him, ""You're living the life she wanted for you."" Harry, now 40, says that the medium also told him his mother was with him ""right now,"" which made his neck warm and his eyes fill with tears. The psychic shared that Diana knew Harry was ""looking for clarity"" and ""feels your confusion."" She added that Diana understood Harry had ""so many questions"" and that answers would come in time.Another anecdote involved Prince Harry’s son, Archie. The psychic reportedly described how Diana’s spirit witnessed Archie accidentally breaking a Christmas tree ornament shaped like Queen Elizabeth. When asked, Harry admitted the incident had occurred, adding that Archie had attempted to fix the ornament.The medium suggested Diana found humour in the situation, delighting in the antics of her grandson she never had the chance to meet.In Spare, Prince Harry also recounts an extraordinary encounter with a leopard during a trip to Botswana with his brother, Prince William. He interpreted the animal’s presence as a comforting sign from his late mother, suggesting that ""everything will be fine."" However, the experience was not without fear, as he briefly worried the leopard might attack.Harry has been candid about the psychological toll of losing Diana so young. As reported by The Mirror, he disclosed a haunting period after her death when he entertained the possibility that she had staged her demise. His anguish led him to repeatedly drive through the Paris tunnel where Diana’s life was cut short, attempting to make sense of the tragedy.","Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic.

""The cake was covered with a thick layer of meat floss, so I was just chewing it until I bit into something hard. I immediately spat it out,"" she explained.Initially assuming it was a bad quality, Liu prepared to complain to the bakery.

Al-Nuri Mosque: Iraq’s leaning 'hunchback' minaret rises again after years in ruins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iraqs-leaning-hunchback-minaret-rises-again-after-years-in-ruins/articleshow/117977421.cms,"The Al-Hadba minaret in Mosul, Iraq, has been rebuilt, restoring its historic presence after being destroyed during ISIS rule. Known as the ""hunchback"" minaret, it earned its name due to its leaning shape.Unesco spearheaded the restoration of this architectural marvel, which stands as part of the Al-Nuri Mosque , utilising original brickwork in the reconstruction process.Abdullah Mahmoud from Iraq's antiquities department expressed the significance: ""Al-Hadba is our identity, and restoring it means the city has reclaimed its identity"". The 12th-century structure maintains its distinctive 160-centimetre lean, identical to its tilt in the 1960.The Al-Nuri Mosque, where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed his self-styled caliphate in July 2014, was razed in June 2017 during Mosul's liberation battle. Iraqi officials stated that IS forces planted explosives before withdrawing.The five-year Unesco restoration incorporated 26,000 original bricks for the exterior, with 96,000 new bricks added internally for structural support. The foundation received additional reinforcement to stabilise the tilt.The restoration effort extended to the mosque's columns, dome and courtyard. The mihrab was restored using original stonework, whilst the minbar required substantial reconstruction due to missing original components.Former muezzin Imad Zaki observes the restoration daily, stating: ""Every day I stand here for an hour to watch as they are restored to their original state. Today one can feel the spirituality. It's as if our souls have finally found peace.""Unesco's broader restoration initiative includes the Al-Tahira Church from 1862, featuring reconstructed arcades, pillars and stained-glass windows. Archaeological discoveries include an underground cellar and wine vessels, now displayed beneath glass flooring.Unesco Iraq's senior project manager Maria Acetoso noted the transformation: ""When I arrived here in 2019, it looked like a ghost city. In five years plus, there has been a massive change.""Despite progress, Mosul's recovery continues. The clearance of 12,000 tonnes of debris was necessary for landmark restoration, whilst numerous neighbourhoods remain damaged.In the Old City, buildings marked 'safe' in red indicate explosive clearance. Many former inhabitants, particularly Christians, await return.Mohammed Kassem, now residing in a new dwelling, believes the city requires further reconstruction and the return of its original residents, particularly the Christian community.Saad Mohammed, 65, residing opposite Al-Nuri Mosque, recounts the IS period: ""We opened the window once and saw the black IS flag on top of the minaret. Then we opened it again, and the minaret was gone."" Now, with restored landmarks, he remarks, ""Today the minaret has risen again.

Patrick Mahomes on why Taylor Swift should sit out the big game

The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles are warming up for the second Super Bowl in three years with minimal rancor. ""Bad Blood"" from Taylor Swift's 1989 album may make it to the halftime show, and Kendrick Lamar has been announced as the headliner with SZA as a special guest. Lamar, who won five Grammys for his diss track ""Not Like Us,"" is set to perform.Some fans are eagerly awaiting the collaboration between Lamar and Swift, whom they have been close to for more than a decade. However, during Super Bowl opening night, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes dispelled these rumors, saying that Swift will not be performing at Caesars Superdome.One of the major 2025 TV event will be Super Bowl LIX, with the Philadelphia Eagles against the Kansas City Chiefs. Fans will be able to enjoy a halftime show headlined by Kendrick Lamar, but Taylor Swift, who is a Chiefs fan, will not perform. Patrick Mahomes predicts that the event will be entertaining, especially with Lamar's electric performance and Swift's support for the Chiefs.Taylor Swift is a very entertaining pop star with the voice, stage presence, and song catalog to headline a Super Bowl halftime show. But Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes thinks it would be perfect for her to sit out the game.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

However, its Chinese origins have triggered scrutiny, with US government agencies like the Navy and NASA already restricting its use.Asides Navy and NASA, Texas became the first US state to block the AI application on government devices, with Governor Greg Abbott stating, ""Texas will not allow the Chinese Communist Party to infiltrate our state's critical infrastructure through data-harvesting AI and social media apps.""Cybersecurity experts have raised significant concerns about the app's data practices.

ByteDance OmniHuman-1 sample

What ByteDance researchers said about OmniHuman-1



TikTok parent ByteDance has developed a new AI model called OmniHuman-1 . The latest model can generate realistic videos from photos and sound bites. This comes after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI expanded access to its video-generation tool, Sora, making it available to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users in December 2024. Last year, Google DeepMind also announced its Veo model which can create “high-quality, high-definition videos based on text or image prompts in a wide range of cinematic and visual styles with exceptional speed.” However, both OpenAI and Google's models that turn photos into videos are still not available to the public.In a paper (seen by the South China Morning Post), the ByteDance team behind OmniHuman-1 claimed that the multimodal model excels at creating videos of people speaking, singing, and moving with a quality “significantly outperforming existing audio-conditioned human video-generation methods”. While OmniHuman-1 has not yet been publicly released, sample videos have generated significant buzz online. One of the demo videos shows a 23-second clip of Albert Einstein giving a speech that was shared on YouTube.In a recently published technical paper, ByteDance researchers Lin Gaojie, Jiang Jianwen, Yang Jiaqi, Zheng Zerong, and Liang Chao introduced a new training strategy that integrates diverse datasets of text, audio and movement to enhance video-generation models. With this approach, the company aims to tackle challenges faced by global researchers in scaling such models.ByteDance also claimed that its method advances conventional video generation without directly naming competing AI tools. The researchers highlighted that their data-mixing approach allows for realistic video generation across various aspect ratios and body proportions, ranging from close-up facial shots to full-body visuals.The generated clips exhibit detailed facial expressions synchronised with audio, along with natural head and gesture movements, potentially enabling broader real-world applications.Among the sample videos released, one features a man delivering a TED Talk-style speech with lifelike hand gestures and synchronised lip movements, making it nearly indistinguishable from a real recording, the report adds.",TikTok parent ByteDance has developed a new AI model called OmniHuman-1.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

AI researchers develop 'reasoning' model for under $50 like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-researchers-develop-reasoning-model-for-under-50-like-openais-o1-and-deepseeks-r1/articleshow/117986776.cms,"How researchers developed reasoning model

A team of AI researchers from Stanford University and the University of Washington have achieved a breakthrough in AI development by training a sophisticated “reasoning” model for less than $50 in cloud compute credits. Researchers used AI models by Google, Alibaba to create a chatbot with reasoning level as good as the ChatGPT-maker OpenAI ’s o1 LLMs.The model, named s1, is claimed to exhibit performance comparable to cutting-edge reasoning models like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1 on tests evaluating math and coding abilities. The s1 model , along with the data and code used in its training, has been made available on GitHub.The researchers behind s1 said that they utilised a readily available base model and refined it through a process known as distillation – a technique that involves extracting the “reasoning” capabilities from another AI model by training s1 on its answers.The researchers claim that their model s1 has been distilled from Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model. This approach mirrors the method used by Berkeley researchers who created an AI reasoning model for around $450 last month.The researchers behind s1 aimed to identify the simplest approach to achieve strong reasoning performance and ""test-time scaling,"" which allows an AI model to deliberate more before generating a response.“Test-time scaling is a promising new approach to language modeling that uses extra test-time compute to improve performance,” the researchers said in their paper published last week (via TechCrunch), adding that they “seek the simplest approach to achieve test-time scaling and strong reasoning performance.”The s1 research suggests that reasoning models can be effectively distilled using a relatively small dataset and a process called supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where an AI model is explicitly trained to mimic specific behaviors in the dataset.“First, we curate a small dataset s1K of 1,000 questions paired with reasoning traces relying on three criteria we validate through ablations: difficulty, diversity, and quality. Second, we develop budget forcing to control test-time compute by forcefully terminating the model’s thinking process or lengthening it by appending “Wait” multiple times to the model’s generation when it tries to end. This can lead the model to doublecheck its answer, often fixing incorrect reasoning steps,” the researchers said.","Researchers from Stanford University and the University of Washington have created a sophisticated reasoning model for less than $50 in cloud compute credits.
