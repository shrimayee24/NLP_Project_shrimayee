When Bill Gates predicted the 'demise' of Apple's most-popular gadget,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-bill-gates-predicted-the-demise-of-apples-most-popular-gadget/articleshow/116907129.cms,"Poll Which Gadget Do You Use the Most? Laptop Smartphone

Bill Gates shares ‘tip’ from his childhood for parents

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates predicted the decline of the iPod long before it happened. Nearly two decades ago, when the iPod was revolutionizing music consumption and Apple was dominating the MP3 player market, Gates made a bold prediction about its future. In a 2005 interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, he stated that the iPod’s dominance would eventually fade as smartphones emerged, offering much more than just music playback. At the time, this prediction seemed unlikely, as the iPhone wouldn’t debut until 2007, and smartphones were still primarily used by business professionals.Despite the iPod’s immense popularity, Gates foresaw a shift in consumer needs. “I don’t think the success of the iPod can last, as good as Apple is,” he then said, emphasizing that consumers would soon demand devices with broader capabilities.Gates compared the iPod to Apple’s earlier Macintosh computers, which initially led the market but were overtaken by competitors offering more versatile solutions. Gates’ insight into the evolving tech landscape proved to be strikingly accurate, as smartphones gradually replaced single-function devices like the iPod.Bill Gates believes that the constant distractions of smartphones and social media would have hindered his path to becoming a billionaire. In a recent blog post, Gates reflected on his childhood which was marked by significant periods of unstructured time spent reading and thinking. He believes this developed his ability to focus and delve into deep thought which was crucial to his success.Gates referred to Jonathan Haidt’s The Anxious Generation and questioned whether the existing technology-driven environment wouldn’t have allowed him to develop these habits. He even highlighted that excessive screen time, particularly on social media, has been linked to a surge in mental health issues among teenagers which includes anxiety, depression, eating disorders, self-harm, and decreased self-esteem.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates predicted the decline of the iPod long before it happened.

Lessons in gun safety

Rapper OG 2 LOW has ignited a firestorm on social media after an unsettling incident during a live recording of the "" 1 on 1 W/ Mike D "" podcast. The rapper, known for his candid storytelling, accidentally shot himself while discussing his career and future on the show, leading to immediate shock and concern among viewers and the podcast crew.The moment unfolded unexpectedly as OG 2 LOW was in the middle of an engaging anecdote when a muffled ""pop"" interrupted his story. Viewers were left stunned when it became clear that the sound was the result of a gun accidentally going off in the rapper's pocket. The pistol discharged, injuring OG 2 LOW in the leg. The injury, though not life-threatening, caused a stir, and live-streamed footage of the incident quickly spread across social media platforms.""Who got shot?"" host Mike D immediately asked, his voice tinged with shock, before confirming that OG 2 LOW was the only one hurt. Despite the surprise, the rapper appeared alert and composed, further assuring fans that the injury was not severe. The incident, however, left the room in an eerie silence before the live recording resumed.Fans and online commentators were quick to draw comparisons to the infamous 2008 incident involving former NFL player Plaxico Burress. The wide receiver unintentionally shot himself in the thigh while at a nightclub, sparking an ongoing debate about gun safety. With OG 2 LOW's accident unfolding on a public platform, the parallels were hard to ignore.The live footage soon went viral, with clips circulating widely on platforms like Twitter and Instagram. Memes flooded social media, some expressing relief that the injury wasn’t worse, while others criticized the rapper for carrying a weapon during an interview. ""How does that even happen?"" one Twitter user commented. ""This ain’t the first time a celeb shot themselves, but it’s the most shocking.""The incident prompted an outpouring of opinions on gun safety. Some called for better regulations on carrying firearms in public spaces, while others expressed concern over the potential dangers of untrained individuals possessing weapons.In the aftermath of the accident, OG 2 LOW and Mike D reassured fans that everyone was safe. ""Right now, man, we’re just being grateful that everyone is safe, everyone is good,"" OG 2 LOW said, reflecting on the chaos that had just unfolded.Mike D lightened the mood by adding, ""We had to take a small break. We had a pop, a moment, you know what I’m saying? It’s never happened on '1 on 1 with Mike D.' But tonight, with my brother Tulo, every time we get together, we make history. So, I guess we just made history, y’all.""Despite the lighthearted remarks, the incident remains a sobering reminder of the importance of gun safety.The shooting has reignited discussions about responsible gun ownership and safety, particularly in public settings. While OG 2 LOW's injury was minor, similar incidents have had far more serious consequences. In Burress’s case, the accidental discharge of his weapon resulted in a jail sentence and public scrutiny. Later, Burress became an advocate for gun safety, stressing the importance of proper licensing and training.Experts argue that stricter adherence to gun safety regulations is crucial, especially for high-profile individuals. Public figures, often seen as role models, are under heightened scrutiny regarding their actions and behavior, including their handling of firearms."," OG 2 LOW accidentally shot himself during a live recording of the ""1 on 1 W/ Mike D "" podcast.

Capable of engaging targets up to 200 kilometres away, THAAD covers a larger area than the Patriot missile system and complements other defence platforms like the Aegis and Ground-based Midcourse systems.

A THAAD battery includes six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors, an advanced AN/TPY-2 radar system, and a fire control unit. Deployment: Operated by a crew of 95 soldiers, the system is rapidly deployable and designed to protect against evolving missile threats both within and outside the atmosphere.

The United States' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system was deployed in Israel to intercept a Houthi ballistic missile launched from Yemen, Times of Israel reported. This marks the first operational use of the advanced missile defence system since its deployment to Israel in October. Footage shared on social media captured the dramatic launch of a THAAD interceptor, with an American soldier exclaiming, ""Eighteen years I’ve been waiting for this.""The missile, reportedly targeting Israel, was neutralised by air defence systems. However, the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) have not specified whether the interception was achieved by the American THAAD or an Israeli system. According to sources cited by Reuters, an analysis is underway to determine the success of the THAAD system.The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is a cornerstone of the US ballistic missile defence network. Designed to intercept short- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles during their terminal phase, THAAD employs “hit-to-kill” technology, where interceptors physically collide with incoming missiles to destroy them. This approach minimises collateral damage and maximises precision.Originally developed by Lockheed Martin in the 1990s, THAAD has undergone significant testing and enhancements. The US Army currently operates seven THAAD batteries, with deployments in strategic locations such as Guam and South Korea, and most recently, Israel.","The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is a cornerstone of the US ballistic missile defence network.

'Exhausted' execs pin hopes on Sussexes’ cookery show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/is-netflix-over-harry-and-meghan-exhausted-execs-pin-hopes-on-sussexes-cookery-show/articleshow/116359484.cms,"As per the sources, Netflix executives are “exhausted” from working with Markle.

Polo flops and “box office poison” drama

Cookery show under pressure

The Sussex struggle: From Hollywood darlings to “colossal bombs”

Crisis control or end of the road?

It seems like the honeymoon phase between Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, and Netflix is officially over. Once hailed as the streaming platform’s dream duo, the Sussexes’ partnership with Netflix has hit a rough patch, with insiders whispering about mounting frustration and dwindling faith in their ability to deliver hits.The latest debacle? Their five-part documentary about polo, which critics have torched as a “tedious inside look” and a “dull indulgence.” One reviewer even joked it felt like a spoof designed to play in the background of Succession.As per the sources quoted by the Daily Mail, Netflix executives are “exhausted” from working with Markle. The fallout is apparently so bad that her upcoming cookery show—still without a premiere date—is being labeled as her “make or break” moment. “It’s so much work with her, and, bluntly, the ‘deliverable’ does not seem to be worth it,” one insider said.Adding fuel to the fire, there’s been zero buzz around the polo series. No press tours, no promotional events, no hype. Even Nacho Figueras, Harry’s polo pal and a star of the series, has barely mentioned it on social media. Hollywood veteran Sean McNulty told The Daily Beast: “The lack of a proper press campaign for a Harry and Meghan project is eyebrow-raising, to say the least.”According to reports, Meghan’s cookery show is now the Sussexes’ last hope at staying in Netflix’s good graces. One entertainment exec was quotes by the Daily Mail as saying, “Her show will have to be an enormous hit to turn around their deal and their reputations in this town.”The show is expected to drop in early 2024, coinciding with Harry’s appearance at the Winter Invictus Games in Canada and the launch of Meghan’s homeware brand, American Riviera Orchard . Talk about multitasking under pressure.Critics are having a field day with Harry and Meghan’s current reputation—or lack thereof. Marketing expert Tony Case didn’t mince words, was quoted by the Daily Beast as saying, “Harry and Meghan are box office poison. Everyone is running away from this colossal bomb.”He added, “They set out to conquer America, but no one here found them—or what they’re selling—to be particularly compelling.”Even their highly-publicized project Meet Me at the Lake, based on a best-selling novel, remains in limbo. With no production in sight, it’s unlikely to materialize before their Netflix deal is up for renewal next year.Friends who once hyped their projects are unusually quiet, fueling speculation that Hollywood may be losing patience with the couple. A source quoted in Closer Magazine tried to defend the Sussexes, blaming Netflix for pushing a “reality TV angle” that was out of their control.","The Sussexes’ partnership with Netflix has hit a rough patch, with insiders whispering about mounting frustration and dwindling faith in their ability to deliver hits. “It’s so much work with her, and, bluntly, the ‘deliverable’ does not seem to be worth it,” one insider said.

Witnesses say an argument between Cruz and Hodges quickly escalated, leading to Cruz spitting in Hodges’ face before stabbing him in the stomach.

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

How to update KYC online

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Here’s what Suchir Balaji's mother wrote

Update on @suchirbalaji

We hired private investigator and did second autopsy to throw light on cause of death. Private autopsy doesn’t confirm cause of death stated by police.

Suchir’s apartment was ransacked , sign of struggle in the bathroom and looks like some one hit him in bathroom based on blood spots.

It’s a cold blooded mu*d*r declared by authorities as suicide.

We demand FBi investigation

@elonmusk @VivekGRamaswamy @GavinNewsom @MEA

Mother of Suchir Balaji , a 26-year-old researcher at OpenAI , is requesting help from Elon Musk following her son's death. Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment earlier this month. His mother posted on social media, tagging Musk and asking for an FBI investigation . Police stated, “no evidence of foul play was found during the initial investigation”. However, the San Francisco Chief Medical Examiner's Office determined Balaji's death a suicide. Balaji worked at OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT .In her post, Balaji’s mother - Poornima Rao expressed her worries and stated that “private autopsy doesn’t confirm cause of death stated by police.” She called for intervention from US authorities, stating that an FBI investigation is necessary to address the matter. Other than Elon Musk, she tagged American biotech entrepreneur and politician Vivek Ramaswamy and Gavin Newsom – Governor of California.The post has since gained attention, sparking a wave of responses on social media. It caught Musk’s attention as well who replied saying “This doesn’t seem like a suicide”.Suchir Balaji's mother further pleads saying “@elonmusk please support us”.In an interview with Business Insider last week, Rao revealed that Balaji had grown increasingly disillusioned with artificial intelligence (AI), particularly OpenAI’s shift toward commercialization with ChatGPT. She said, “He felt AI is a harm to humanity,” describing how her son, Suchir Balaji, transitioned from boundless optimism about AI’s potential to profound skepticism. Reflecting on his tragic death, she added, “It doesn’t look like a normal situation.”","Suchir Balaji, a 26-year-old researcher at OpenAI, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment earlier this month.

Tesla and Starlink CEO Elon Musk wants you to take note. The world's richest man who has long described Mars as critical to humanity's survival has an 'alien warning'. ""If future aliens see us, they will say; there they had rocket and everything, still they regulated themselves,"" said Musk addressing a crowd that roared with laughter.The video was shared by Twitter user DogeDesigner with the caption: ""Future aliens will make fun of us if we are unable to go on Mars because of regulations."" To this Elon Musk replied with an affirmative ""Yes"".Recently, Musk was also spotted werning a T-Shirt that said: 'Occupy Mars'. This photo too was shared by DogeDesigner on Twitter.Elon Musk envisions a future where Mars isn't just a planet, but a ""New World,"" echoing the historical naming of the Americas. This idea, shared on X (formerly Twitter) alongside a NASA image of Mars' Gale Crater, is just one piece of his larger ambition to establish a self-sustaining human civilization on the Red Planet.Musk's drive to colonize Mars stems from his belief that it's crucial for the long-term survival of human consciousness. He considers Earth fragile and sees Mars as a vital backup plan against potential catastrophes. ""Earth is great, but it’s fragile. We need a backup,"" he explained, emphasizing the need for a future beyond Earth's limitations. SpaceX 's Starship rocket is central to this vision. Designed for reusability and capable of carrying 100 passengers and vital cargo, Starship is intended to make interplanetary travel affordable. Musk outlined plans for five uncrewed Mars missions over the next two years. These missions will deliver essential resources like water, oxygen, fuel, and construction equipment.Musk believes ""Starship will make life multi-planetary, preserving life as we know it from extinction events on Earth."" He anticipates the first crewed mission could launch in the early 2030s. His long-term strategy involves utilizing Martian resources to build infrastructure, reducing reliance on Earth for resupply.Last week, Musk suggested renaming Mars to ""New World."" In an X post, he compared the idea to how America was named and included a photo of Mars' Gale Crater taken by the Curiosity rover. This proposal aligns with Musk's ambition to establish a self-sustaining human colony on Mars.","Elon Musk: If future aliens see us, they will say; there they had rocket and everything, still they regulated themselves.

Wicked Director Jon M. Chu Makes Movie Magic with Apple Vision Pro | Apple TV

Here’s how Apple Vision Pro helped in Wicked’s production



“So for Wicked we had a lot of visual effects all around the world. I could be at my house and I could have a screen that was bigger than the one we had in the screening room. And I could be talking to all the people in all the different continents and I would watch the playback and I would bring it close.”

“I could draw on the screen itself through Evercast. You can actually use a pen and use my finger and draw on where like hey, this ear looks weird on this, on the goat. It just adds new dimension, to how you see things. And as a creator, as a storyteller, everything's perspectives,”

“Steve Jobs always said that computers were a bicycle for the mind and this felt like a rocket ship for my imagination,”

What Apple said about Wicked’s director



“Before Wicked became a box office sensation and cultural phenomenon, Jon M. Chu was among the first filmmakers to put

spatial computing

to the ultimate test. Apple Vision Pro’s infinite canvas enabled him to edit and produce parts of the movie, fostering his creativity and imagination. Discover how he brought the land of Oz to life with Apple Vision Pro.”

Director of the movie “Wicked,” John M Chu has revealed that he used Apple’s mixed reality headset , Vision Pro, during the film’s post-production.

Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, and his luxurious $500 million yacht, Koru, became the focal point of a dramatic episode on New Year’s Eve near St. Barts. As per reports, customs officials conducted a surprise inspection of the massive vessel while Bezos himself was absent. Instead, his fiancée, Lauren Sánchez, took center stage, drawing attention as she lounged on deck in a Versace bikini and a wide-brimmed hat. Despite the unexpected intrusion, the inspection was characterized as routine, lasting approximately three hours. This incident comes amidst a whirlwind of high-profile appearances and speculations surrounding the couple’s lavish lifestyle.The customs inspection began unexpectedly as Koru cruised the waters near St. Barts. Uniformed officers boarded the 417-foot yacht and meticulously searched the vessel under the guidance of a stewardess. Reports indicate that the search lasted approximately three hours, during which time officials methodically combed through the opulent yacht.Despite the disruption, the atmosphere aboard the yacht remained relatively calm. Sánchez appeared composed throughout the process, engaging with friends on deck. Among the notable individuals present was her ex-boyfriend, former NFL star Tony Gonzalez, who shares a son with Sánchez. Gonzalez even took a swim in the ocean while officers conducted their search.While an event of this nature might typically create tension, Sánchez’s demeanor suggested little cause for concern. Photos captured by Page Six showed her smiling for the cameras, a stewardess briefing her on the situation in a composed manner. The inspection, according to sources, was a standard procedure and posed no significant threat or issue for the vessel or its occupants.The disruption was brief, and the yacht’s opulent ambiance quickly returned as the officers wrapped up their work.The surprise inspection came on the heels of a festive holiday season for Bezos and Sánchez. The couple had recently celebrated in Aspen, Colorado, where their extravagant gatherings fueled rumors of a $600 million New Year’s Eve wedding. These speculations were promptly dismissed by Bezos himself, who took to X (formerly Twitter) to refute the claims.“This whole thing is completely false—none of this is happening,” Bezos posted. “The old adage ‘don’t believe everything you read’ is even more true today than ever. Lies can get ALL the way around the world before the truth can get its pants on.”Despite Bezos’ firm denial, their time in Aspen was far from low-profile. High-profile guests, including Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, were seen leaving Matsuhisa, a well-known sushi hotspot tied to the wedding rumors. Additionally, actor Kevin Costner and singer Jennifer Lopez were spotted mingling with attendees during the celebrations.Koru, named after a Māori word symbolising new beginnings, is one of the most expensive and luxurious yachts in the world. The 417-foot vessel boasts state-of-the-art features, including a swimming pool, a helicopter landing pad, and lavish accommodations for its passengers. The yacht’s size and splendor make it a regular feature in discussions about billionaire indulgences.The customs inspection near St. Barts highlighted not just the vessel’s prominence but also the scrutiny that often accompanies the lives of the ultra-wealthy.","Jeff Bezos' $500 million yacht, Koru, was raided by customs officials near St. Barts on New Year's Eve.

WWE Changed SmackDown Opening Segment Featuring Drew McIntyre and Cody Rhodes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/wwe-changed-smackdown-opening-segment-featuring-drew-mcintyre-and-cody-rhodes/articleshow/116973463.cms,"Credits: WWE

SmackDown’s Opening Segment was Supposed to Feature Kevin Owens Cutting a Promo

Full SmackDown highlights: Jan. 3, 2025

The first three-hour episode of SmackDown aired on January 3rd, 2025, live from Phoenix, Arizona. This was a big step for WWE as SmackDown has been two hours long ever since it debuted back in 1999. During the opening segment, we saw Drew McIntyre and Cody Rhodes cut promos before Kevin Owens showed up and landed a sneak attack on the Undisputed WWE Champion. However, this wasn’t always the plan as per a new report.Continue reading to learn more about what the original plan was for the latest edition of SmackDown.As revealed by PWInsider’s Mike Johnson, the creative team went back and forth while trying to decide the opening segment for their first-ever three-hour SmackDown. He said, “There were a lot of late revisions to the opening segment of Friday Night Smackdown tonight. Originally, the segment was designed to open with a Kevin Owens promo that would see Drew McIntyre and Cody Rhodes get involved.”He further added, “There was a lot of bouncing back and forth on what would best for everyone involved creatively and they landed on the version that played out. There was even talk of Jey Uso being involved at one point before they went into a different direction.” Over the past couple of months, every Kevin Owens preview has led to a lot of criticism for the WWE since Owens himself is an anti-authority figure at the moment.ALSO READ: Triple H Teases Iconic Appearance for WWE RAW's Netflix Event So, the decision to have Cody Rhodes and Drew McIntyre open SmackDown seems like a good one. Thought, it was quite interesting that the creative team was planning on including Jey Uso in the mix. The former Intercontinental Champion and Drew McIntyre have never seen eye-to-eye, so having him there would have undoubtedly incited a brawl. Ultimately, it wouldn’t have mattered since Kevin Owens was already waiting to crash Rhodes and McIntyre’s party.What do you think of WWE’s decision to have Drew McIntyre and Rhodes open the first-ever three-hour SmackDown?
