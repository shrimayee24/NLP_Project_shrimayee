Harry Bolz Meaning: Elon Musk changes his X (formerly Twitter) profile name to Harry Bolz: What does it mean?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-changes-ex-name-to-harry-bolz-what-does-it-mean/articleshow/118146142.cms,"What Does Harry Bōlz Mean?

April 2023: The ‘Harry Bōlz’ Incident

December 2024: ‘Kekius Maximus’ and Internet Subcultures

Why Does Musk Change His Name?

Humour and Entertainment – Many of Musk’s social media antics, including his name changes, seem intended to amuse both himself and his audience.

Cultural References – He frequently taps into online trends and memes, demonstrating his awareness of internet subcultures.

Disruptive Marketing – By generating discussions around his name changes, Musk keeps attention on his X profile and maintains engagement with his audience.

Elon Musk changed his X account name to Harry Bōlz on Tuesday, marking the second time he has adopted this alias. The billionaire had briefly used the same handle in April 2023. His latest stunt comes just hours after reports emerged that a Musk-led consortium of investors has placed a bid to take control of OpenAI.The 53-year-old, who heads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is currently making cuts across multiple federal agencies in an effort to reduce government spending.Musk likely used the name as a play on words, referencing the slang term ‘hairy balls’. While the reason behind his latest name change remains unclear, Musk previously explained the joke in a tweet back in 2023.Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur and owner of X (formerly Twitter), is well known for his unpredictable and often humorous online behaviour. Among his many quirks is a habit of changing his display name on the platform, sometimes as a joke and other times as a cryptic nod to internet culture. While Musk has altered his name multiple times, two notable instances stand out—his brief use of “Harry Bōlz” in April 2023 and “Kekius Maximus” in December 2024.In April 2023, Musk changed his display name on X to ""Harry Bōlz."" At the time, the reasoning behind this move was not immediately clear. However, it was widely interpreted as a joke, playing on the phonetic similarity to “hairy balls,” a slang term often used in internet humour.Musk is no stranger to wordplay and internet memes, frequently engaging in online jokes and trolling. His use of ""Harry Bōlz"" fit well within his typical approach to social media, where he enjoys posting lighthearted, and sometimes controversial, content. This name change also followed a period of heightened attention on Musk’s management of X, as he had taken over the platform in late 2022 and made several sweeping changes, including layoffs and policy updates.While Musk did not provide a detailed explanation for the name change at the time, he later addressed it in a tweet, confirming that it was indeed a joke. The name was short-lived, as Musk quickly reverted to his usual display name.On December 31, 2024, Musk once again changed his display name, this time to ""Kekius Maximus."" Alongside the name change, he updated his profile picture to an image of Pepe the Frog dressed as a Roman gladiator.The term ""Kekius Maximus"" is a reference to ""kek,"" a term popularised in online gaming and internet meme culture. Originating from World of Warcraft, ""kek"" became associated with internet communities, particularly those engaged in political memes and satire. The name ""Maximus"" is a reference to ancient Roman culture, evoking the title of a powerful general or emperor.By adopting ""Kekius Maximus,"" Musk was making a playful nod to these internet subcultures. The move sparked discussion among his followers, as some saw it as a lighthearted joke, while others speculated that Musk was aligning himself with certain meme-driven online movements. His use of Pepe the Frog, a character that has been widely used in memes across different communities, added another layer of interpretation to his display name change.Musk's tendency to change his display name on X aligns with his broader online persona. He has often embraced internet culture, meme humour, and trolling, using X as a platform to engage with his followers in an informal and often unpredictable manner. His name changes appear to serve multiple purposes:",Elon Musk changed his X account name to Harry Bōlz on Tuesday. The billionaire had briefly used the same handle in April 2023.

Kanye West lies to agency to run antisemitic ad selling swastika t-shirt during Super Bowl: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kanye-west-lies-to-agency-to-run-antisemitic-ad-selling-swastika-t-shirt-during-super-bowl-report/articleshow/118189567.cms,"Kanye West and his t-shirt controversy took a new turn with the reports indicating that the rapper reportedly lied to an advertising agency to run an antisemitic ad during the Super Bowl, which ultimately promoted offensive merchandise on his website after airing.The advertisement, lasting 15 seconds and featuring West in a dental chair, was initially presented as promoting dental work and directing viewers to Yeezy.com for standard merchandise, as reported by the Wall Street Journal.Following the advertisement's broadcast at approximately 9.30 pm ET across selected markets, including Fox affiliates in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Atlanta and a Nexstar-owned station in St. Louis, the website's content was altered to display offensive Nazi imagery.USIM, the responsible advertising agency, had submitted the commercial to television stations the previous Thursday, providing assurance of content review New York Post reported.Fox and Nexstar executives' preliminary website checks revealed only standard athletic apparel available for purchase.West, now known as Ye, posted inflammatory antisemitic content on X prior to the Super Bowl. His account was subsequently banned following these posts.Along with that Shopify terminated the Yeezy online store on Tuesday, citing policy violations and inauthentic commerce practices.Amidst all the controversy, his talent agency 33 & West ditched Kanye and agent Daniel McCartney took to Instagram Stories, saying, ""Effective immediately, I am no longer representing YE (F/K/A Kanye West) due to his recent harmful and hateful remarks that myself nor 33 & West can stand for,' McCartney said. 'Peace and love to all'.""USIM's president Doug Livingston confirmed their prior vetting revealed no concerning content. The agency, hired recently by Yeezy LLC executives, ended their partnership on Friday following West's social media posts.Regional Super Bowl advertisements operate under different approval protocols than national commercials, which require Fox and NFL authorisation.The NFL issued a statement Tuesday denouncing antisemitism and clarifying their non-involvement in the advertisement's approval or broadcast.Regional advertisement slots offer a more economical alternative to national Super Bowl commercials, which can cost up to $8 million for 30 seconds. In Los Angeles, local slots were priced at approximately $1 million.The incident prompted immediate criticism from organisations including the Anti-Defamation League and American Jewish Committee, with public figures demanding West's removal from X.This episode adds to West's history of antisemitic statements, which has resulted in terminated partnerships with brands including Adidas and Gap.His previous X suspension in 2022 for posting offensive imagery was followed by reinstatement in mid-2023, though with restrictions on monetisation and advertisement placement.","The 15-second ad was initially presented as promoting dental work and directing viewers to Yeezy.com for standard merchandise.

Al-Nuri Mosque: Iraq’s leaning 'hunchback' minaret rises again after years in ruins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iraqs-leaning-hunchback-minaret-rises-again-after-years-in-ruins/articleshow/117977421.cms,"The Al-Hadba minaret in Mosul, Iraq, has been rebuilt, restoring its historic presence after being destroyed during ISIS rule. Known as the ""hunchback"" minaret, it earned its name due to its leaning shape.Unesco spearheaded the restoration of this architectural marvel, which stands as part of the Al-Nuri Mosque , utilising original brickwork in the reconstruction process.Abdullah Mahmoud from Iraq's antiquities department expressed the significance: ""Al-Hadba is our identity, and restoring it means the city has reclaimed its identity"". The 12th-century structure maintains its distinctive 160-centimetre lean, identical to its tilt in the 1960.The Al-Nuri Mosque, where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed his self-styled caliphate in July 2014, was razed in June 2017 during Mosul's liberation battle. Iraqi officials stated that IS forces planted explosives before withdrawing.The five-year Unesco restoration incorporated 26,000 original bricks for the exterior, with 96,000 new bricks added internally for structural support. The foundation received additional reinforcement to stabilise the tilt.The restoration effort extended to the mosque's columns, dome and courtyard. The mihrab was restored using original stonework, whilst the minbar required substantial reconstruction due to missing original components.Former muezzin Imad Zaki observes the restoration daily, stating: ""Every day I stand here for an hour to watch as they are restored to their original state. Today one can feel the spirituality. It's as if our souls have finally found peace.""Unesco's broader restoration initiative includes the Al-Tahira Church from 1862, featuring reconstructed arcades, pillars and stained-glass windows. Archaeological discoveries include an underground cellar and wine vessels, now displayed beneath glass flooring.Unesco Iraq's senior project manager Maria Acetoso noted the transformation: ""When I arrived here in 2019, it looked like a ghost city. In five years plus, there has been a massive change.""Despite progress, Mosul's recovery continues. The clearance of 12,000 tonnes of debris was necessary for landmark restoration, whilst numerous neighbourhoods remain damaged.In the Old City, buildings marked 'safe' in red indicate explosive clearance. Many former inhabitants, particularly Christians, await return.Mohammed Kassem, now residing in a new dwelling, believes the city requires further reconstruction and the return of its original residents, particularly the Christian community.Saad Mohammed, 65, residing opposite Al-Nuri Mosque, recounts the IS period: ""We opened the window once and saw the black IS flag on top of the minaret. Then we opened it again, and the minaret was gone."" Now, with restored landmarks, he remarks, ""Today the minaret has risen again. Now we feel safe.""","Unesco spearheaded the restoration of the Al-Hadba minaret in Mosul, Iraq.

Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic. In his memoir, Spare, the Duke of Sussex talks about reaching out to a medium with supernatural abilities to communicate with Diana, who passed away in a car accident in Paris in 1997, just before his 13th birthday, The Mirror reported.The Duke received a message from his mother through the psychic, who told him, ""You're living the life she wanted for you."" Harry, now 40, says that the medium also told him his mother was with him ""right now,"" which made his neck warm and his eyes fill with tears. The psychic shared that Diana knew Harry was ""looking for clarity"" and ""feels your confusion."" She added that Diana understood Harry had ""so many questions"" and that answers would come in time.Another anecdote involved Prince Harry’s son, Archie. The psychic reportedly described how Diana’s spirit witnessed Archie accidentally breaking a Christmas tree ornament shaped like Queen Elizabeth. When asked, Harry admitted the incident had occurred, adding that Archie had attempted to fix the ornament.The medium suggested Diana found humour in the situation, delighting in the antics of her grandson she never had the chance to meet.In Spare, Prince Harry also recounts an extraordinary encounter with a leopard during a trip to Botswana with his brother, Prince William. He interpreted the animal’s presence as a comforting sign from his late mother, suggesting that ""everything will be fine."" However, the experience was not without fear, as he briefly worried the leopard might attack.Harry has been candid about the psychological toll of losing Diana so young. As reported by The Mirror, he disclosed a haunting period after her death when he entertained the possibility that she had staged her demise. His anguish led him to repeatedly drive through the Paris tunnel where Diana’s life was cut short, attempting to make sense of the tragedy.","Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Google Maps has become an indispensable tool for millions of people worldwide, offering accurate navigation and helping users seamlessly move from one destination to another. But how does Google manage to deliver such precise routes and real-time updates? The answer lies in a sophisticated blend of data collection, artificial intelligence (AI), and real-time analysis. By leveraging a wide array of data sources—ranging from satellite imagery to GPS data from smartphones—Google Maps continuously refines its navigation capabilities to provide users with the most reliable routes and traffic updates.Beyond simple directions, Google Maps integrates features like real-time traffic alerts, weather conditions, and personalized recommendations, making it an all-encompassing navigation tool. With the integration of AI technologies such as Gemini and the continuous evolution of machine learning algorithms, Google Maps is not just helping people find the fastest route but also offering contextual information that enhances the entire travel experience.One of the foundational components of Google Maps is its use of satellite imagery. High-resolution images from satellites provide a bird’s-eye view of the world, allowing Google to map streets, landmarks, natural features, and urban developments accurately. This data is frequently updated to reflect changes such as new roads, construction zones, and infrastructure developments.In addition to satellite images, Google employs aerial photography captured from aircraft to enhance the granularity of the data. This dual approach ensures that both urban and rural areas are mapped with high accuracy. Google Maps relies heavily on GPS data from millions of smartphones worldwide. As users navigate with Google Maps, anonymized location data is transmitted back to Google, allowing the system to analyze traffic flow, vehicle speed, and road conditions in real-time. This crowdsourced data is invaluable in providing up-to-the-minute traffic updates, identifying congested areas, and suggesting alternate routes.In many urban centers, traffic cameras and sensors installed along roads provide real-time visuals and data on traffic conditions. Google integrates this data to offer users accurate traffic reports, including details about accidents, construction work, and road closures.Google’s Local Guides program plays a significant role in refining map accuracy. With over 300 million local guides contributing reviews, photos, and updates, Google Maps can offer detailed insights into businesses, landmarks, and public spaces. Additionally, users can report changes in road layouts, business openings or closings, and temporary obstructions, ensuring that the maps remain up-to-date.Artificial Intelligence has revolutionised how Google Maps processes and delivers data. By using machine learning algorithms, Google can analyze vast amounts of information from multiple sources and provide real-time updates. This AI-driven approach ensures that maps are constantly updated with the latest information, such as newly constructed roads, traffic accidents, and road hazards.In October 2024, Google introduced a transformative feature by integrating its generative AI chatbot, Gemini, into Google Maps. This feature allows users to conduct highly specific searches, such as “dog-friendly sports bars with outdoor seating and TVs”, offering a more personalized navigation experience. Gemini analyzes reviews, photos, and location data to provide tailored recommendations based on users' preferences.Google Maps now includes immersive weather updates along users' routes, enhancing the navigation experience. Users can see real-time weather forecasts, including rainfall, snow conditions, and extreme weather warnings, which help in planning safe and efficient travel. Additionally, users receive alerts about bad road conditions, flood-prone areas, and accident hotspots, ensuring they are well-informed before and during their journey.Google Maps utilises Large Language Models (LLMs) to process information from over 250 million places globally. These models allow the platform to understand user queries more effectively and deliver precise search results. Whether users are searching for nearby restaurants, gas stations, or tourist attractions, the AI models analyze data from various sources to offer relevant suggestions.For example, if a user searches for “best vegan cafes near me”, Google Maps will not only list the nearest options but also provide ratings, reviews, and photos contributed by other users, giving a comprehensive view of each location.Google Maps’ integration with Google Earth offers users a more immersive experience, allowing them to visualize locations in 3D and explore terrain features in detail. This is particularly useful for hikers, urban planners, and real estate professionals who need an in-depth view of specific areas.As AI continues to evolve, Google Maps aims to provide even more personalized navigation experiences. By analyzing user behavior, preferences, and historical data, Google Maps can suggest routes and destinations that align with individual needs. For instance, frequent commuters may receive updates on traffic patterns specific to their daily routes, while travelers might get recommendations for scenic drives or tourist attractions.Future developments will likely include enhanced safety features, such as real-time hazard detection and predictive traffic modeling. These tools can alert users to potential dangers, such as sharp turns, steep inclines, or sudden weather changes, improving overall road safety.Google Maps is also focusing on promoting sustainable transportation. The platform already offers eco-friendly routing options, which suggest routes that minimize fuel consumption and carbon emissions. Future updates may include more robust features to support electric vehicle (EV) users, such as real-time charging station availability and battery optimization routes.","Artificial Intelligence has revolutionised how Google Maps processes and delivers data. By using machine learning algorithms, Google can analyze vast amounts of information from multiple sources and provide real-time updates. This AI-driven approach ensures that maps are constantly updated with the latest information, such as newly constructed roads and road hazards.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118187890,imgsize-14504,width-400,resizemode-4/118187890.jpg"

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.

Hacker claims access to 20 million-plus ChatGPT access codes: What ChatGPT users should do right away,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/hacker-claims-access-to-20-million-plus-chatgpt-access-codes-what-chatgpt-users-should-do-right-away/articleshow/118180057.cms,"How this alleged data breach can affect users



What ChatGPT users should do



A cybercriminal has reportedly put 20 million OpenAI user login credentials and samples of the stolen data up for sale. The hacker known as ""emirking"" has issued a statement that claims that the cybercriminal may have found a way to bypass the platform's authentication systems, potentially by exploiting a vulnerability or obtaining administrator credentials. This raises concerns about the security of OpenAI user accounts.In the statement, (translated from Russian by Malwarebytes), the hacker said: ““When I realized that OpenAI might have to verify accounts in bulk, I understood that my password wouldn’t stay hidden. I have more than 20 million access codes to OpenAI accounts. If you want, you can contact me—this is a treasure.”According to a report by Malwarebytes, such a large number of credentials may not have been harvested solely through phishing attacks on users. However, If the hacker's claim is accurate, Emirking may have discovered a way to compromise the auth0.openai.com subdomain, either by exploiting a vulnerability or by obtaining administrator credentials. However, OpenAI has to yet to officially address the hacker’s claims.Stolen OpenAI credentials could potentially allow cyber criminals to access sensitive user information, leading to targeted phishing campaigns and financial fraud. Additionally, the credentials could be used to exploit the OpenAI API , forcing victims to pay for unauthorized usage of premium features. However, some users on the dark web forum where the credentials were shared have claimed that they do not provide access to ChatGPT conversation history.Users are advised to change their passwords, enable multi-factor authentication and monitor their accounts for any suspicious activity. It is also important to be vigilant against phishing attempts that may leverage stolen information.BreachForums, the dark web platform where the credentials were reportedly offered, is currently offline, preventing immediate verification of the claims. However, users can also utilise online tools like Malwarebyte’s Digital Footprint scan to check for exposed personal data.","A cybercriminal has reportedly put 20 million OpenAI user login credentials and samples of the stolen data up for sale.

Grok 3

(expected, tbd)

Claude 3.5 Sonnet

DeepSeek

GPT-4o

Grok 2

Gemini 2.0 Pro Series (might be higher, will probably move up)

What the xAI engineer said

I resigned from xAI tonight.

It makes me very sad, but was the right thing to do -- and here's why.

xAI told me I either had to delete the post quoted below, or face being fired.

After reviewing everything and thinking a lot, I've decided that I'm not going to delete the post -- which is very clearly a harmless personal opinion.

Why did they tell me to remove this opinion? Well, according to them, the reason is that I acknowledged that Grok 3... exists.

I wish I was joking. I'm not. That's the reason -- the fact that I wrote ""Grok 3 (TBD)"" is grounds for being fired.

But wait, hasn't Grok 3 been officially acknowledged by xAI? Yes. Yes it has.

AI engineer takes swipe at Musk

An AI engineer at Elon Musk-owned xAI has resigned after he claimed that he was asked to delete a post he says contained a “harmless personal opinion”, on X (formerly Twitter). Benjamin De Kraker said he was given an ultimatum: delete the tweet or be fired.The post in question is essentially a personal ranking of AI models, which included a mention of “Grok 3 (expected, tbd),” referring to xAI's upcoming model.Apart from giving the reason for his resignation in a long post, De Kraker claims xAI considered even this acknowledgment of Grok 3's existence a violation of company policy. He further pointed out the absurdity of the situation, noting that both xAI and Musk had publicly discussed Grok 3's development on numerous occasions, even sharing official posts about the model.De Kraker expressed disappointment that a company ostensibly championing free speech would take such action against an employee for a clearly labeled opinion.“It's very disappointing to me that a company and leaders who supposedly champion free speech and openness would try to fire a low-level employee over a clearly-labeled opinion that contains absolutely nothing controversial, but here we are,” he said.Despite his frustration, De Kraker wished xAI and Musk well, praising the team he worked with. He mentioned a specific feature of Grok he worked on, expressing hope for its success, but declined to provide details, citing “actual confidential information.”","An AI engineer at Elon Musk-owned xAI has resigned after he was asked to delete a post he says contained a “harmless personal opinion”, on X (formerly Twitter) Benjamin De Kraker said he was given an ultimatum: delete the tweet or be fired.
