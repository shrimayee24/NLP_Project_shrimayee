He started with an appeal to people to ""Stop calling on Biden to step down or to be forced out.That will just give Kamala all the benefits of running as an incumbent US President. And she won’t be any better for America in the next 5 months than Biden will be.""He also called to stop attacking Kamala over imprisoning people. ""Stop attacking Kamala for locking up too many people as a prosecutor.

And if we say things that don’t make sense, we will lose votes.""Explaining the reasoning for the appeals, he said, ""Our biggest risk isn’t that voters will suddenly fall in love with Kamala. She didn’t even make it to her own party’s Iowa caucus because voters didn’t like her, *despite* fake enthusiasm the media tried to generate around her even back then.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

What are Phi-3 models

Microsoft has announced several updates related to its own Phi-3 generative AI (GenAI) models as well as Azure cloud. The company says that developers can now quickly create customised AI solutions with its own small models and leverage the Azure cloud platform to access other AI models offered by companies like Meta – the parent organisation of Facebook and Instagram .“Developing and deploying AI applications at scale requires a robust and flexible platform that can handle the complex and diverse needs of modern enterprises and allow them to create solutions grounded in their organisational data,” Microsoft said on announcing updates.Microsoft said that it provides serverless fine-tuning for Phi-3-mini and Phi-3-medium models to enable developers to quickly and easily customise the models for cloud and edge scenarios without having to arrange for computation.The company also announced updates to the Phi-3-mini AI model including improvement in core quality, instruction-following, and structured output.

Why WhatsApp is less popular in the US



Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced that WhatsApp has reached a milestone of 100 million monthly active users in the US. The messaging app has seen rapid growth in major cities like Los Angeles, New York, Miami, and Seattle. Moreover, WhatsApp also reported “significant growth” in users in Southern US states, with Texas surpassing 10 million users.In a press release (seen by The Verge), WhatsApp spokesperson Ashley O’Reilly wrote: “This is the first time data pertaining to users has been released since Meta’s acquisition of the messaging app and demonstrates how the messaging platform, already the biggest messaging app in the world, has experienced tremendous growth in the US.”In 2014, social media giant Facebook (now Meta) purchased WhatsApp for $16 billion.Since then, the company has been putting efforts into making the app as popular in the US as it is outside the country.One such way was by advertising WhatsApp’s availability on iOS and Android , focusing particularly on how easy it is to message users across platforms. iPhones don’t need to switch from iMessage to SMS as WhatsApp messages from Androids don’t show up as green bubbles with lower-quality images, removed encryption, and shortened messages.Recently, WhatsApp also captured attention when it reunited the cast of Modern Family for an ad promoting this very feature to families.WhatsApp now boasts more than 2 billion users in over 180 countries, yet it’s still less popular in the US than rivals like Apple’s iMessage. While it may have experienced growth in the US, it’s going to be even harder for WhatsApp to compete once Apple replaces Rich Communication Services (RCS) as the communication protocol between Android and iOS devices.RCS support will be coming to iOS 18 this fall, after which iPhone users won’t need to switch to WhatsApp for group chats.","WhatsApp has reached a milestone of 100 million monthly active users in the US.

The Undertaker is undead

Undertaker makes his entrance: WrestleMania 27

While the action that we get to see in the WWE ring looks very realistic, most of it, including the promos and all the brutal fights are actually scripted, and made to fit in a storyline. Now, over the years, thanks to these storylines, a lot of rumors have cropped up surrounding some of the most popular wrestlers in the industry.These rumors are a result of the persona that the individuals carry around themselves in the ring.From secret societies to aliens (yes, you read that right), conspiracy theorists have left no stone unturned when it comes to creating rumors about the wrestlers in the company.Glenn Jacobs, the current Mayor of Knox county, was a part of the Brothers of Destruction stable where he paired up with The Undertaker . During the early years of his wrestling career, he used to wear a mask to the ring to hide his identity. From theories of his face getting burned in the flames of hell to him being involved in a fire accident, there were a lot of rumors about why he wore a mask.At this point, everyone knows and admits that Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson is the most electrifying personality in the world of professional wrestling. However, given his charisma and his in-ring presence, there were rumors that The Rock was an undercover agent, a CIA agent to be precise, who had infiltrated the WWE and was gathering information. What this information was is anyone’s guess, but if this rumor were to be true, he’d have vanished a long time ago.Vince McMohan has been portrayed as one of the most evil individuals in the world of professional wrestling. From lawsuits to numerous accusations, the man has seen it all. We won’t go into the details of these accusations for now, but everyone will agree that he fits the character of a villain perfectly. All this combined lead to a belief that he ran a cult or a secret society that controlled the entire professional wrestling world. This is probably the only rumor on this list that is actually believable, because everyone for some reason, loves secret societies.Given his persona and physique, fans assumed that Hulk Hogan was an alien. We don’t know how this came to be because there are a lot of other individuals, in the world of professional wrestling and outside that have a similar physique and structure. But for some weird reason Hulk Hogan was associated with extraterrestrial life, and some even believe it to be true even to this day.The Undertaker’s character was created with the aura of mysticism in mind. So as he went through his different personalities of darkness, rumors like him being able to control the weather, or coming back to life after dying seven times or even being a real life Warlock, are really common rumors that you will get to here. But unlike the others mentioned on the list, these rumors worked in his favor because it added more depth to his dark and gloomy character.Also read: Ranking every Bloodline member from worst to best","The Rock was an undercover agent, a CIA agent to be precise, who had infiltrated the WWE and was gathering information.

She shared, “I had a lot of demons in my younger life and I still do now. We were still the 'let me up' match, we were still doing bikini contests instead of wrestling, we were still doing dance contests instead of wrestling.""Speaking about her eating disorders, she added, ""I think, with having an eating disorder — pre-existing eating disorder — I think just fanned the flames.""

I grew up; I think WWE had me grow up in a lot of ways.""Diaz also went on to describe, ""Sometimes you're not the look, and sometimes you're not what they're looking for and that's just like, 'Eh, c'est la vie, it's showbusiness, baby.'"" She further added, ""You know, you're not thin enough –- or for me, like a mid-size person, who — I'm not particularly very thin, and I'm also not so like tall or super, super buff or fit. You were either the model or you were the monster.""Raquel Diaz had big shoes to fill for her father Eddie Guerrero, many fans had wanted her to rise to the occasion. However, Diaz believed that she could never live up to her father’s legacy, because there couldn’t be another Eddie Guerrero.","Raquel Diaz, one of the three daughters of Eddie Guerrero followed his path and ventured into sports.
