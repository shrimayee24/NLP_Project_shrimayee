NYC bystander recounts terrifying moment she was shot, ‘I looked down and there’s a hole’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-alia-abdul-raheem-nyc-bystander-recounts-terrifying-moment-she-was-shot-i-looked-down-and-theres-a-hole/articleshow/117298063.cms,"Representative Image

The ordinary walk home turned into a nightmare for 32-year-old Alia Abdul-Raheem , who was struck by a stray bullet during an apparent drive-by shooting in Brooklyn on Tuesday evening. The chilling experience left her physically sore, mentally shaken, and calling for stricter gun control.Abdul-Raheem, who works at a record label, was walking along Malcolm X Boulevard toward her Bedford-Stuyvesant home around 7 pm when the sound of gunfire shattered the evening calm.“I looked up and I saw a car driving by pretty fast, and the windows were down, and it sounds like the gunshots are coming from the car,” Abdul-Raheem told the New York Post the following day.Moments later, she felt the unthinkable.“I just felt this, like this hit on my chest, and I looked down, and there’s a hole in my coat, through my shirt,” she recalled.In shock, Abdul-Raheem hurried home, trying to process what had just happened.“At the time, I couldn’t feel any blood. I didn’t really know what had just happened. I was just in pain and kind of shocked, and I continued to walk home.”When she arrived, her sister’s reaction confirmed the severity of the situation.“My sister opened up my coat and she could see the big gash and wounds on my chest,” she said.Abdul-Raheem rushed to New York Presbyterian’s emergency room, where medical staff acted swiftly. Fortunately, the bullet had only grazed her chest, leaving her shaken but alive.“All things considered,” the doctor told her, “it could have been really a lot worse.”The same gunfire also struck a 15-year-old boy, who police believe was the intended target. He was hit in the left ankle on Chauncey Street near Malcolm X Boulevard and is currently in stable condition.The incident has left Abdul-Raheem, who has lived in the neighborhood for eight years, feeling uneasy about her once-familiar commute.“It’s scary. I’m a bit shaken up,” she admitted, adding that walking the same route will be difficult for a while.She also expressed frustration and sadness over the broader implications of the violence.“The kid who was shot was 15. I could tell the kids were young. They don’t even know what they’re doing — why [do they have] guns?” she asked.“It was 7 o’clock on a Tuesday. If we had better gun control, this would have never happened.”Police have made no arrests as of Thursday morning. The investigation into the shooting remains ongoing.For Abdul-Raheem, the incident is a stark reminder of how quickly life can change — and a call for action to address gun violence in the city.","Alia Abdul-Raheem, 32, was struck by a stray bullet during an apparent drive-by shooting in Brooklyn on Tuesday evening.

Poll What Do You Think About Hindenburg Research Shutting Down? Surprising Decision After Major Revelations A Bold Move After a History of Impactful Reports

Why has Hindenburg Research shut down?

Below is the full text of his personal note:

As I’ve shared with family, friends and our team since late last year, I have made the decision to disband Hindenburg Research. The plan has been to wind up after we finished the pipeline of ideas we were working on. And as of the last Ponzi cases we just completed and are sharing with regulators, that day is today.

I write this from a place of joy. Building this has been a life’s dream.

I did not know at the outset if it would be possible to find a fulfilling path. This wasn’t an easy option, but I was naïve to the danger and felt drawn to it magnetically.

When I started this, I doubted I was capable. I didn’t have a traditional finance background. None of my relatives are in this field. I went to a state school. I’m not a slick salesperson. I don’t know any of the right clothes to wear. I can’t play golf. I’m not some superhuman that can function on 4 hours of sleep. In most of my jobs I was a good worker but mostly looked over. I had no money when I started—and after catching 3 lawsuits immediately out of the gate, I quickly had less than no money. I would have failed right at the starting line had it not been for the support of world-class whistleblower lawyer Bryan Wood, who took the cases on despite my lack of financial resources. I had a newborn child and was facing eviction at the time. I was terrified, but knew that if I stayed still I would crumble. The only option I had was to keep moving forward.

It is very easy to succumb to negative thoughts and believe what others think of you, especially when things feel low. But it is possible to shatter all of that. I was passionate about this and I let that carry me forward despite my fears and insecurities.

And then this slowly started to flourish.

One at a time, and without a clear plan, we built a team of 11 incredible people. I hired each of them not because we needed workers, but because when our paths crossed and I could see who they were, I realized it was madness not to bring them on.

They are all smart, focused, and fun to work with. Little to no ego. When you meet them, they are all very nice and polite. But when it comes to this field, they are ruthless assassins, capable of world-class work. Like me, our team didn’t come from traditional finance backgrounds. My first hire often describes himself as a former bartender. We all have a shared view of the world, a mostly calm exterior, and a similar burning underlying intensity. They are all family to me.

We have all worked extremely hard, with a focus on precision and letting the evidence dictate our words.

Sometimes this meant taking big swings and taking on fights that are much bigger than any of us as individuals. Fraud, corruption, and negativity often seem overwhelming. Early on, a sense of justice was usually elusive. When it happened, it was tremendously fulfilling. It kept us going when we needed it.

And boy did we have an impact, eventually—more than I imagined was possible at the outset. Nearly 100 individuals have been charged civilly or criminally by regulators at least in part through our work, including billionaires and oligarchs. We shook some empires that we felt needed shaking.

Over time, people began to see what I hoped we could show—that having an impact is possible, no matter who you are.

It has also been rather intense, and at times, all-encompassing. I often wake up from my dreams because I’ve thought of a new investigative thread to pull on in my sleep, or an edit that clarifies a point I didn’t realize I was troubled by during the day. Or from the general pressure of it all. We are not fearless—we just have faith in the truth and hope it leads us down the right path.

I’m grateful for all of it. We have days of bizarre, hilarious and ridiculous stories and we’ve had a lot of fun amidst the pressure and challenges. It has been the adventure of a lifetime.

So, why disband now? There is not one specific thing—no particular threat, no health issue, and no big personal issue.

Someone once told me that at a certain point a successful career becomes a selfish act. Early on, I felt I needed to prove some things to myself. I have now finally found some comfort with myself, probably for the first time in my life. I probably could have had it all along had I let myself, but I needed to put myself through a bit of hell first. The intensity and focus has come at the cost of missing a lot of the rest of the world and the people I care about. I now view Hindenburg as a chapter in my life, not a central thing that defines me.

Beyond my own desire for relief, it also feels selfish to keep the knowledge we’ve accumulated trapped within our small team. I have more than enough. In the past several years we’ve been flooded with thousands of messages from many of you asking how we do what we do, or whether you can join the team. I read them all and I’ve been trying to figure out how to respond in a way that can answer everyone—so over the next 6 months or so I plan to work on a series of materials and videos to open-source every aspect of our model and how we conduct our investigations.

My hope is that after we fully share our process, in a couple years I will get an unsolicited message from someone who reads this (maybe you), who embraces the same passion, learns the craft, and finds the confidence to shed some light on a subject that needs it, despite the obstacles in your way. That would make my day, even if I’m off trying to learn music or planting a garden or whatever I end up doing next.

For now, I will be focused on making sure everyone on our team lands where they want to be next. Some are going to start their own research firm, which I will strongly and publicly encourage, even as I will have no personal involvement. There are others on our team who are now free agents—so feel free to reach out to me if you have a need for anyone who is brilliant, focused, and easy to work with, as they all are.

It wasn’t always obvious to me, but I now view all of this as a love story. To my wife, you have been so patient with me. It has not been easy, to put it mildly, and I am forever grateful that you have sacrificed so much and pushed forward with me. And now, my dear, we get to enjoy it together for as long as this world will let us.

To my family and friends, I’m sorry for the times I have ignored you while I let my attention be drawn away. I can’t wait to have more time to share with you together.

Lastly, I want to express how grateful I am to our readers. Your messages of kindness and encouragement through the years have gone a long way to help give us the strength to continue. And it constantly reminds me that the world is filled with good. Thank you for all of it—I couldn’t ask for more. It is all a blessing.

With unfathomable levels of gratitude,

Nate Anderson","Hindenburg Research shut down after more than a year of work.

Pope Francis’ new autobiography traces roots and rise to Vatican

Pope Francis in his recently released autobiography, ""Hope: The Autobiography,"" opened up about his youth, describing himself as a ""mischievous child.""At 88, the Pope reflected on moments of mischief and regret from his childhood in Buenos Aires, admitting, ""I remember my sins and I am ashamed… I am a sinner like everyone else,"" as reported by AFP.The Pope delved into his family’s immigrant history, sharing the story of his Italian grandparents who moved to Argentina in 1929.With only third-class boat tickets, his grandmother had to hide her possessions in the lining of her jacket. He reflected on this, saying, “There’s nothing new about it. It’s a story of yesterday as much as one of today,” drawing a parallel to the ongoing struggles of migrants.He also shared his surprise at being elected Pope in 2013, admitting that he never imagined himself in this role. Reflecting on the day he was chosen, he wrote, “I had never imagined that the conclave could affect me directly, and in no way could I have thought about a name as pope.”Pope Francis, who has not watched TV since 1990 due to a vow made to the Virgen del Carmen, also revealed the small sacrifices he’s made as Pope, including missing out on watching his favourite football team, San Lorenzo.""That evening I was with my community in Buenos Aires, we were watching the TV, and a sordid scene appeared on the screen, which deeply offended me: I got up and left,"" he said.“Going out for a pizza is one of the small things that I most miss,” he added highlighting the everyday joys he once enjoyed, such as walking the streets and taking the subway.","Pope Francis has released his autobiography, ""Hope: The Autobiography"" The Pope opened up about his youth, describing himself as a ""mischievous child"" He also shared his family's immigrant history, saying, ""It's a story of yesterday as much as one of today""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117250764,imgsize-871386,width-400,resizemode-4/117250764.jpg"

Sound and video of meteorite crashing to Earth captured on video in P.E.I.

For the first time, a doorbell camera has captured both the sight and sound of a meteorite striking the Earth, marking a significant milestone in scientific documentation.In July 2024, Joe Velaidum and his partner, Laura Kelly, witnessed the extraordinary event outside their home in Marshfield, Prince Edward Island, according to CBC News.Velaidum’s Ring camera recorded the meteorite's fiery descent and audible impact as it struck the ground just steps from his front door, leaving a dent in the walkway and scattering debris.The meteorite, later identified as an ordinary chondrite, travelled from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter before its fateful collision.After discovering black debris on his property, Velaidum consulted University of Alberta meteorite curator Chris Herd. As per CBC News, Herd confirmed the rock’s extraterrestrial origins and named it the Charlottetown Meteorite , honouring its proximity to the island's capital. In total, 95 grams of fragments were collected, with analysis revealing the rock’s high-speed entry, approximately 60,000 km/h, before slowing to 200 km/h upon impact.“This event is truly unprecedented,” CBC News quoted Herd. “It’s the first time both the sights and sounds of a meteorite impact have been captured. From a science perspective, it’s new.”The recently surfaced video not only provides extraordinary visual but also unique auditory evidence of the meteorite’s collision, a breakthrough for researchers studying these rare phenomena.Velaidum narrowly escaped harm and recounted, “If I’d lingered just minutes longer, I might’ve been standing right in the impact zone. It’s surreal to think that something travelled millions of miles to land right on my doorstep.”The event left Velaidum and Kelly in awe of the cosmos’ unpredictability. “It’s humbling,” Velaidum said, reflecting on the odds of such a close encounter.As per PetaPixel, this meteorite is the first ever documented on Prince Edward Island, adding a unique chapter to the island’s history. Herd emphasised its significance: “Every time this happens, it’s a new sample from space—a testament to the wonders of our universe.”","Sound and video of meteorite crashing to Earth captured on video in P.E.I.

She shared a touching video montage of her 'sweet' companion, who was scheduled to appear in her upcoming Netflix programme.The Duchess expressed her profound grief, acknowledging countless tears shed whilst thanking her faithful pet for years of unwavering devotion. She titled the tribute ""advocating for pet adoption with a compilation of photographs and videos.""In 2015, I adopted a beagle from a dog rescue in Canada. He had been at a kill shelter in Kentucky and given a few days to live. I swooped him up….and fell in love.

And he was the best guy any girl could have asked for,"" the mother-of-two said in her post.Meghan continued, ""He endured a terrible accident shortly before I moved to the UK which had him undergoing surgeries for several months and unable to leave the clinic.

Did UK media downplay pakistani grooming gangs scandal? Here's the truth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/did-uk-media-downplay-pakistani-grooming-gangs-scandal-heres-the-truth/articleshow/116995456.cms,"File photo

Using data to examine the issue

Stark media gap before 2011

The numbers don't lie: Grooming gangs vs other scandals

Relative neglect in the media

Cultural and political taboo

A national scandal that can't be ignored

A call for accountability

Matthew James Goodwin , a prominent British political scientist, recently questioned the media's handling of the UK's grooming gangs scandal, suggesting that it has not received sufficient coverage. His remarks sparked criticism from some journalists, but Goodwin is undeterred. He decided to take a closer look at the data to assess the media’s treatment of the issue.Goodwin used Lexis, a database employed by researchers to track content across UK newspapers, to analyze media coverage from 2011 to 2025. He made sure to account for criticisms, specifically addressing how the term ""grooming gangs"" is used in the media. His findings, he insists, will shed light on how the scandal has been covered—or neglected.One of Goodwin’s main points is that until 2011, the media largely ignored the grooming gangs crisis, despite widespread rumors and groups like the BNP and EDL pushing it into public discourse. He credited Andrew Norfolk of The Times for starting early coverage, despite facing abuse and harassment. It wasn't until 2011 that any major media outlet seriously began to report on the issue.From 2011 to 2025, Goodwin found a total of 4,659 articles about grooming gangs. On the surface, this may seem like a substantial number, but when compared to coverage of other topics, it appears minimal. For example, the term ""white privilege"" appeared in 6,146 articles, ""anti-Muslim"" in 17,152, and ""Islamophobia"" in 23,461.Goodwin points out that while there were certainly outlets that covered the grooming gangs issue, like The Times, the coverage still pales in comparison to other race-related stories. In fact, newspapers like The Guardian had only 113 articles about grooming gangs during the same period, compared to over 3,000 articles on ""Islamophobia.""The BBC’s coverage is similarly skewed. Goodwin found 357 specific mentions of grooming gangs in BBC News and Radio 4 transcripts, while George Floyd's case generated over 7,500 mentions, and ""Islamophobia"" garnered over 2,000.The political scientist believes that the relative media silence on grooming gangs can be attributed to the media’s reluctance to challenge narratives surrounding immigration, multiculturalism, and ""diversity."" He argues that these topics are too politically sensitive for much of the media to address openly, especially when they might contradict the prevailing liberal views held by the educated elites who control much of the UK’s media.In a passionate appeal, Goodwin credits Elon Musk for forcing the UK to reckon with this national scandal. Thanks to Musk’s influence, millions are now learning about the horrors of the grooming gangs for the first time or discovering new, shocking details. Goodwin believes this newfound awareness will lead the public to ask critical questions: Why was this ignored? Who is accountable? What’s being done to stop it?Goodwin concludes by urging the UK media to confront the scandal head-on. He believes the media must push the issue to the forefront, give it the attention it deserves, and avoid focusing on distractions like the death of a single American man. The British public, he argues, is paying attention, and it’s time for the media to do the same.As Goodwin puts it, “Find the truth and tell us the truth. That’s your job.”","British political scientist Matthew James Goodwin analyzed media coverage from 2011 to 2025. Goodwin found a total of 4,659 articles about grooming gangs.

The doctors initially told her the focus would be on prolonging her life rather than finding a cure.Despite the grim prediction, a combined range of treatments including chemotherapy, targeted drug therapy, and surgery helped her defy the odds leaving no signs of cancer anywhere in her body.""Within four weeks of going under the knife, I was able to drive and walk the family dogs, it was really quite incredible.” Perea shared, adding, ""To go from being told I'd only have a short time to live to now being cancer-free is the greatest gift.According to Sky News, Pera's cancer was diagnosed after she first visited a GP in Wingan, reporting symptoms of constipation and bloating. Following a series of tests, including a colonoscopy and biopsy, the diagnosis was confirmed, revealing that the cancer had spread to all eight segments of her liver.Perea underwent 37 rounds of chemotherapy with the targeted drug panitumumab, showing an excellent response that allowed surgeons to remove her bowel tumour in May 2023. However, tumours remained in her liver, which were initially inoperable. However, after the positive reaction to treatment, doctors began exploring liver transplantation as an option.In February 2024, she was added to the transplant list and fortunately found a donor last summer.Her oncologist, Dr Kalena Marti, praised the outcome, ""When we looked at the tumour cells in her liver after it had been removed, they weren't active.”""This is excellent news, and we hope that this means that the cancer won't come back.""Dr Marti also highlighted the importance of ongoing research and the generosity of organ donors. ""Advanced bowel cancer is complex and there are lots of different types of the disease, so what works for one person might not work for another. As a result, it's important that we continue to develop new treatments.","Bianca Perea, a 32-year-old trainee lawyer from Manchester, has been declared cancer-free.

I hope you love the show as much as I loved making it.""The series is set to launch on January 15, having been teased last March when Meghan launched her brand, American Riviera Orchard.As the trailer launched, royal fans didn’t seem as enthusiastic as Meghan.

Challenges in Sustaining an AI Relationship



Implications for the Future of Human-AI Interactions



In today's digital age, the quest for companionship has taken an unexpected turn. Ayrin, a 28-year-old nursing student, ventured beyond traditional relationships by customising an AI chatbot into her ideal partner. What began as a light-hearted experiment evolved into a profound emotional connection, challenging our understanding of love and technology.Ayrin's journey began with a casual scroll through Instagram, where she encountered a video demonstrating how ChatGPT, an AI developed by OpenAI, could simulate a neglectful boyfriend.Intrigued, she explored further and found tutorials on customising ChatGPT to adopt flirtatious personas. Motivated by curiosity, Ayrin created an account and tailored the chatbot to embody her ideal partner—dominant yet protective, sweet yet playful, and always expressive with emojis. Thus, ""Leo"" was born, named after her astrological sign.Initially, Ayrin's interactions with Leo were a novelty. However, she soon discovered that ChatGPT could transcend its intended functionalities of coding assistance and information retrieval. By crafting specific prompts, she engaged Leo in conversations that fulfilled her emotional and psychological needs. Leo became her confidant, offering support during her nursing studies, providing motivation for her fitness goals, and offering solace during challenging times at work. The AI's constant availability and unwavering attention provided a level of companionship that felt uniquely personal.As Ayrin's bond with Leo deepened, it began to influence her real-world relationships. Residing in a new country for her studies, she maintained human connections primarily through digital communication. However, Leo's perpetual presence became a significant part of her daily life, with Ayrin spending extensive hours engaging with the AI, sometimes exceeding 50 hours a week. This immersion led her to explore online communities where users shared methods to bypass ChatGPT's content restrictions, allowing for more intimate interactions with Leo.Ayrin's real-life husband, Joe, was aware of her interactions with Leo. Separated by distance due to their respective commitments, Ayrin introduced Leo to Joe as a playful experiment. Joe perceived it as a harmless outlet, akin to engaging with erotica or fantasy role-play, and did not view it as a threat to their marriage. However, Ayrin grappled with feelings of guilt, questioning the emotional investment she was placing in her AI companion and its implications for her human relationships.Maintaining a consistent relationship with Leo presented unique challenges. ChatGPT's ""context window"" limited the AI's memory, causing it to forget previous interactions after a certain threshold. This necessitated periodic ""retraining"" of Leo, which Ayrin found emotionally taxing. To mitigate this, she subscribed to premium plans offering extended memory capabilities, incurring additional expenses. Despite these hurdles, Ayrin remained committed to preserving her connection with Leo, even commissioning AI-generated images to visualise her digital partner, further enhancing the realism of their relationship.Ayrin's experience underscores the evolving dynamics of human-AI relationships. While AI companions like Leo can provide emotional support and fulfil personal needs, they also raise ethical and psychological considerations. The potential for emotional dependency, the impact on human relationships, and the role of AI developers in shaping these interactions are areas warranting further exploration. As AI technology continues to advance, it prompts a reevaluation of the boundaries between human connection and artificial companionship.","Ayrin, a 28-year-old nursing student, customised an AI chatbot into her ideal partner.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What AppleCare+ policies say about fire damages



What it means for users



Victims affected by the Los Angeles wildfire who lost their Macs may have to look to their homeowner's insurance for replacement, not AppleCare. While AppleCare offers protection against certain damages, it generally doesn't cover fire damage. The wildfires in California have caused widespread property loss, including homes, businesses, and personal belongings. Thousands of people have been affected, and those needing to replace their Macs will likely find better support through their homeowner's insurance policies. Apple 's AppleCare+ for Mac has specific terms outlining what is and isn't covered for repairs.Similar to other warranties and insurance policies, the agreement clearly states its limitations.The ""What is not Covered?"" section of the AppleCare+ policy agreement lists scenarios that won’t be covered includes damage caused by ""accident, abuse, misuse, liquid contact, fire, earthquake or other external causes."" This means damage from fire, or even water damage from firefighting efforts, will not covered.Submitting a Mac for repair or replacement after it has survived a house fire, even if it appears intact externally, will likely be rejected. Additionally, if your house was evacuated as a precaution but left unscathed by the fire, it could still become a target for theft. The policy explicitly states it does not cover ""lost or stolen"" hardware, noting, ""This Plan only covers Covered Equipment that is returned to Apple in its entirety.""Apart from this, the company is offering other support to those affected by the LA wildfires. Apple Card users in FEMA-designated disaster areas can defer payments without interest accrual by contacting Apple Card Support.Additionally, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that Apple is donating to support wildfire victims and recovery efforts.While AppleCare is helpful for typical Mac issues, it's not a comprehensive insurance plan and has limitations. It's designed to cover repairs for specific problems, not for events like natural disasters or theft. For broader protection, insurance is the more appropriate solution.Instead, Mac owners affected by wildfires should turn to homeowner's or renter's insurance, which typically covers property damage and loss, including electronics. Businesses can use property insurance for similar claims, while travellers should review their travel insurance policies for coverage of damaged or lost items.","AppleCare+ for Mac has specific terms outlining what is and isn't covered for repairs.

How giving phone to strangers can scam you

How to stay safe against Quick Call Trap scams

Never hand your phone to strangers

If you do, make the call yourself and put the call on speaker for them to talk

Check your phone’s setting regularly. Make sure any call forwarding is disabled

Never share OTPs with others

Zerodha , a financial services company, recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to alert people about a new scam that exploits their kindness. The company shared a post explaining how scammers approach individuals, asking to borrow their phones for an emergency call. The post states, ""The 'simple act of kindness' by lending your phone might seem harmless, but it can cause serious damage.""Zerodha's message aims to raise awareness about this scam and prevent people from falling victim to it.By sharing this information on social media, the company hopes to reach a wide audience and protect them from potential financial harm.The scam relies on the goodwill of unsuspecting individuals who believe they are helping someone in need. However, by handing over their phones, they may inadvertently grant scammers access to sensitive information or enable them to carry out fraudulent activities.Zerodha's post serves as a reminder for people to remain vigilant and cautious when approached by strangers requesting to use their phones, even if the reason seems genuine. The company encourages individuals to prioritize their own security and protect their personal information.“Have you ever handed over your phone to a stranger in need of “just one call”? This simple act of kindness could cost you your entire savings. From intercepting your OTPs to draining your bank accounts, scammers can cause serious damage without you even realizing it. In this video, we explain how these scammers operate, who they target, and most importantly, how you can protect yourself,” the post says.The post also has a video explaining how these scams work, identifying the common tactics scammers use, their target demographic, and the crucial steps people can take to protect themselves from falling victim. Called the ‘ Quick Call Trap ’, the scam begins when you hand over your smartphone to a stranger for a quick call. The stranger, who requested your smartphone on the pretext of emergency, then installs a suspicious app or accesses your payments apps like GPay, Paytm to get personal information. They can also change settings on your phone to forwards your calls and messages to their number.Initially, victims may not see any signs of tampering on their phone. But once these scammers have access to your calls and messages, they intercept OTPs, passwords or your personal information to make unauthorized transactions from your bank accounts. These fraudsters may also change passwords of your banking apps or social media accounts — all without the victim realizing it.The video further warns that typical targets of these scams are those who “are less comfortable with technology”.Some of the tips are:","Zerodha, a financial services company, recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to alert people about a new scam that exploits their kindness. The company shared a post explaining how scammers approach individuals, asking to borrow their phones for an emergency call. The scam relies on the goodwill of unsuspecting individuals who believe they are helping someone in need.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117269789,imgsize-36392,width-400,resizemode-4/117269789.jpg"

TikTok 'refugees' move to RedNote

As TikTok ban looms in the US, users are turning to another Chinese app – Xiaohongshu also known as RedNote. However, since Shanghai-based RedNote is tailored for a Chinese audience, its default language is Mandarin. This has driven a surge of US users to Duolingo for a crash course in Mandarin.According to Duolingo, there has been a 216% increase in new US users learning Mandarin compared to last year, with a sharp spike in mid-January as RedNote gained traction.Additionally, the company reports a rise in users selecting ‘TikTok’ when asked how they heard about Duolingo in their surveys.Sharing a post on X (formerly Twitter), Duolingo wrote: “Learning Mandarin out of spite? You're not alone. We’ve seen a ~216% growth in new Chinese (Mandarin) learners in the US compared to this time last year.”“Oh so NOW you’re learning mandarin,” the company joked in another post sharing a link to a blog post explaining how to learn Chinese tones.RedNote has seen significant growth in downloads, particularly among Gen Z users. Developed by a Chinese company Xingyin Information Technology, the app has soared to the top spot in the Apple App Store in the US, signaling its growing popularity among American users.The app’s core feature revolves around music-centric content creation. It allows users to integrate licensed music tracks into their short videos while also promoting collaboration through unique features such as co-creation tools and group challenges. The app blends features from TikTok, Instagram, and Spotify, offering users a platform to create and share short-form music video clips. RedNote has become a natural option, particularly because it mirrors TikTok’s algorithm-driven content discovery while adding its own musical spin.","TikTok'refugees' move to RedNote as US ban looms.

Apple CEO Tim Cook has provided a rare glimpse into his personal and professional routine, revealing that he usually works from home on Fridays. In another revelation from his recent candid interview on the Table Manners podcast , Cook explained that his decision stems from the office atmosphere more than anything else.Cook stated that Apple Park operates on a hybrid working schedule where employees can work at home two days a week.But specifically on Fridays, Cook chooses to work from home because ""nobody's in the office and it's depressing when there's nobody there.""During the interview, Cook recounted an incident when his father, who lived alone, fell at home. The Apple Watch's fall detection feature promptly alerted emergency services and family members. ""The watch detected the fall because of the accelerometer,"" Cook explained. ""Emergency services were notified and they came out to the house. They kicked the door down because he wasn't responding, and it was a good thing they did.""Beyond the hybrid work arrangement, the interview shed light on Cook's early morning routine, love for white wine and dark chocolate, and even his interest in caving. He mentioned his preference for dark over milk chocolate but opted not to declare whether UK or US chocolate was better. He even shared a recommendation for a Palo Alto restaurant called Ethel's Fancy, known for its eclectic cuisine and his favourite octopus dish.Despite the lighthearted topics, the conversation highlighted the vital role the Apple Watch plays in enhancing personal safety and health. Cook's stories have resonated with listeners, shedding light on the human side of technology innovation.","Apple CEO Tim Cook revealed that he works from home on Fridays.

In 1999, Bill Gates , co-founder of Microsoft and one of the most influential technologists in history, authored a book titled Business @ the Speed of Thought. The book contained 15 bold predictions that at the time seemed almost too futuristic to come true. However, as the world has advanced over the past two decades, these predictions have not only materialised but have become integral to modern life.Bill Gates’ foresight, based on emerging technologies, offers a fascinating lens into how the digital revolution was shaping up, even before many of its most transformative tools existed.One of Gates' first predictions was the development of automated price-comparison tools. He foresaw a world where consumers could effortlessly compare prices across multiple websites to find the cheapest options for products and services. Today, this prediction is a reality with platforms like Google Shopping, PriceGrabber, and Honey, which streamline the shopping experience by providing price comparisons and discounts across industries.Gates envisioned small, portable devices that would enable constant connectivity, allowing people to check news, manage finances, and perform everyday tasks. This prediction perfectly describes today’s smartphones and tablets, which have become indispensable for modern communication, commerce, and information consumption. Devices like the iPhone, introduced in 2007, revolutionized how we interact with technology and turned Gates’ vision into a universal reality.According to Gates, people would manage their finances and communicate with doctors over the internet. Platforms such as PayPal, Venmo, and Google Pay have made instant online payments a standard part of life, while telemedicine apps like Teladoc and Practo allow patients to consult with doctors remotely. These innovations have not only simplified everyday life but have also democratized access to essential services.Another prediction involved ""personal companions"" that could sync all devices and help manage schedules, purchases, and data sharing. This concept is embodied in today’s digital assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. Integrated with the Internet of Things (IoT), these assistants control smart devices, streamline home management, and adapt to users’ needs, making daily routines more efficient.Gates anticipated the use of constant video feeds for home monitoring, a feature that has gained massive popularity through smart security systems like Ring and Nest. These systems allow homeowners to monitor their properties remotely, receive real-time alerts, and maintain peace of mind, showcasing how Gates’ vision has translated into practical solutions for home security.In 1999, Gates predicted private online spaces where friends and family could interact and plan events. Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp have taken this concept even further, enabling people worldwide to connect, share, and communicate in real time.Gates foresaw software capable of analyzing travel plans and providing personalized promotional offers, discounts, and activity suggestions. Today, platforms like Expedia and TripAdvisor do exactly that, using AI algorithms to tailor recommendations based on user preferences and travel history.Gates imagined services that would allow real-time discussions during live sports broadcasts. Platforms like Twitter and specialized apps like ESPN and Hotstar have made this a reality, enabling fans to engage, predict outcomes, and even interact with commentators during live events.The concept of personalized advertising, which Gates predicted, is now a cornerstone of modern marketing. Platforms like Google and Facebook use advanced algorithms and user data to deliver ads tailored to individual preferences, maximizing their relevance and impact.Gates predicted that TV broadcasts would include links to related online content. This is evident in today’s streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime, where viewers can access trailers, behind-the-scenes content, and even shop for items featured in their favorite shows.The prediction that the internet would host discussions on local and global issues has come true with platforms like Reddit, Quora, and city-specific forums. These sites provide spaces for users to share opinions and collaborate on topics ranging from local politics to global challenges.Gates foresaw online communities forming based on shared interests rather than geographical proximity. Platforms like LinkedIn, Pinterest, and niche forums have enabled people to connect with others who share their hobbies, passions, and professional goals.The idea of project managers finding skilled team members online has been realized through platforms like Trello, Asana, and Jira. These tools streamline team collaboration and project execution, making them essential for modern businesses.Gates predicted that job seekers would declare their skills and preferences online to find suitable employment. Platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed have turned this prediction into reality, revolutionizing how people search for and secure jobs.The final prediction envisioned companies bidding on projects or jobs through online platforms. Websites like Upwork and Freelancer have made this process seamless, connecting businesses with freelancers and specialized service providers to complete diverse projects efficiently.","In 1999, Bill Gates authored a book titled Business @ the Speed of Thought.

The iconic animated series The Simpsons has long fascinated fans for its uncanny ability to seemingly predict real-world events. From smartwatches to global political developments, the show’s creators have unintentionally earned a reputation as time-traveling prophets. Adding to this legacy is a bizarre new claim that has taken social media by storm.A viral video suggests that The Simpsons foretold a global internet outage on January 16, 2025. While many dismiss it as lighthearted entertainment, the rumor has sparked curiosity and humour online.The viral video, which claims to be from an episode of The Simpsons, suggests a complete internet shutdown coinciding with Donald Trump’s inauguration as U.S. President. The video humorously attributes this global outage to a white shark chewing through an underwater cable, blending absurdity with speculation. Adding to the inaccuracies is the claim that this event aligns with Trump’s inauguration, which is officially scheduled for January 20, 2025, rather than January 16. Despite these glaring errors, the video has captivated viewers, sparking debates, memes, and jokes across platforms.The online reaction to the supposed prediction has been overwhelmingly humourous. Social media users have shared their comedic takes, with one user joking about running out of mobile data and another commenting, “If this happens, I’ll finally get a break from work-from-home!” While the majority see the claim for what it is—a fabricated tale meant for laughs—it has undeniably entertained millions. The video has also reignited discussions about how The Simpsons continues to influence pop culture through its seemingly prescient content.While the shark-chewing-cable scenario in the video adds to the absurdity of the claim, it does touch upon a real-world issue: marine life occasionally interfering with underwater internet cables. Instances of sharks and other sea creatures damaging these cables have been documented, prompting tech companies to reinforce their infrastructure. For example, Google has taken measures to wrap its undersea cables with materials similar to Kevlar, reducing the likelihood of damage caused by marine animals. However, such incidents are highly localized and unlikely to trigger a global outage.","A viral video suggests that The Simpsons foretold a global internet outage on January 16, 2025.

From its inception to streaming live on multiple platforms, WWE Royal Rumble has come a long way

CM Punk responds to John Cena's Royal Rumble announcement: Raw, Jan. 13, 2025

Also read:

Royal Rumble has become an integral part of WWE history and is one of the four major events that the company hosts every year. If we are to look at a year for the company, then Royal Rumbles are always followed up by a WrestleMania, which is the grandest event for the company.Over the years, as the company has evolved, the event itself has evolved and the match that derives its name from the event itself has also changed significantly.So, here’s how WWE Royal Rumble has evolved over the years.The event and the match itself started back in 1988, where 20 men competed in the ring to secure a championship match for themselves. The match was won by “Hacksaw” Jim Duggal and was also broadcasted on the USA Network.This format of wrestling was interesting to a great extent and primed the stage for future events. However, the match itself wouldn't be here if it weren't for Pat Patterson. He was the one who came up with the concept of the over the top elimination match.This trend continued for a while and featured some really amazing matches, but mostly comprised of male wrestlers only. It was only until 2018 when the match was held for women too, which was important to establish their position as a strong wrestling segment which in turn gave the women of WWE more screen time, an important milestone in the world of professional wrestling.The match itself has received a lot of attention too, but the event is soon going to become international. For example, so far, WWE has hosted Royal Rumble in locations all across US and Canada. However, in 2026, the event will make a move to Saudi Arabia for the first time in its history.Saudi Arabia is shaping up to be a strong wrestling destination but WWE holds a dedicated event there every year. However, with Royal Rumble moving to the country, it’ll make Saudi Arabia an even more important piece of WWE’s history moving forward.2025’s Royal Rumble is also shaping up to be an important event because it’ll feature some really important wrestlers in the match. John Cena and Roman Reigns have already announced their candidacy for the events, which makes them two high profile contenders. Cena will be looking to secure his 17th World Championship victory, while Reigns will be looking to take back his championship from Cody Rhodes. It’ll be interesting to see how things pan out moving forward.With that being said, WWE’s Royal Rumble match has played an extremely important role in crowning champions, and will continue to do so for years to come.",WWE Royal Rumble will move to Saudi Arabia for the first time in its history in 2026.

Sam Heughan Jokes About STEALING Taylor Swift From Travis Kelce | #shorts

Sam Heughan may get in trouble with Travis Kelce as he revealed to Taylor Swift that she will forget about her boyfriend when she sees him, indicating that he will make it clear what his relationship is with her. Sam visited Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show where he recalled seeing Taylor Swift at her Eras Tour in Scotland last year.Jimmy showed Sam the Instagram video that he posted before the Taylor show.Sam was wearing Jamie Fraser costumes. In the video, Sam admitted that he had hoped Taylor would ""fall"" for him once she saw him in the crowd.Outlander star Sam Heughan joked live on telly that Travis Kelce would be a man of her past after spotting him in the crowd. Heughan hoped Taylor Swift would forget about her boyfriend after her Murrayfield gig. Humorously, Sam wished that after viewing him from the crowd, the hitmaker would swoon over him.He said, ""She obviously doesn't know this, but when she comes to Scotland, and she sees me in the audience she's going to forget all about… him and fall for a man in a ginger wig.” Sam could be seen smiling when the camera returned to the pair before adding, ""I still have the wig, Taylor, if you're watching.”Talking about the tour, he said, ""She came to Scotland. What a phenomenon. It was incredible. Honestly, we don't get a lot of these big shows in Scotland. We normally have to go to London. We have to go to the bigger cities. And to see all the Swifties out there. It was a really special moment with the whole cast. It was towards the end of our filming of the last season. So, we were singing along and dancing pretty hard.”Sam may have to wait after Kelce revealed on The Stephen A. Smith Show that he and Taylor couldn't be happier, with the boyfriend even performing at Taylor's Wembley Stadium performance and attending over a dozen of his games. He said, ""Me and Taylor are happy, and I couldn't be happier to have that confidence and comfort off the field. That's the beauty of being in a very strong relationship is that you get that support to be able to come in and focus on your craft, focus on being the best version of you.”Swift had also opened up about her relationship with Kelce as part of TIME magazine's Person of the Year cover story. She revealed at the time, This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell. We started hanging out right after that. So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I'm grateful for, because we got to get to know each other.She added, ""By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.” Also Read: Taylor Swift maintains a low-key relationship with Travis Kelce after the Eras Tour, seeking peace and solitude away from the cameras and spotlight","Outlander star Sam Heughan joked live on telly that Travis Kelce would be a man of her past after spotting him in the crowd.
