Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage for a candid and humours conversation. The tech titans shared their thoughts on the future on generative AI and the long road to building tech empires. In a lighthearted moment, Huang joked that if he had known how long it would take to succeed, the he might have followed Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s oath and dropped out of college early. “If I had known it was going to take so long to succeed… I would've dropped out of college just like you,” Huang quipped, drawing laughter from the audience and Zuckerberg himself.The discussion involving Huang and Zuckerberg spanned around decades of innovation. The discussion started with Zuckerberg praising Huang’s role in powering the AI revolution. “It’s all you—you kind of made this happen,” Zuckerberg said, referring to Nvidia’s dominance in AI infrastructure.Responding to Zuckerberg, Jensen Huang said, “Why thank you… CEOs, we're delicate flowers,” poking fun at the need for appreciation even at the top.Along with this, the two tech leaders also joked about aging and appearances.“We’re pretty grizzled at this point,” Zuckerberg said. “I think we’re the two longest-standing founders in the industry.” Huang agreed, noting his gray hair while Zuckerberg commented on his curls.Huang founded Nvidia in 1993 with just the investment of $200. He launched the company on his 30th birthday which was later joined by co-founders Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. Nvidia started with a mission to advance 3D graphics. The breakthrough came in 1999 with the invention of the GPU, a technology that transformed computing.Fast forward to October 2025, Nvidia has entered the $5 trillion club. The chip maker managed to reach the market valuation of $5 trillion in just three months after crossing $ 4 trillion. This growth in Nvidia's market value suggest the escalating momentum in AI adoption across industries. Shares of Nvidia rose more than 4%, pushing its market capitalisation. Nvidia ranks ahead of Microsoft ($4 trillion) and Apple ($3.9 trillion), as well as Google parent Alphabet ($3.2 trillion), Amazon ($2.4 trillion) and Meta ($1.8 trillion).Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s journey started from his dorm room in Harvard in 2004, from where he started Facebook . He famously dropped out in 2005 to focus on the company, turning down his father’s offer to invest in a McDonald’s franchise.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says ‘Slack creates a lot of fake work’; Elon Musk responds: ‘As I was saying …’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sam-altman-says-slack-creates-a-lot-of-fake-work-elon-musk-responds-as-i-was-saying-/articleshow/125213230.cms,"



Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reacted sharply to Sam Altman ’s remarks about office productivity tools like Slack, saying that the ChatGPT-maker OpenAI will “compete directly with Microsoft”. Sam Altman, founder and CEO of OpenAI recently said that while there are many positives about Slack, it also creates a “lot of fake work”. In a now viral clip, Altman about how current workplace tools — such as Slack, Google Docs, email, and PowerPoint — may soon be replaced by a new generation of AI-driven systems.“There are positives about Slack,” Altman said, “but I kind of dread the first hour of the morning or last time before I go to bed, where I’m just dealing with this explosion of Slack. It creates a lot of fake work.”Altman added that he believes a new kind of AI-powered productivity platform is within reach — one where “your AI agent and my AI agent” will handle most communication and tasks, escalating only when necessary.Elon Musk, who has long been critical of OpenAI’s close partnership with Microsoft, responded on X (formerly known as Twitter) with a pointed remark: “As I was saying, OpenAI will compete directly with Microsoft.”In another post on X, Musk wrote: ""At this point, it’s insanely suicidal for Microsoft to continue supporting OpenAI""The exchange comes as AI companies race to redefine workplace productivity. While Microsoft has heavily invested in “Copilot” features across its apps, Altman’s comments suggest OpenAI could be developing its own tools that may compete in the same space.In a recent post shared on X, Altman suggested that the company is planning another major new business venture, putting it in direct competition with cloud technology giants, including Google, Amazon and Microsoft.Sam Altman wrote in the post: “We are also looking at ways to more directly sell compute capacity to other companies (and people); we are pretty sure the world is going to need a lot of 'AI cloud', and we are excited to offer this.”This means OpenAI could soon start selling cloud services, putting it in competition with established providers such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud. In September, OpenAI Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Sarah Friar made a similar point, suggesting that cloud providers had been “learning on our dime.” Her comment indicated that OpenAI was looking to safeguard its AI expertise from technology companies that may use its developments to advance their own capabilities.Notably, after the GPT-5 launch earlier in the year, Musk warned Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella about competition posed by OpenAI. “OpenAI is going to eat Microsoft alive,” he said.","Sam Altman, founder and CEO of OpenAI recently said that while there are many positives about Slack, it also creates a “lot of fake work” Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reacted sharply to Altman’s remarks about office productivity tools like Slack.

Apple responds to poor sales and customer feedback

Uncertain timeline as Apple refines ultra-thin strategy





Apple is reconsidering the future of its ultra-thin iPhone Air lineup, with plans to potentially release a redesigned second-generation model in spring 2027 featuring a dual-lens camera system, according to The Information. The move comes after the company indefinitely delayed the iPhone Air 2, which was originally scheduled to launch alongside the iPhone 18 Pro lineup in fall 2026.The redesign aims to address the primary complaint about the current iPhone Air: its single-lens rear camera. The Information reports that some Apple engineers are pushing to equip the next-generation model with a 48-megapixel Fusion Ultra Wide camera alongside the existing 48-megapixel Fusion Main camera, matching the dual-lens setup found on the standard iPhone 17.The first-generation iPhone Air, which launched in September 2025 at $999, has struggled to gain traction with consumers. The device's ultra-thin 5.6mm profile came at the cost of features buyers expect from premium smartphones, including a second camera, stereo speakers, and physical SIM support. With only a $100 price difference from the $1,099 iPhone 17 Pro—which offers a triple-lens camera system and significantly better battery life—many customers opted for the Pro model instead.Digital Chat Station, a Chinese tipster, first suggested the dual-camera possibility last week. The Information's report corroborates these claims, though implementing the change presents significant engineering challenges. Multiple technologies are currently housed in the iPhone Air's distinctive horizontal camera plateau to maximize battery space, meaning Apple would need to substantially redesign the device's internals to accommodate a second lens.If Apple proceeds with the spring 2027 launch, the iPhone Air 2 would release alongside the standard iPhone 18 and budget iPhone 18e, following Apple's reported new split launch cycle. The iPhone 18 Pro models and Apple's first foldable iPhone are expected to debut in fall 2026. However, given the extensive redesign required and the first-generation model's poor market performance, Apple's plans remain fluid and could change as development continues.",Apple is reportedly planning a second-generation iPhone Air with a dual-lens camera system.

Google's Private AI Compute promises advanced AI on your personal devices while your data stays yours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/googles-private-ai-compute-promises-advanced-ai-on-your-personal-devices-while-your-data-stays-yours/articleshow/125264697.cms,"Google To Invest $15 Billion On AI Hub In Visakhapatnam, CEO Sundar Pichai Speaks To PM Modi

How Google’s Private Compute keeps your information private

First features arriving on Pixel phones





Google wants your phone to think bigger while also keeping your data safe, and to achieve that, Google has built a cloud system that connects devices to heavy-duty Gemini models while keeping personal data sealed off—even from Google itself. It's called Private AI Compute, and much like how its name is similar to Apple's Private Cloud Compute, it also works similarlyIt's a solution to a problem that's been brewing: AI keeps getting smarter and hungrier for processing power, but people want their personal information to stay personal. Your phone can only do so much on its own, and Google says many AI tasks now need ""advanced reasoning and computational power"" beyond what fits in your pocket.Private AI Compute works through what Google calls a ""secure, fortified space"" running on its own chips—custom Tensor Processing Units paired with Titanium Intelligence Enclaves. Your device connects to this protected cloud environment through encrypted channels, creating a sealed pathway where your data flows but stays invisible to everyone else, including Google.The company brought in NCC Group to verify its privacy claims independently.The system encrypts everything in transit and uses AMD-based Trusted Execution Environments to wall off memory from the broader network, blocking outside access at the hardware level.Pixel devices are getting the first taste of this technology. Magic Cue on the Pixel 10 now delivers sharper, more contextual suggestions by pulling from those beefier cloud models. Meanwhile, the Recorder app on Pixel 8 and newer phones can now summarise transcriptions in seven languages: English, Mandarin Chinese, Hindi, Italian, French, German, and Japanese.Google says this is only the start. More products will get Private AI Compute capabilities down the line, and users who want to peek under the hood can track when it's running through developer settings.","Google has built a cloud system that connects devices to heavy-duty Gemini models while keeping personal data sealed off.

The system uses Google’s advanced image model, Nano Banana, to apply realistic changes while preserving the natural look of the photo.Google is also introducing a new section called “Create with AI”, which includes ready-made templates for popular edits. These templates allow users to transform their photos into stylized versions — such as Renaissance portraits or comic book scenes — with just a few taps. The editor now recognizes individuals from Google Photos’ face groups, making it easier to apply personalized edits across multiple subjects in a single image.In addition to editing tools, Google is expanding its AI-powered search to over 100 countries, allowing users to ask complex questions about their photo library. For example, users can search for “photos of me at the beach with blue skies” or “pictures of my dog playing fetch,” and the AI will surface relevant results using contextual understanding.

Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





MUNICH: OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT violated German copyright laws by reproducing lyrics from songs by best-selling musician Herbert Groenemeyer and others, a court ruled on Tuesday, in a closely watched case against the firm over its use of lyrics to train its language models. The regional court found that the company trained its AI on protected content from nine German songs, including Groenemeyer’s hits “Maenner” and “Bochum”. The case was brought by German music rights society GEMA.Presiding judge Elke Schwager ordered OpenAI to pay damages for the use of copyrighted material, without disclosing a figure.OpenAI had argued that its language models did not store or copy specific training data but, rather, reflected what they had learned based on the entire training data set.Since the output would only be generated as a result of user inputs known as prompts, it was not the defendants, but the users who would be liable, OpenAI had argued. However, the court found that both the memorisation in the language models and the reproduction of the song lyrics in the chatbot’s outputs constitute infringements of copyright exploitation right.“We disagree with the ruling and are considering next steps,” a spokesperson for OpenAI said. “The decision is for a limited set of lyrics and does not impact the millions of people who use our technology every day.”REUTERS",German court rules OpenAI violated copyright laws by reproducing lyrics from songs by best-selling musician Herbert Groenemeyer and others.

Putin's Men Crush Resistance In Kupyansk! Oil Depot & Rail Hubs Fall, 5,000 Ukrainian Forces Trapped

DW Fact check: False

Who is Kussia88?





""I've been mobilized, I'm heading to Chasiv Yar,"" says what appears to be a young Ukrainian soldier through floods of tears in the back of a military vehicle. ""Help me, I don't want to die. I'm only 23. Please help me.""A reverse image search using screenshots reveals that the video has been posted hundreds of times on social media, racking up millions of views and pushing the message that Ukraine is drafting young men against their will to replace losses on the battlefield amid the continuing Russian invasion.DW found the video shared across various social media platforms in a dozen different languages, including English, German, French, Italian, Spanishand Russian. The most viral instance of the video appeared on a Hungarian X account, where it had been viewed at least 1.8 million times.Claim: ""Ukrainian men as young as 23 are being conscripted and sent to the front""However, not only is the video factually incorrect (the minimum conscription age in Ukraine was lowered from 27 to 25 in April 2024, but never to 23), but it is also fake, to be precise: it was generated by artificial intelligence.This is clear from visual inaccuracies in the video, such as the poorly-fitting helmet, which doesn't match standard Ukrainian military equipment.Not only that, a basic facial recognition searchreveals that the face is actually that of Vladimir Yuryevich Ivanov, a young Russian streamer from St. Petersburg who uses the online pseudonym Kussia88.On its own, ""kussia"" (pronounced ""kasha"") means ""porridge"" in Russian (каша). But the use of ""88"" (neo-Nazi code for ""Heil Hitler"") and the Latin transcription using a double ""SS"" are no coincidence.Nor is the use of the letters ""IA"". In international neo-Nazi circles, ""IA"" would be understood to mean ""14"" — a code referring to the ""14 words""propagated by American neo-Nazi David Lane: ""We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.""The slogans have served as a rallying cry for militant white nationalists internationally.Indeed, the numbers 1488 and 8814 appear in the URL and profile description of Ivanov's accounts on TikTok and Boosty(a Russian platform that enables content creators to earn regular income through subscriptions and donations from their community).According to several Reddit chats, Ivanov's Twitch account, which has over 1.3 million followers, has been subject to at least one temporary ban in recent months.The AI video using Ivanov's face seems to have first appeared on the now-deleted TikTok channel @fantomoko, along with dozens of other similar AI clips, all supposedly depicting Ukrainian soldiers crying in military vehicles.Most only seem to have been viewed a few thousand times, but two had over 800,000 views, one had over 1.5 million views and the most popular had over 2.1 million. Some of the videos even featured the watermark ""Sora,"" OpenAI's image generator.Another face that appears regularly on clips posted by the @fantomoko account was that of Aleksei Gubanov, a critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Gubanov, who now lives in New York, told DW that he has ""absolutely no connection"" to the clips. ""All of them were created by someone using AI and without my consent or involvement.""He added he had warned his audience ""that someone is deliberately trying to stir public outrage by creating this kind of content. Those videos play directly into Russian propaganda narratives and gain millions of views. To be absolutely clear — I did not create, approve, or participate in any of those videos, and I strongly condemn the use of AI-generated fake media for manipulation or propaganda.""DW also reached out to Ivanov but had not received a response by the time of publication. According to the Ukrainian database ""Stars about war,"" which documents celebrities' positions on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Ivanov does not typically comment on the war and was once reprimanded by the Russian authorities for mocking the children of mobilized soldiers. After that, he reportedly apologized in a video shot against the background of a Russian flag, and stated that Crimea is Russian.Screenshot of Russian streamer Ivanov (aka Kussia88) posting a comment in Russian that translates as: ""The Twitter crowd have finally got on board the hype train.""Screenshot of Russian streamer Ivanov (aka Kussia88) posting a comment in Russian that translates as: ""The Twitter crowd have finally got on board the hype train.""'The Twitter crowd have finally got on board the hype train,' responds Kussia, sarcastically.Image: TelegramOn his Telegram channel, he responded to suggestions that he was involved with the AI videos and that he is a ""pro-Putin Nazi"" sarcastically, saying: ""The Twitter crowd have finally learned what 'delivery' means"" — Russian Twitch slang effectively meaning: ""They've finally got on board the hype train.""Either way, regardless of whether Ivanov was actively involved in their creation or not, and regardless of his views, the videos going viral remain entirely fake.","A video showing young Ukrainian soldiers crying has gone viral on social media. The video is factually incorrect and was generated by artificial intelligence. The face in the video is actually that of a Russian streamer known as Kussia88.

Why the UAE deliberately sank 3 ships: Is it good for the ocean’s ecosystem?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/why-the-uae-deliberately-sank-3-ships-is-it-good-for-the-oceans-ecosystem/articleshow/125237316.cms,"Inchcape 1, sunk off Al Aqah in 2001, has transformed into a thriving marine habitat, attracting divers with its diverse marine life/ Image: vipdivingdubai





The Concept: Artificial reefs for marine life





Inchcape 1: A Diver’s haven in Al Aqah





Inchcape 2: A thriving Reef off Khor Fakkan





Inchcape 10: A marine wonderland in Fujairah





The Impact: Ecological balance and marine conservation

Khaleej Times





Why the UAE deliberately sank 3 ships: Is it bad for the ocIn a unique blend of environmental stewardship and ecotourism, the UAE has deliberately sunk three ships off its east coast, not as an accident, but as a conscious effort to promote marine conservation. The vessels, Inchcape 1, Inchcape 2, and Inchcape 10, have been transformed into thriving artificial reefs that now attract divers from across the world. This innovative approach is a testament to the UAE’s commitment to protecting its natural resources while fostering sustainable tourism.The concept behind sinking these ships is simple yet effective: to create artificial reefs that mimic the role of natural coral reefs in the ocean. Over time, the ships have become vibrant ecosystems, teeming with marine life. These reefs not only support a wide range of fish species but also help to promote biodiversity, offering an underwater experience for divers.The UAE’s efforts are especially significant given the rising threats to ocean ecosystems, including pollution and coral bleaching. The ships, once decommissioned, serve as a reminder that responsible management can help restore marine habitats.Sunk in 2001, Inchcape 1 lies about 32 meters below the surface, off the coast of Al Aqah, Fujairah. Accessible by boat in just five minutes from Al Aqah, this site is recommended for experienced divers, thanks to its depth and complexity. The wreck has turned into a bustling underwater city, home to large schools of red snapper, cardinal fish, and a wide variety of other marine creatures.Divers exploring the site can witness firsthand how the wreck has evolved into a rich marine habitat. Snorkelling and diving equipment are essential to access the site, and the area is becoming a popular spot for eco-tourists looking to experience the UAE’s commitment to sustainable diving.Inchcape 2, intentionally sunk in 2002, rests at a depth of around 22 meters off the coast of Khor Fakkan. It has quickly become one of the most popular dive sites in the region. As the wreck has developed into a thriving coral reef, it now attracts a variety of marine life, including parrotfish, moray eels, small boxfish, and long-tailed rays. The presence of barracudas also adds to the site's allure, making it a must-visit destination for professional divers seeking to explore a healthy and diverse underwater ecosystem.To visit, divers typically embark on a 25-minute boat ride from Al Aqah. Diving equipment is mandatory, and access is managed through licensed diving centers. These centers not only ensure safety but also educate visitors on how artificial reefs contribute to ocean health.Perhaps the most remarkable of the three, Inchcape 10 (formerly known as 'Awaiz') was sunk in 2003. Resting at a depth of about 23 meters off Fujairah, it is one of the largest ships deliberately sunk to create an artificial reef. This site has become a focal point for divers due to its rich biodiversity, including moray eels, barracudas, and other species.Located just an 8-minute boat ride from the Fujairah International Marine Club, the wreck offers an exciting opportunity to explore the wonders of marine life. The site is open year-round, and divers must book through licensed diving centers to gain access. Similar to the other wrecks, the presence of thriving marine life at Inchcape 10 speaks volumes about the success of the UAE’s ecotourism initiatives.Saleh Al-Dhahouri, a diver from Dibba Al Fujairah, has seen firsthand the positive transformation that these shipwrecks have brought to the area. “The diving there is wonderful, a beautiful place, and you couldn't get over the amount of fish and coral,” he said, as told to. He explained that before the ships were sunk, diving opportunities were limited. “With these ships, diving sites have increased, and they have become part of the weekly diving program,” he added, highlighting how these artificial reefs have revitalized local dive tourism.Emirati diver Mintaha Al Shehhi, who specializes in sharks, has been diving in the region for over three years. She praised the ecological balance at sites like Inchcape 2, where frequent sightings of sharks and turtles indicate a healthy environment. “Sharks do not choose random locations, and turtles only pass through when they feel secure and find natural abundance,” she said, emphasizing that the presence of these larger creatures is a sign of a thriving and balanced marine ecosystem.ean’s ecosystem?","The UAE has deliberately sunk three ships off its east coast, not as an accident, but as a conscious effort to promote marine conservation.

Meet the creator - Chef Nouel Catis

The new Abu Dhabi Chocolate

The Main Flavor: A harmonious blend of rich salted caramel and traditional halwa (a dense, sweet delicacy).

Emirati Spices: The filling is layered with complex flavors like cardamom and fragrant saffron, giving it instant warmth and depth.

Local Touches: It features authentic ingredients like creamy tahini and sweet date syrup. The chef even notes hints of Balaleet, the sweet and savory Emirati breakfast dish.

Final Touch: To ensure its capital-city status, the bar is lavishly topped with shimmering 24-karat gold flakes.

Where to get the Golden Bar

Exclusive Initial Location: The Abu Dhabi Chocolate bar is initially sold exclusively at Rain Cafe outlets across the UAE.

Wider Delivery: For the brand's other popular flavors (like the Dubai Chocolate), you can often find them available for order on local food delivery platforms like Careem and Talabat in both Dubai and Abu Dhabi.

Price check

Price Range: The Abu Dhabi Chocolate bar is priced at approximately Dh100 (roughly $27 USD) for a 200g bar.

Other Sna'ap Bars: For comparison, the original 90g Dubai Chocolate bars typically sell for around Dh38.

Getting the viral treat outside the UAE

Rely on Travelers: The most common way to get the bars abroad is through friends, family, or colleagues who are traveling from the UAE and can carry them back as a unique souvenir.

Third-Party Shipping Services: Some international fans resort to using re-shipping or concierge services based in the UAE. These services purchase the bar locally and then ship it internationally, though this adds significant cost and is not handled by the chocolate maker itself.

Check Pop-ups: Keep an eye on the official Sna'ap/Chef Nouel Catis social media channels. As the brand grows, they may announce international pop-up events or partnerships that temporarily make the bars available in other countries.

Dubai’s famous Pistachio Crunch

Pistachio-Tahini Cream: A smooth, creamy paste with a deep, nutty Middle Eastern flavor.

Crispy Kataifi: Finely shredded, toasted filo dough, which gives the bar an irresistible, signature crunch (inspired by the famous dessert Knafeh).





If you’ve seen videos of people biting into a thick, crunchy chocolate bar and gasping with delight, you’ve met “Dubai chocolate.” Behind that viral crunch is Filipino pastry chef Nouel Catis, and now he’s turning the idea into new, capital-flavoured treats (think salted caramel + halwa). This is the story foodies want: invention, nostalgia, social-media fame, and a chef turning a trend into a brand you can actually taste.Chef Nouel Catis is a Filipino-born pastry specialist who quietly became the brains behind the original Dubai chocolate, an inventive bar that layers Middle Eastern flavours (pistachio, tahini/kunafa elements) inside a crisp, hollow chocolate shell. His approach mixes childhood memories, heritage ingredients and modern pastry technique to produce a product that looks simple but performs like a theatrical dessert on your palate. His name has since become linked with Sna’ap, his own chocolate brand and pop-up experiences.After conquering the global desert scene with Dubai’s crunchy bar, Chef Nouel Catis is paying homage to the UAE capital with the new Abu Dhabi Chocolate. This bar ditches the pistachio crunch for a flavor profile that is richer, spicier, and truly rooted in Emirati heritage.The Abu Dhabi bar is an ode to local sweets and spices, captured in a thick, luxurious form:Priced around Dh100 for a 200g bar, this is positioned as a truly luxurious, indulgent piece of edible art—initially sold exclusively at local hotspots like Rain Cafe.Because the Abu Dhabi Chocolate is a brand-new, special-edition launch, its availability is currently quite exclusive. The bar is a collaborative effort with a popular local cafe brand.The unique artisanal quality, the luxurious ingredients (like 24K gold), and its status as a viral, limited-edition treat put this bar in the premium category.For fans who want a genuine taste of luxury blended with authentic Emirati flavors, many consider the unique experience a worthwhile indulgence.If you’re a traveling foodie or a UAE resident currently abroad, getting these viral bars requires a bit of planning, as direct international shipping from the cafe is usually not available.If you're active on social media, you've definitely seen the satisfying snap of the viral Dubai Chocolate. Created by Chef Nouel Catis of the Sna'ap brand, this chocolate bar became a global hit because it’s much more than just a sweet treat, it’s a textural masterpiece.The secret to the original bar's obsession-worthy status lies in its core ingredients:This perfect contrast between the rich, creamy filling and the crispy pastry is why foodies worldwide have been trying to recreate this famous UAE-born chocolate.So, whether you're clicking ""add to cart"" via a delivery app in Dubai or hoping a traveling friend brings you a gold-flaked souvenir, one thing is clear: Chef Nouel Catis has successfully merged Middle Eastern heritage with modern indulgence.

UAE records lowest temperature of the season at 9.8°C in Al Ain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-records-lowest-temperature-of-the-season-at-9-8c-in-al-ain/articleshow/125197252.cms,"Raknah, Al Ain recorded 9.8°C Sunday morning, the UAE’s lowest seasonal temperature, NCM confirmed/Representative Image

Today’s cold snap





Historical context





Winter in the UAE





Implications and observations





Daily life: Cooler mornings may require warmer clothing, while daytime conditions remain comfortable.

Travel and tourism: Early-morning temperatures in places like Al Ain and Ras Al Khaimah could affect outdoor activities, especially in desert or mountainous regions.

Agriculture: Frost-sensitive crops in elevated areas might need extra protection during these cold snaps.





The UAE woke up to a chilly start Sunday as temperatures in Raknah, Al Ain, plunged to 9.8°C, the lowest of the season so far, signaling the arrival of winter across the Emirates, the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) reportedAt 6:30am UAE local time, the mercury dropped to 9.8°C in Raknah, Al Ain, marking the coldest reading in the country today. The NCM confirmed this figure, emphasizing that winter in the UAE brings milder conditions compared to the scorching summer months.Typical winter daytime temperatures range between 15°C and 25°C, offering a welcome relief for residents and visitors alike. However, early mornings and elevated areas often experience significantly cooler temperatures.While today’s low is notable, it is far from the UAE’s all-time record. On February 3, 2017, temperatures in the country plunged to -5.7°C at Jebel Jais, the nation’s highest peak located around 25 kilometres from Ras Al Khaimah City. This remains the coldest temperature ever officially recorded in the UAE.For the current year, 2025, the lowest recorded temperature prior to today was 1.9°C on January 4 at Jebel Jais, following a 2.2°C reading the day before. These figures illustrate the pattern of early-morning chills in mountainous areas, even as daytime temperatures remain moderate.The UAE’s winter season, which typically runs from November to March, is characterized by cooler mornings, mild days, and relatively low humidity levels. While daytime temperatures in most urban and coastal areas stay between 15°C and 25°C, residents in desert regions or high-altitude locations may experience sharp dips in temperature overnight, particularly during the colder months.The NCM continues to monitor these fluctuations closely, issuing guidance for residents to prepare for colder mornings and potential weather-related impacts, particularly in elevated or exposed areas.Today’s 9.8°C reading in Raknah is a reminder that while UAE winters are mild compared to many countries, early-morning chills can still be significant, especially in inland and mountainous locations","The UAE woke up to a chilly start Sunday as temperatures in Raknah, Al Ain, plunged to 9.8°C, the lowest of the season so far.

Service Accessibility: The Absher platform currently offers more than 100 digital services, which benefited over 24 million users in the year 2024 alone. Jawazat has also introduced the ""Smart Voice Agent"" service, available 24/7 by calling the number 992, providing immediate assistance to users without the need for direct employee intervention.





Acting Director General of Passports (Jawazat), Maj. Gen. Saleh Al-Murabba, announced at the Digital Government Forum 2025 in Riyadh that the directorate will shortly roll out a Self-Deportation Platform to let people who are in the Kingdom illegally complete departure procedures online. He also unveiled a Smart Track system that uses smart cameras and AI to verify identities and process groups of travellers, potentially eliminating the need for routine passport-control staff at some checkpoints.The Self-Deportation Platform is an online portal designed to replace manual, paper-heavy deportation practices. According to the announcement, once security and technical preparations are completed, individuals identified as violators of residency, labour or border rules will be able to access the platform, complete travel documentation and finalise their exit without in-person processing. The move is framed as both an efficiency and a modernisation step, shifting a time-consuming administrative task into a secure digital flow.Key practical points reported so far:Smart Track is the complementary system for major travel hubs. It uses advanced smart cameras and AI technology to check identities and can reportedly verify up to 35 people at once, allowing essential travel procedures to complete smoothly without an individual passport-control officer present.The system aims to efficiently accelerate passenger flow at airports and other checkpoints by intelligently automating identity verification and cross-checking against vital security databases. Officials say the innovative technology will be introduced once integration with Jawazat security systems is fully completedFor travelers passing through the Kingdom’s ports, two major technological leaps are set to eliminate slow-moving lines and long waiting times:Furthermore, departure procedures are being streamlined to a great extent. By linking technical and security systems to smart devices and digital cameras for automated verification, the traditional requirement of passing through passport control at departure lounges will be eliminated, creating a seamless boarding experience.The push for digitalization extends beyond the airport floor and into the wider administrative ecosystem, with the Absher platform at the center of innovation:Saudi Arabia's commitment to these digital reforms, anchored by the launch of the Self-Deportation Platform and the AI-driven Smart Track system, clearly signals a new and transformative era. By transforming its ports into smart, efficient gateways and streamlining administrative services through cutting-edge technology, the Kingdom is solidifying its position as a leader in digital government, ensuring faster travel, seamless security, and a radically improved experience for all who enter or exit its borders.","Self-Deportation Platform to let people who are in the Kingdom illegally complete departure procedures online.

Banality of evil: German nurse kills 10 patients,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/banality-of-evil-german-nurse-kills-10-patients-to-reduce-workload/articleshow/125132828.cms,"



It sounds like a line from a Kafka play rewritten by Kafka’s nurse. A man whose job was to ease suffering decided the easiest way to do that was to remove the sufferer entirely.According to a BBC report, a palliative care nurse in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering 10 patients and attempting to kill 27 others. His motive? Not money. Not mercy. Just the mundane — to lighten his workload during overnight shifts.Between December 2023 and May 2024, this nameless nurse — anonymous by law, infamous by act — played God with a syringe. Prosecutors said he injected elderly patients with morphine and midazolam, not to relieve their pain but to make his rounds quieter, his night easier, his burden lighter. He showed, the court heard, “irritation” at those who demanded too much care — as if suffering were an inconvenience on the shift roster.The court in Aachen called it a crime of “particular severity of guilt,” ensuring he will never walk free again. But what’s truly chilling is not just the scale of his actions — it’s their ordinariness. A man trained since 2007 to heal became, by 2024, an executioner in scrubs, armed not with malice but with indifference.Investigators are now exhuming more bodies, probing whether this was just the visible tip of a career-long pattern.If confirmed, he could rival the grim legacy of Niels Högel — the German nurse sentenced in 2019 for killing 85 patients in northern hospitals between 1999 and 2005. Högel wanted to play hero: inject, cause cardiac arrest, then resuscitate — a perverse performance of saviourhood.This new killer? He wanted peace and quiet.That’s the most terrifying part. Evil, it turns out, doesn’t always come snarling. Sometimes it sighs, glances at the clock, and reaches for the morphine. It isn’t ideological or even sadistic — just tired, overworked, and catastrophically devoid of empathy.In that sense, this case isn’t only about a man who murdered ten people. It’s about the slow erosion of compassion in systems that reduce care to shift patterns and metrics. When life becomes data, death becomes a shortcut.Germany has seen this before. It will see it again. Because as Hannah Arendt might have said of this nurse, it wasn’t the devil in him that killed those patients — it was the paperwork.","A palliative care nurse in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering 10 patients and attempting to kill 27 others.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.





When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets. The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets. To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125131123,imgsize-132093,width-400,resizemode-4/enigmatic-legal-inquiry.jpg"

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification







Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Implications for AI training and copyright



OpenAI accused of Game of Thrones copyright violation







ChatGPT creator has been accused of copyright infringement by a German court. As reported by Reuters, a regional court in Munich has ruled that OpenAI’s popular chatbot ChatGPT has violated German copyright laws by reproducing lyrics from nine popular songs without any authorisation. The lawsuit filed by German music ights organization GEMA, which represents composers, lyricists, and publishers accuse OpenAI of copyright infringement.As per the report, the German court found that OpenAI has trained its language model on copyright-protected content, including lyrics from songs by renowned German artists such as Herbert Grönemeyer and Helene Fischer. Notable tracks cited in the case include Grönemeyer’s “Männer” and “Bochum”, and Fischer’s “Atemlos durch die Nacht”.Judge Elke Schwager has ordered OpenAI to pay damages for the unauthorised use of German songs. However, the report has not disclosed the exact amount to be paid by OpenAI.The ruling made by the German court underscores the growing concerns over how generative AI models are trained on copyright data. GEMA’s legal advisor Kai Welp noted that the organization hopes this decision will lead to clearer frameworks for compensating rights holders when their work is used to train AI systems.OpenAI on the other hand argued that its models do not store or copy specific data, but rather generate outputs based on patterns learned from large datasets. But, the court concluded that memorisation and reproduction of lyrics by ChatGPT constituted a breach of copyright law.This is not the first time that OpenAI has faced such allegations. Last month, the ChatGPT creator faced copyright violations charges in the US. A US judge has reportedly allowed a major class-action lawsuit against OpenAI to move forward. Citing a ChatGPT-generated idea for a ""Game of Thrones"" book as a potential copyright violation, US District Judge Sidney Stein issued a ruling in Manhattan Federal Court that addressed the AI's resemblance to legally protected works, a report claims. Judge Stein said: “A reasonable jury could find that the allegedly infringing outputs are substantially similar to plaintiffs' works.""According to a Business Insider report, the decision was made in a consolidated case brought by numerous authors, including Game of Thrones creator George R.R. Martin, Michael Chabon, and Sarah Silverman, against both OpenAI and Microsoft. The authors allege that OpenAI and Microsoft violated their copyrights by using their books without permission to train large language models, resulting in AI ""outputs"" that resembled the original material.","A German court has ruled that OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT has violated German copyright laws by reproducing lyrics from nine popular songs.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix.

“

We can see very much people say, ‘Oh, I’m gonna go try that,’ and we can see the usage it’s driving,”

“Who would have thought that a girl who was getting thousands of views on hair rollers is now promoting AI through Microsoft Copilot,”

“The whole idea about Copilot is really about empowering you to be the best you,”

“If I were to, you know, croak, would I still have to pay off my credit card bills?”

“

Yes, debts don’t disappear.”

“With Copilot, there’s no such thing as a cringe question.”

“It’d be hard-pressed for them to surpass the consumer ChatGPT at this point,”





Microsoft is deploying anto increase consumer downloads of its Copilot chatbot. With this move, the software giant is specifically targeting younger users to better compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The company has recruited several popular influencers in America for the promotional push. In an interview with Fortune, Yusuf Mehdi, Consumer Chief Marketing Officer at Microsoft, said:Mehdi hopes to persuade key influencers to adopt Copilot as their preferred chatbot and then use their large followings to market the assistant. He also indicated that Microsoft is seeing better results from influencer campaigns than from traditional media, but declined to provide specific metrics or payment details for the promotions.The company has partnered with social media creator Alix Earle, who gained recognition for sharing details of her life through her popular Get Ready With Me (GRWM) videos. The 24-year-old from New Jersey has a combined following of 12.6 million on Instagram and TikTok, and her online popularity led to a spot on the current season of Dancing With the Stars. In June, Earle joined Mehdi on a panel about influencer marketing at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity.Earle collaborates with Microsoft on ideas for her videos but is free to improvise. During a shoot in May, she asked Copilot how to look younger after some followers said she looked like she was 40. The chatbot replied that she shouldThe video drew 15.4 million views on her TikTok account, which is nearly double her follower count and she captioned it,adding the hashtag #copilotpartner.Mehdi pointed to another video Earle made about the new Copilot Groups feature as proof that the campaign is resonating.he said. That post recieved 1.9 million views on Instagram and 7 million on TikTok.Twin sisters Brigette and Danielle Pheloung, both 28, also joined the campaign. Known for their fashion and beauty content, they have a combined 3.4 million followers across Instagram and TikTok.Brigette said. To engage women aged 18 to 34, the sisters asked Copilot to help them design ‘70s- and '80s-inspired outfits for New York Fashion Week. The bot suggested shoulder pads, prompting Danielle to stuff socks into her shirt to achieve the look.Microsoft’s Copilot brand is primarily associated with workplace tools that organise data, summarise meetings, and retrieve information, but this campaign takes a different direction.Mehdi added.Influencer Brandon Edelman, known online as Bran Flakezz with 1.7 million followers, also collaborated with Microsoft. His videos, filmed in Los Angeles, feature light conversations with Copilot about topics such as dating, travel, and overcoming imposter syndrome.In one video, Edelman asks,to which Copilot replies,Microsoft captioned the post,The Copilot influencer initiative has drawn well-known creators and generated significant viewership. Still, analysts like Jason Wong of Gartner remain cautious.he said.Microsoft’s Copilot currently has 150 million active users each month, which lags behind OpenAI’s claim of 800 million weekly active users for ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, which has 650 million monthly active users. While Microsoft has an advantage with corporate clients, it faces challenges in the consumer market, particularly among younger consumers.","Microsoft is deploying anto increase consumer downloads of its Copilot chatbot.
