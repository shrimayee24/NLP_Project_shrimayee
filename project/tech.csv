Assigning rider

Just before cooking, or sometimes in the middle of it, it’s common now to realise an ingredient is missing, and order it knowing it will arrive within 10 minutes. One user tells us that she ordered from her bedroom, and by the time she walked to the kitchen to start cooking, she was stunned to find the delivery guy knocking on the door. Given how busy our lives are, many think they can no longer do without this “instant” delivery.But how are the delivery platforms doing it? This level of speed at scale is possible only because of AI/ ML.“The AI systems are making millions of decisions per second, and doing it concurrently at multiple levels – for the user, the store and the delivery partner,” says Goda Ramkumar, VP of data science at Swiggy, which offers the Instamart 10-minute service .The moment you open the app, it locates you with location intelligence – it knows if you’re in a society apartment or an independent house. It then takes you through a personalised search experience, even as it sets expectations about the time of arrival (ETA). The search goes to the store/ restaurant, and rider that can deliver the fastest. Once you’ve ordered, and the products are packed and picked up, ML is used to find the fastest route. Till the time it reaches you, Ramkumar says, ML is proactively looking for delays or anomalies such as traffic jams or bike breakdowns to alert the consumer about delays.ETA prediction is based on deep learning. There are multiple legs involved such as preparation or packaging time, delivery partner’s travel time to the outlet, and travel time to the customer’s home. Ramkumar, an IIT Madras alum who previously worked at Sabre and Ola, says complex optimisations have to run, and run fast, as orders keep flowing, in order to give the customer the ETA.Data analytics is also key to forecasting demand in a particular locality, and ensuring right inventory in each dark store – where inventory is kept, packaged and delivered from. Rakshit Daga, CPTO and head of SaaS at BigBasket, which has the BBNow quick service, says AI-powered inventory forecasting models are particularly important for perishable goods, and helps in higher product availability and lower write-offs. “In the quick commerce model the inventory forecasting model is also slightly different from that for the regular slotted delivery model because the size of assortment you can support is different, as well as how you store this assortment,” he says.Data is used to decide the location of dark stores, to ensure rapid delivery. It is used to decide store layout – based on how frequently an item is ordered and which items are ordered together. This enables quick packaging. AI, Daga says, even helps decide the optimal placement and assortment of products based on factors like seasonality and upcoming festivals.Analytics is used further in manpower planning in dark stores – forecasting peak and nonpeak hours, designing shifts so that right personnel are there at the right time. It is used to make sure the right number of riders are available at a point in time.Deep learning is used to assign the right rider. The rider needs to reach both the store and delivery address fast. Also, if the delivery address is nearby, a rider on a bicycle or e-bike may be fine, but if it’s some distance away, it might need a rider with a regular bike. So, Ramkumar says, there are parallel AI operations happening at multiple ends.Daga says sophisticated algorithms factor in the existing traffic conditions, travel time, vehicle loading, and rider familiarity to determine the most efficient routes and rider allocations. “It’s such an exciting problem trying to figure out what the delivery time is and trying to deliver consistently an experience that is close to 10 minutes with all these variables, and at the same time keeping your riders safe by not putting undue pressure on them to drive fast,” he adds","Deep learning is used to assign the right rider.

Unlike traditional crypto assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, meme coins thrive on community engagement and viral trends. Notable examples include Dogecoin , which was inspired by the Shiba Inu dog meme, and Shiba Inu coin itself. While many of these coins begin as jokes or light-hearted projects, their value can soar rapidly based on social media hype and internet culture.A cryptocurrency user, known by the username Lockchain, took to X (formerly Twitter) to share an astonishing investment journey. On September 10, the user invested $1,300 (roughly Rs 1 lakh) in Moo Deng coins, a cryptocurrency inspired by the internet's favourite pygmy hippo. Within just two weeks, the value of this meme coin surged dramatically, turning the initial investment into over Rs 12 million (around Rs 100 crore).The Moo Deng meme coin is the latest addition to the growing list of meme-based cryptocurrencies. It is named after a two-month-old pygmy hippo from Thailand, who gained internet fame for her small size and adorable appearance. Moo Deng’s viral videos, shared on platforms like Instagram and TikTok , captured hearts worldwide.The baby hippo’s name, which means ""bouncy pork"" in Thai, was chosen through an online poll in August 2024, further boosting her internet fame. In just 24 hours after its creation, the Moo Deng coin surged in value by over 90%, making it one of the fastest-growing meme coins of the year. The hippo’s viral status, combined with the appeal of meme coins, has resulted in an unexpected success for this digital asset.Moo Deng’s internet fame has not only impacted the crypto world but also inspired beauty trends globally. Beauty and makeup influencers are drawing inspiration from the hippo’s pink, chubby cheeks and smooth skin to create looks based on her adorable features. This trend has gained significant momentum on social media, with influencers from various countries paying tribute to the internet's beloved hippo.In an interview with The Guardian, Moo Deng’s zookeeper expressed her surprise at the pygmy hippo’s viral fame. She mentioned that from the moment she saw Moo Deng, she knew the hippo would become famous, but she had only anticipated popularity in Thailand, not internationally.(This is a top story on Google Trends)","The Moo Deng meme coin is the latest addition to the growing list of meme-based cryptocurrencies.

The pink is due to a genetic mutation.""With infectious enthusiasm, Jamie explains the rarity of this encounter, noting that only 1% of people may have the chance to witness such a phenomenon in their lifetime.She goes on to reveal the scientific reason behind the grasshopper's unique coloration, attributing it to a genetic mutation that causes an overproduction of pink pigment and an underproduction of black.''Wow, I just found a pink grasshopper. There's like 1% of people can see pink grasshoppers in their lifetime. So, I am so lucky to be able to see it. Pink grasshoppers, the reason why they are pink is because of their genetic aberration, which means they produce too much pink pigment and not enough black. That's why there's so much pink,'' she explains in the video.Jamie's exceptional find has resonated with social media users, who have showered her with praise for her talent and genuine curiosity about the natural world.Her video went viral with people commenting like ""We need more kids like this who are in touch with nature and know their stuff.

Gilded Youth: An Intimate History of Growing Up in the

Royal Family

OK!

Kate Middleton , the Princess of Wales, has become known not only for her grace in public but also for her remarkably effective parenting style. As Prince George , Princess Charlotte , and Prince Louis grow older and attend more public events, royal watchers have noted their impeccable behavior.However, when things do go awry, Kate uses a unique method to keep her children disciplined, often employing a simple but effective phrase:In his book, royal expert Tom Quinn shed light on how the princess manages moments of mischief, such as when Prince Louis made headlines during the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee.During the event, Louis was seen sticking his tongue out at his mother, but rather than reacting harshly, Kate calmly used her signature phrase. According to Quinn, while seemingly harmless, these four words carry significant weight in the royal household. The children, understanding the cue, quickly fall back in line.Former staffers have praised Kate’s calm demeanour, noting that she prefers to let her children enjoy being kids and doesn’t overly stress about minor misbehavior. A source toldthat Kate ""doesn’t worry too much"" about her children’s behaviour and ""loves seeing them being kids."" Prince Louis, in particular, is described as an energetic child who occasionally struggles to contain his excitement during public engagements. However, his cheeky antics have often been met with humor by his parents, who even acknowledged them in a light-hearted thank-you note after the Jubilee.In contrast to more traditional approaches, the Prince and Princess of Wales prioritize open dialogue and a calm atmosphere at home. When one of their children experiences strong emotions or acts out, the royal couple opts for a ""sofa chat"" rather than isolating the child. This approach allows the children to process their feelings with guidance, rather than leaving them to manage their emotions alone. Notably, the couple adheres to a strict ""no shouting"" policy, ensuring a calm and nurturing environment even when discipline is necessary.William and Kate’s modern parenting methods, which blend discipline with empathy, continue to draw praise from experts and royal fans alike, reinforcing their image as dedicated and thoughtful parents.","Kate Middleton's signature phrase is: ""let's take a break"" royal expert Tom Quinn shed light on how the princess manages moments of mischief.

According to Politico , Vance's facial hair might represent what some consider a form of toxic masculinity , while Tim Walz ’s animated expressions, including his wide-eyed look, were interpreted as showcasing his emotional intensity and passion.The body langauge analysis was done by Joe Navarro, a former FBI agent and body language expert.It was noted that Vance is the first presidential candidate in eight decades to sport facial hair, and studies suggest voters often associate beards with masculinity. This association can be viewed positively, reflecting strength and competence, but it may also be seen negatively, especially by women, as signalling aggression and resistance to feminist values. Other commentators have similarly linked the Republican ticket to traditional notions of masculinity, contrasting it with the Democratic appeal, which they claim attracts men who are more supportive of women.While Vance's beard was critiqued, Walz’s eye movements were praised for emphasising his emotional engagement during debates. The expert explained that Walz's wide-eyed expression highlighted his strong feelings on issues, reminiscent of early human facial gestures meant to convey emotional urgency, such as alerting others to danger.The expert also highlighted how Vance effectively used hand gestures to convey leadership and emotion but pointed out that a small frown during a specific moment revealed a vulnerability. This expression, seen during a discussion on Project 2025, was interpreted as a sign that the topic was a sensitive one for Vance, showing a weakness that could be exploited by an opponent. At the same time, Walz was credited with using his own frowning expression to silently communicate disapproval during the debate.The analysis wasn’t entirely flattering for Walz either, with the expert noting that his finger-pointing at the camera came across as accusatory, reminiscent of the famous Uncle Sam posters. While this gesture demanded attention, it also risked being perceived as threatening.Both candidates were observed demonstrating ""Midwestern politeness"" by turning their bodies toward each other during the debate, a gesture that conveyed respect despite their disagreements.","JD Vance’s beard could be perceived as symbolising aggression and opposition to feminist ideals.

A viral Twitter post has credited JD Vance 's wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, for his impressive performance in the recent vice-presidential debate against Democratic candidate Tim Walz .“The reason JD Vance is so good in debates is because he has to argue with his Indian lawyer wife every day,” Pratik Patel's remark has garnered over a million views.The debate, hosted by CBS News , was a closely contested affair.A snap poll conducted shortly after the debate revealed that 42% of viewers believed Vance had come out on top, with 41% favoring Walz and 17% seeing it as a tie. Both candidates saw a boost in favorability ratings, with Vance’s score rising from 40% to 49%, and Walz increasing from 52% to 60%.Usha Vance , a prominent figure in JD's campaign, has played a crucial role behind the scenes, preparing him for this high-stakes event. USA Today reported that she was instrumental in shaping his responses and strategies, just as she had been during his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention .

She met JD at Yale, where she was recognised as one of the top students in Yale Law School, a fact echoed by her classmates.

What began as a thrilling day at Disney quickly spiraled into a nightmare for one family. Five-year-old Ernesto Tagle found himself in a life-or-death situation during a ride on the Guardians of the Galaxy : Cosmic Rewind, a popular enclosed rollercoaster that propels riders at speeds of up to 60 mph.The joyride took a terrifying turn just 20 seconds after the ride commenced when Ernesto suddenly stopped breathing.His mother, Christine Tagle, was seated directly behind him and vividly recalls the moment her heart sank. “I was screaming, hitting him, and saying something’s wrong,” Christine told Fox 35 recounting the harrowing experience.Once the nearly three-minute ride came to an end, the little boy's mother performed CPR while others rushed to assist. A passing couple—a nurse and an EMT—immediately stepped in to help. A Disney employee swiftly brought an automated external defibrillator (AED), which was used to restart Ernesto’s heart before he was rushed to a nearby hospital.Following extensive examinations, doctors diagnosed Ernesto with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia ( CPVT ), a rare heart rhythm disorder that can flare up during periods of intense excitement or physical activity.Ernesto's father later shared on Instagram that his son was recovering well. Doctors had placed a device in Ernesto's chest designed to treat life-threatening heart arrhythmias and sudden cardiac arrest . “I’m happy to say that Ernesto is doing well after surgery with no signs of brain or heart damage,” he wrote, including photos of the brave young boy in his hospital bed. “Even better, this warrior is already home and already asking to ride his motorcycle.”",Five-year-old Ernesto Tagle stopped breathing during a ride on the Guardians of the Galaxy : Cosmic Rewind.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Take a look at the post here



Pokemon Scarlet and Violet players may face a new fiery challenge in early October as Infernape, the popular fourth-generation Fire-type starter, takes over Seven-Star Tera Raid dens. Infernape is a significantly tougher opponent than the previous Serperior. It is known for its high speed and powerful attacks and will reportedly replace Serperior the Unrivaled as the next formidable Tera Raid boss.While possessing a versatile move set and impressive offensive stats, trainers should be wary of its low HP and susceptibility to Water, Flying, and Ground-type attacks.According to a report by Serebii.net, the fighting against Infernape the Unrivaled will commence on Thursday, October 3 at 8:00 pm EST (5.30 am IST) and continue until Sunday, October 6 at 7:59 pm EST (5.29 IST). A second opportunity to face this challenging foe will be available the following week, from October 10 to 13 at the same time.In a post on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Serebii.net shares all the details.Players can acquire Infernape in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet by catching a Chimchar in the Terarium's Polar Biome and evolving it. Prepare your teams and strategies to face this challenging opponent in the upcoming Tera Raids. The Infernape will boast the Rock-type as its Tera type and will reward successful trainers with the coveted Mightiest Mark.Just like previous Tera Raid bosses, Infernape the Unrivaled, will possess its Hidden Ability,Iron Fist , which will significantly amplify the power of its punching moves. Therefore, trainers should anticipate facing attacks like Mach Punch, Fire Punch, and Thunder Punch.Additionally, Infernape will utilise its Rock Tera type with moves such as Stone Edge or Rock Slide, potentially combining them with disruptive tactics like Taunt and Swords Dance. Despite the defensive nature of Rock-type Pokemon, Infernape's inherent fragility leaves it open to attacks from Water, Ground, and Fighting types.Trainers are advised to prepare their teams and strategies carefully to overcome this formidable opponent. Also, trainers preparing to challenge Infernape the Unrivaled should prioritise building teams with strong defences to withstand its powerful punches.","Pokemon Scarlet and Violet players may face a new fiery challenge in early October.

iPhone 15 scam: How a Bengaluru man caught fake Flipkart delivery man,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/iphone-15-scam-how-a-bengaluru-man-caught-fake-flipkart-delivery-man/articleshow/113840201.cms,"Take a look at the post here

Image credit: Reddit

A Bengaluru resident has exposed a delivery scam attempt. This scam involved a fake Flipkart delivery man who tried to deliver a fake package disguised as an iPhone 15. The resident, who had ordered an iPhone 15 with 256GB storage and opted for an open-box delivery , claims that a man dressed in a white t-shirt posed as a Flipkart delivery executive and attempted to hand over a sealed package.To prevent customers from receiving damaged or incorrect items, online retailers like Amazon and Flipkart often offer an ""open-box delivery"" option for high-value purchases. This allows customers to inspect the product before accepting the delivery, ensuring they receive exactly what they ordered. The imposter reportedly pressured the resident to accept the package without inspection, but fled the scene when the resident started recording the interaction.In the post, he wrote: “My sister bought an iPhone 15 with VIP on the Flipkart sale, it was an open box delivery. This loser (a guy in white) came with a big package to deliver claiming that he couldn't do an ‘open box delivery’. We have to accept it as is. I refused. He called some random people and they said there was no facility like that. He was scared shitless because I recorded all this. Telling his partners in crime in Kannada that I have recorded everything and all. I did not accept the package. Within two minutes another guy came to deliver a very small package and said that he would open the box before delivering it. We got the product because I recorded everything, otherwise I am sure he would have given me some random package.”At the end of the post also shared the pictures of the delivery executives . Here’s is the one who the customer flagged as a fake one:How users reacted to this postThe Reddit post got a lot of significant attention as it sparked a wave of users sharing similar concerns about trustworthiness and scams on online marketplaces . Many recounted their own experiences of receiving damaged, incorrect, or even empty packages despite opting for open-box deliveries.In the comments section, one user wrote: “Nice bro. Glad you knew something was off and recorded everything. It's very hard to trust Flipkart now. Their association with an insane amount of scammers in all delivery pipelines is really scary. It's really disturbing you know that Flipkart can't do or doesn't do anything about the scamming happening during the delivery.”Meanwhile, another user noted: “Just yesterday I received a laptop. Did an open box check, and even waited for the initial irritating Windows setup and upgrade to complete, to check that the processor and other details are as expected.In the past, Amazon sent me a laptop with a gen 4 i5 processor, instead of a gen 8, that I had ordered. And my stupid ass realised it after a year, when I ran some benchmarks.The Flipkart guy was obviously in a hurry, as I was clearly taking more time than I should have. (In my defence, I couldn't accept a 90k laptop, without being sure that it was the correct one)I finally have him 200 rupees, and then he was more than happy to wait for 45 minutes. He went ahead and made 2-3 more deliveries, then came back and took the OTP from me.I made a 40 minute long video, from the moment on unboxing, till verifying everything.The only reason I order costlier items from Flipkart and not Amazon, is for open box deliveries. If they do any drama in that, they can take it back.”",A Bengaluru resident has exposed a delivery scam attempt.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene , which caused extensive power outages and disrupted cellular service across Asheville, residents have turned to their iPhones’ satellite messaging feature for communication. This advanced functionality, available on iPhone 14 models and later versions, has been widely praised for its ability to help people stay connected during emergencies.As traditional communication networks went down, satellite messaging became a lifeline for many. Social media platforms were flooded with posts from Asheville residents, encouraging others to upgrade to iOS 18 to access the feature. This version of Apple 's operating system enables users to send and receive messages via satellite, bypassing the need for cellular service—proving especially critical in natural disasters.One Asheville resident, Matt Van Swol, shared on social media the impact of the feature: ""Due to the lack of cell service, EVERYONE in Asheville NC right now on iOS 18 has been able to get messages out and in with the satellite messaging feature."" His post highlighted the vital role the technology played in keeping people connected during the emergency.Many others echoed Van Swol’s sentiments, sharing personal stories of how satellite messaging allowed them to communicate with loved ones. One user recounted how the feature helped them notify their family in Georgia of their safety amidst the chaos caused by the hurricane.Despite the technology's benefits, not everyone had access to this capability. Business Insider’s Jeneane Nicodemus reported being unable to reach her daughter in Asheville for three days, illustrating that the feature’s availability is limited to newer iPhone models and specific Google Pixel devices.The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released data that further underscored the extent of the damage. By Monday at 9 a.m. ET, 370 out of 1,452 cell sites across North Carolina were still offline due to the widespread power outages caused by the storm.As the storm moved northward, social media became a hub for information on how to activate satellite messaging. Platforms like TikTok were flooded with tutorials on enabling the feature on iOS 18, providing critical guidance for those unfamiliar with the technology. This wave of educational content helped people stay informed, particularly as they faced uncertainty and limited connectivity.Though many people used satellite messaging to reassure family members of their safety, Apple has stressed the importance of the feature for emergency use. The company recommends utilizing satellite messaging primarily for contacting emergency services when immediate help is needed. However, its broader use during Hurricane Helene demonstrated its versatility as a communication tool during crises.As communities continue to rebuild in the wake of the hurricane, the widespread adoption of satellite messaging during this disaster showcases the potential of technology to keep people connected, even in the most challenging circumstances.","Satellite messaging allows users to send and receive messages via satellite, bypassing the need for cellular service.

“For those not aware, a few months ago after reaching out to me, YouTube contacted the App Store stating that Juno does not adhere to YouTube guidelines and modifies the website in a way they don’t approve of, and alludes to their trademarks and iconography.

I don’t personally agree with this, as Juno is just a web view, and acts as little more than a browser extension that modifies CSS to make the website and video player look more “visionOS” like. No logos are placed other than those already on the website, and the “for YouTube” suffix is permitted in their branding guidelines. Juno also doesn’t block ads in any capacity, for the curious.

I stated as much to YouTube, they wouldn’t really clarify or budge any, and as a result of both parties not being able to come to a conclusion I received an email a few minutes ago from Apple that Juno has been removed from the App Store.

Juno was a fun hobby project for me to build. As a developer I wanted to get some experience building for the Vision Pro, and as a user I wanted a nice way to watch YouTube on this cool new device. As a result I really enjoyed building Juno, but it was always something I saw as fundamentally an app I built for fun.

Because of that, I have zero desire to spin this into a massive fight (at least more than I’ve fought in emails over the last few months) akin to what happened with Reddit years ago. That’s kind of the opposite of fun. I hope that’s understandable.

For those who have Juno, to my knowledge it should continue to work fine until/unless the YouTube website updates in some fashion that breaks stuff. Sorry it had to end this way, I had some really cool stuff planned for it that I think would have been a lot of fun! It’s been genuinely awesome hearing all the kind words from Vision Pro users who have loved the app.”","Juno is a browser extension that modifies the YouTube website and video player to make it look more “visionOS” like.
