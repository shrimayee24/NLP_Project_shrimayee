Don't analyse the connections too deeply.

The game tends to employ simple links such as sounding similar, similar spellings, or common themes.

Example: ""dear"" and ""deer"" tend to be linked by sound, not by some elaborate relationship such as predator and prey.

You have only four guesses per puzzle per day, so every guess matters.

Don't mindlessly click—consider each set carefully before submitting.

Try to come up with at least three connected words confidently before trying a set.

The initial organization is deliberately mischievous to mislead you.

Shuffling the words may allow you to see new patterns or concealed connections.

Shuffle it as a routine to begin and whenever you are stuck.

'Pandering to black people': Megyn Kelly has a meltdown over Met Gala’s ‘dandyism’ tribute,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pandering-to-black-people-megyn-kelly-has-melt-down-over-met-galas-dandyism-tribute/articleshow/120982200.cms,"Poll Do you agree with Megyn Kelly's criticism of the 2025 Met Gala's theme? Yes, I agree with her. No, I disagree with her.

Megyn Kelly Declares ""The Met Gala is Dead"" and Calls Out Obscene Nudity and ""Rosa Parks on Crotch""





Megyn Kelly launched into a furious tirade against the 2025 Met Gala, slamming the prestigious fashion event as a “wannabe version of its old self” and accusing organisers of pandering to Black Americans with an “incomprehensible” theme.Speaking on Tuesday’s episode of The Megyn Kelly Show, the former Fox News anchor took aim at the gala’s theme “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” which celebrated Black dandyism and its influence on fashion. Kelly ridiculed the concept as elitist and politically driven, dismissing it as “leftist academic, gobbledygook, nonsensical talk.”“Once the apex of high fashion culture and A-list celebrity, the gala now looks more like a sad sack D-list past-its-prime wannabe version of its old self,” she said.“It’s closer to today’s Nerd Prom White House Correspondents Dinner than the centre of the celeb and beauty universe as it used to be.”Kelly openly mocked the theme’s intellectual basis, referencing Monica Miller’s 2009 book Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity, which inspired the Met exhibit. “So far we have dandyism, intersection and diasporic identity,” Kelly said. “We’re batting a thousand on the scale of leftist code language that will make liberals sound smarter and feel superior.”She went on to quote Miller’s description of Black dandyism, before blasting it as purposefully obtuse: “The whole point is to lose you and sound smarter than you by saying words that are totally empty and meaningless,” she said.Kelly accused the event of virtue-signalling, saying the gala’s true intent was to “pander to Black people because we love Black people and that makes us good people.” She described the night as “basically Black Lives Matter at the Met,” calling it “a parade of Black Americans, leftists in their dandy style.”“Near as I can figure,” she added, “it appears to mean over-the-top black and white with weird shapes and vaginas showing.”The annual Met Gala, co-chaired this year by stars like Colman Domingo, Pharrell Williams and Lewis Hamilton, was otherwise hailed by fashion critics for celebrating the elegance and defiance of Black style throughout history. But Kelly dismissed the celebration entirely, describing it as a self-congratulatory gathering of elites.“You’re not meant to understand this,” she concluded. “You dumbasses. You have to go to Harvard to understand what these people are saying, how they speak and how they code talk.”The Met Gala reportedly raised $31 million this year.",Megyn Kelly slammed the 2025 Met Gala as a ‘wannabe version of its old self’ Accused organisers of pandering to Black Americans with an ‘incomprehensible’ theme.

"Titanic survivor’s haunting letter written days before sinking sells for record £300,000 at auction; here’s what it said",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/titanic-survivors-haunting-letter-sells-for-record-300000-at-auction/articleshow/120680669.cms,"



A rare letter penned by Colonel Archibald Gracie , one of the Titanic’s most distinguished survivors, has fetched a record £300,000, a fivefold increase on its estimated price, at an auction in Wiltshire, as a new high price for Titanic correspondence was smashed.The letter, dated April 10, 1912, the very day Gracie boarded the Titanic, offers a chilling glimpse into the final days before disaster struck. Written on a Titanic letter card and postmarked in Queenstown and London, it is ominous in tone, with the following ominous words: ""It is a fine ship but I shall await my journey's end before I pass judgment on her.""Auctioneer Henry Aldridge and Son described it as ""a truly exceptional, museum-grade piece,"" saying it is the record price for a Titanic letter. Survivor letters of Gracie's stature are extremely rare, with this one never previously on the market.he four-page letter, written to a family acquaintance who befriended Gracie at the London Waldorf Hotel, is warm in its reminiscence about his earlier crossings on the Oceanic, remembering, ""Her sea-worthy qualities and yacht-like appearance make me miss her,"" while also marveling at the size of the Titanic.Days later, Gracie would be a participant in one of history's most horrific nights. Following an evening of squash, a dip in the ship's pool, and a Sunday church service, Gracie was rudely awakened at 11:40 pm by the abrupt shutdown of Titanic's engines. Without hesitation, he assisted women and children into lifeboats, procuring blankets to protect them from the cold.When the ship finally went down into the Atlantic waves, Gracie crawled onto an upturned collapsible boat with other survivors. In the blackness, frantic swimmers cried out for assistance, but fear of capsizing prevented those on board from taking on more. Gracie remembered with sorrow that over half the men holding on to the upturned boat died before dawn, exhausted and chilled.""In no instance, I am happy to say, did I hear any word of rebuke,"" Gracie wrote in his later memoir, The Truth About the Titanic, recounting the final moments of those left behind, some offering blessings rather than curses.Col. Gracie's eye-witness account is still one of the most detailed and graphic accounts of the tragedy. The auctioneers titled the letter an invaluable relic, ""It is impossible to overstate the rarity of this lot,"" they added. ""Written by one of the most famous survivors, it captures a moment frozen in time.""","Col. Archibald Gracie was one of the Titanic's most distinguished survivors.

"Watch: CBS anchor Tony Dokupil says Cardinals are rawdogging it at Papal Conclave, faces Catholic fury",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-cbs-anchor-tony-dokupil-says-cardinals-are-rawdogging-it-at-papal-conclave-faces-catholic-fury/articleshow/120968890.cms,"A Papal Process Cloaked in Tradition



“This Phrase and the Conclave Do Not Go Together”

A Pattern of Edgy Moments?



The Weight of Words in an Age of Virality



The Conclave Continues







In a moment that has since gone viral for all the wrong reasons, CBS anchor Tony Dokoupil stunned viewers with a slang-laden comment during a live segment covering the 2025 papal conclave. While discussing the cardinal-electors ’ isolation inside the Sistine Chapel, Dokoupil remarked that the Church leaders were “raw-dogging it,” a comment that ignited confusion, criticism, and no small amount of second-hand embarrassment across social media.The term “raw-dogging,” though it has entered popular slang with multiple informal uses, is widely known to refer to engaging in sexual activity without protection. Dokoupil’s use of the term in relation to the spiritual process of choosing the next head of the Roman Catholic Church left many viewersshocked and others simply baffled.To provide context, the conclave—derived from the Latin cum clave, meaning ""with a key""—is the centuries-old procedure by which the College of Cardinals elects the next pope. Following the death of Pope Francis on April 21, 2025, 133 cardinal-electors were called to the Vatican to participate in the secretive process.The rules are strict: no mobile phones, no internet access, no outside communication. The goal is to encourage divine inspiration rather than political interference or external influence.This digital blackout was the subject of discussion on CBS Mornings , with veteran Vatican correspondent John Allen explaining that the cardinals were entirely cut off from the outside world. Dokoupil chimed in, saying, “They’re raw-dogging the conclave—no phone, no text, no nothing.”Co-hosts Gayle King and Nate Burleson appeared momentarily stunned before continuing the segment with nervous laughter.The backlash was immediate. Social media platforms erupted with posts from viewers expressing everything from disbelief to outrage. Some commentators labelled it inappropriate, disrespectful, or tone-deaf, particularly given the solemnity of the event being covered. “This phrase and the conclave do not go together,” wrote one user on X (formerly Twitter). Another posted, “Just had to explain to my Catholic grandmother what ‘raw-dogging’ means. Thanks, CBS.”The term, while occasionally used in internet parlance to describe enduring something without assistance or support (e.g., “raw-dogging reality” or “raw-dogging a Monday without coffee”), still carries a sexually explicit connotation in most contexts. Its sudden appearance in a formal news segment about a sacred religious ritual was, for many, jarring.A few defenders of Dokoupil suggested that the anchor was attempting to use modern slang to appeal to younger viewers or inject humour into a long broadcast. But critics pointed out that there is a time and place for levity, and a centuries-old ecclesiastical election process likely isn’t one of them.This isn’t the first time Tony Dokoupil has attracted scrutiny for offbeat on-air behaviour. In 2023, he was involved in a tense interview with British actor Jason Isaacs over the Israel-Gaza conflict. Earlier this year, he received criticism for a segment with former NFL coach Bill Belichick that many viewers felt was unnecessarily combative.CBS has not issued a formal apology or statement on the matter. However, internal sources suggest the network is “reviewing viewer feedback.” As of Thursday morning, the clip continues to circulate widely online, racking up millions of views across X, TikTok, and YouTube, with most users expressing varying degrees of incredulity.The incident highlights the challenges that traditional news outlets face as they attempt to bridge generational and cultural gaps. Anchors today are expected to be both authoritative and relatable, informative yet conversational. The tightrope act between gravitas and informality often invites moments where things can go spectacularly wrong.“This is what happens when legacy news tries to cosplay TikTok,” one user commented. Another added, “If you wouldn’t say it in a church, maybe don’t say it during coverage of the conclave.”The Vatican has not commented on the incident, nor is it likely to. The Holy See tends to remain silent on Western media mishaps, particularly when they come from outside Catholic circles. But among Catholics and those familiar with the sacredness of the papal election, the reaction has ranged from bemusement to offence.Meanwhile, the conclave itself is proceeding in strict adherence to tradition. Cardinals from across the world are secluded inside the Vatican’s Apostolic Palace, voting in secrecy under Michelangelo’s frescoed ceiling. When a new pope is chosen, white smoke will rise from the Sistine Chapel chimney, signalling to the world that a successor to Pope Francis has been elected.Until then, journalists covering the event would do well to choose their words with care. While modern idioms may seem catchy or relatable in other contexts, applying them to one of the most sacred and time-honoured processes in religious history is a misstep that even the most seasoned anchors might live to regret.","CBS anchor Tony Dokoupil stunned viewers with a slang-laden comment during a live segment covering the 2025 papal conclave.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Grand Theft Auto VI will launch on May 26, 2026, according to Rockstar’s announcement on May 2, 2025.

Why was GTA 6 delayed from 2025?

Rockstar stated that the delay was to ensure the game meets the quality expectations of players and the studio’s own development standards.

Although not officially confirmed, GTA 6 is expected to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Will there be new trailers before the release?

Yes, Rockstar has confirmed that more information and footage will be released in the months following the release date announcement.

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for GTA 6, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

Coding skills remain valuable despite rapid AI advancement

Google DeepMind research scientist Stefania Druga believes young people are using artificial intelligence in disappointing ways, primarily to complete homework assignments rather than as a tool for creative collaboration.""The way they're using it right now, in my opinion, is really disappointing,"" Druga told Business Insider. ""But it's not their fault.It's the way these technologies were designed.""Druga, who created the AI education platform Cognimates , argues that students should be developing AI literacy ""as early as they can speak"" and learning to use AI tools as creative partners rather than homework solvers.According to Druga, the problem lies partly in outdated educational frameworks. ""We should be changing the whole framework.

Aaron Rodgers urged to quit NFL and join TV by legendary Hall of Famer



As the dust settles from the 2025 NFL Draft and teams begin gearing up for mini-camps, the future of Aaron Rodgers remains one of the hottest topics in football. At 41, the four-time MVP has been at the center of speculation—will he return to the gridiron or finally hang up his cleats? While fans and analysts have been divided, one unexpected voice has joined the conversation with a decisive opinion: Hall of Famer DeMarcus Ware.Appearing on Up & Adams with Kay Adams, Ware didn’t mince words when asked what Aaron Rodgers should do next.Rather than imagining a blockbuster move or a triumphant return, Ware offered something far more sobering and sincere: a call to retire.“That’s hard. I don’t know. I mean, right now, where I think Aaron Rodgers should go — I think he should hang the cleats up,” Ware said, pausing with clear deliberation.Coming from anyone else, the comment might feel like media noise. But Ware, a man who walked away from the game at 34 despite still having gas in the tank, speaks from experience—and with gravity. After logging 138.5 sacks across 12 seasons and becoming one of the most feared pass rushers in NFL history, Ware knew when to stop. He didn’t wait for his body to force his hand. Instead, he chose long-term health over short-term accolades.“I think that with me being the first guy out of our class to make the Hall of Fame, I know he’ll probably be No. 2 out of our class and I think he needs to put that jacket on and say he’s the best of the best, there’s nothing he needs to accomplish, and go from there,” Ware explained.It’s not just about trophies or legacy. Ware pointed to something deeper—something only athletes with battle-worn bodies can truly understand.“I think he has a lot to give. I had a lot to give my last year, too. I had an opportunity to say, ‘You know what? I’m done,’ and because my body was hurting so bad,” Ware shared. “It’s great to come back and say, ‘I still can do it,’ but I’m thinking about the permanent damage that can be caused when you go back out there and you hurt yourself again at that age and you try to recover.”Rodgers has battled through injuries, setbacks, and comebacks. While fans may be thrilled by the idea of watching him in a Steelers uniform—especially after Pittsburgh traded wide receiver George Pickens to Dallas—it might not be worth the risk. With fewer offensive weapons and an aging body, the challenge only becomes greater.“Yes, I feel like I can go out and get 15.0 more sacks. I could,” Ware added. “But what is that worth? Like, what is it worth to your family? What is it worth to just where you are in your career?”It’s a sobering perspective, and it adds depth to a debate that often focuses too heavily on what fans want to see rather than what’s best for the player. Ware even drew parallels to Tom Brady, saying, “He hung it up because he wanted to, not because they pushed him out.”Rodgers, known for doing things on his own terms, is likely weighing these same questions. Walking away isn’t easy for someone who’s still capable of making an impact. But walking away with your health, legacy, and dignity intact? That’s a power move in itself.Kay Adams pushed back slightly, suggesting that Rodgers still has something to offer on the field. But even she admitted that media work doesn’t quite seem like his next chapter—he’s unpredictable, cerebral, and rarely follows the expected route.Still, Ware’s message is loud and clear: sometimes the smartest move is knowing when to stop. Whether Rodgers suits up for one last ride or chooses to enter the Hall of Fame race early, the conversation around his legacy is already underway.He’s earned the right to leave on his own terms. The question now is—will he?Also Read: NFL sparks political firestorm by having President Trump announce 2027 Draft from the White House","Hall of Famer DeMarcus Ware says Aaron Rodgers should retire from the NFL and pursue broadcasting.

Steelers trading George Pickens may solve a lingering Patriots offensive issue overnight



Why Steelers didn't trade George Pickens before 2025 NFL Draft | Pro Football Talk | NFL on NBC

George Pickens is officially headed to Dallas, and while the New England Patriots weren't directly involved in the trade, they might just be one of the biggest beneficiaries of it. On Wednesday, the Pittsburgh Steelers sent the talented yet polarizing wide receiver to the Cowboys in exchange for a 2026 third-round pick, along with a late-round pick swap in 2027.The move sent shockwaves across the AFC, and for New England, it could not have come at a better time.The Patriots have already had a strong offseason. Between bold free-agent signings and a promising 2025 NFL Draft class, they’ve reshaped their roster with both immediate impact players and future stars. But the one thing they didn’t do? Trade for George Pickens. Given their need to build a strong support system around rookie quarterback Drake Maye , many expected them to at least explore a deal for the former Georgia standout. Instead, New England doubled down on their own vision, adding veteran Mack Hollins in free agency and drafting Stefon Diggs and Kyle Williams to strengthen the wide receiver room.Clearly, the Patriots had a different plan for their offensive identity. And it may be paying off already.With Pickens out of Pittsburgh, the Steelers lose one of their few legitimate playmakers. Their offense was already under scrutiny, and now, without a reliable deep threat, the pressure on their quarterback and offensive scheme only intensifies. Factor in a daunting 2025 schedule — including matchups against the tough NFC North and the AFC East — and Pittsburgh may find themselves slipping in a tightly packed Wild Card race.That’s where New England quietly gains an edge.The Patriots not only face the Steelers at home this upcoming season but also bring to that matchup a secondary that’s gotten significantly better. With Carlton Davis now lined up across from breakout star Christian Gonzalez, it’s going to be tough sledding for any opposing quarterback. History is also on New England’s side — they’ve won the last three meetings against Pittsburgh, and the odds might tilt even further in their favor this time around.In a conference where the top contenders like the Chiefs, Bengals, and Bills often dominate headlines, the battle for the Wild Card will be brutal. Every stumble by a middle-tier team like Pittsburgh is an opportunity for the Patriots to slide ahead. While they didn’t land George Pickens, the ripple effect of his departure from the AFC could be just the boost they need.Sometimes, the best move is the one you don’t make — and for New England, this might just be one of those moments.Also Read: How George Pickens' style of play aligns with the Cowboys' offensive strategy","The Pittsburgh Steelers traded wide receiver George Pickens to the Dallas Cowboys on Wednesday.

Fortnite set to return to iPhones: What It means for gamers and the broader App Store battle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/fortnite/fortnite-set-to-return-to-iphones-what-it-means-for-gamers-and-the-broader-app-store-battle/articleshow/121000640.cms,"Image via EPic Games



Epic Games vs Apple: A conflict years in the making

After nearly five years, Fortnite is making its much-awaited return to the iOS App Store in the United States, marking a turning point in the long-running legal battle between Epic Games and Apple. The announcement follows a decisive U.S. court ruling that found Apple in contempt for sidestepping an earlier injunction aimed at promoting fair competition.Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney confirmed that the battle royale sensation would be back on iPhones this week.Though a specific date has not been shared, the court has made it clear there will be no tolerance for delays. “Time is of the essence,” noted Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in the ruling.The legal feud began in 2020 when Epic Games introduced a direct payment method in Fortnite, bypassing Apple's 15–30% commission fees. Apple responded by removing the game from the App Store, prompting Epic to sue Apple for anti-competitive practices.Although Apple initially won on several counts, the court ruled in 2021 that Apple must allow developers to inform users about alternative payment options. However, Apple introduced new rules and commissions for external links, effectively limiting competition. Judge Rogers deemed this a violation of the injunction’s spirit in her April 30 ruling.Epic hailed the court's decision, with Sweeney proclaiming that Apple’s fees are “now just as dead here in the United States of America as they are in Europe under the Digital Markets Act.”Apple has filed an emergency motion with the U.S. Court of Appeals, seeking to delay the mandated App Store changes. The company argues that the ruling unfairly forces it to give away access to its platform and may cost it billions in lost revenue.Epic Games, however, isn’t backing down. The company stated that Apple’s move is a “last-ditch effort to block competition” and confirmed that Fortnite’s iOS return will proceed as planned.Beyond gaming, Fortnite’s return has wider implications for Epic’s metaverse ambitions. The platform has evolved into a virtual social space, hosting concerts, brand collaborations, and cross-platform play.Epic’s recent multi-billion-dollar partnership with Disney aims to create an “entertainment universe” within Fortnite, further merging gaming with immersive storytelling.For now, iPhone users can expect Fortnite’s return to unlock more than gameplay - it could signal a shift in how apps and platforms interact in the digital future.","Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney confirmed that the battle royale sensation would be back on iPhones this week.
