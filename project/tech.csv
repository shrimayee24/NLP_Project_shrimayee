heard

saw

Growing up, I never heard a single swear word or indecent expression at home. The harshest one I remember was the rare reprimand, “Don’t be stupid”, from our mother which would send my sisters and me into tears for hours.In those days, decency was a non-negotiable virtue, and profanity, even when uttered by fringe voices, remained contained in the shadows, by a world untouched by social media's omnipresence. Public meetings with foul-mouthed speakers were forbidden territory.But today, the dam has burst.Words, once abandoned and found only rarely in Harold Robinson novels, are now flung around like stones in the street. The once-hushed four-letter words now find their way into our films and homes, seeping into innocent ears. College corridors ring with sexually explicit banter, and the virtual world overflows with vulgarity masquerading as stand-up comedy or free speech.Even amidst this, a recent political speech shocked the conscience of many. Delivered by a senior leader holding high office, it was a cocktail of crudeness—misogynistic, irreverent, and peppered with deliberate obscenity.Yes, free speech is the bedrock of a thriving democracy. But when profanity is dressed up as freedom, when it targets some genders, communities and denigrates symbols held sacred, it ceases to be expression and becomes aggression.It is at such junctures that the wisdom of Thiruvalluvar shines with piercing clarity.In the chapter titled “The Power of Speech”, he writes:Valluvar places this couplet in the section meant for ministers who advise kings, wield power, and influence the masses. Why? Because words, in the hands of the powerful, are like fire in the hands of a sorcerer—they can illuminate or incinerate.The—the Book of Wealth in—is often considered a manual on governance. Scholars further divide it into guidelines for kings, ministers, and frameworks for good governance. The fact that speech is highlighted in the ministerial section is no coincidence. Valluvar saw what many modern minds often overlook: governance isn't just about policies, it's about poise.Science is increasingly acknowledging the power of language on human perceptions. A study at the University of Wisconsin-Madison subjected participants to mismatched visuals and audio. When they were shown an image of a tiger but told it was a bear, their brains believed what theyrather than what they. The takeaway? Language doesn’t just describe reality; it shapes it.imagine the influence of a public speech. Every word carries a weight far heavier than the breath that bore it. It moulds opinions, cements prejudices, or inspires action. A speech cannot be separated from the speaker; words are but a larger picture of one’s inner self.Let every speaker ask himself or herself a question before stepping onto the stage:“Would I say these words in front of my daughter or granddaughter?” If that falters, the script must change.In an era that prizes volume over value, it is all the more vital that we return to the wisdom of restraint, prescribed by Valluvar.Let us choose our words with care. For they are not just sounds.They are seeds.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120404555,imgsize-76494,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/120404555.jpg"
Is Taylor Swift too ‘white bread’ for Coachella’s cool crowd? Exploring the pop queen’s place in festival culture,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/is-taylor-swift-too-white-bread-for-coachellas-cool-crowd-exploring-the-pop-queens-place-in-festival-culture/articleshow/120382497.cms,"Is Taylor Swift too mainstream for Coachella (Image via Getty Images)

Is Taylor Swift too mainstream for Coachella’s indie vibe?

When it comes to music festivals like Coachella, image matters just as much as the music. It’s not just about who performs—it’s about who belongs. So when Taylor Swift is rumored to make an appearance or even perform, one question keeps popping up: is Taylor Swift too “white bread” for Coachella’s trend-setting, genre-bending scene?On paper, Taylor Swift has the résumé to own any stage. With record-breaking albums, a sold-out Eras Tour, and a massive global fanbase, she’s arguably the biggest pop star on the planet. But Coachella is more than just a concert—it’s a cultural moment, curated for cool. It’s where edgy, experimental, and often underground artists get their shine. It’s where alternative fashion reigns and mainstream pop can sometimes feel… out of place.So why the “white bread” label? It stems from the perception that Taylor Swift’s music—despite its evolution—is still rooted in polished, safe storytelling. While she’s dabbled in indie folk with Folklore and Evermore, and even worked with edgy producers like Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner, some still see her as the girl-next-door in a world full of rebellious misfits.Yet that assumption overlooks her savvy reinventions. Taylor has consistently pushed boundaries in her own way—whether it’s re-recording her masters to reclaim her artistry, calling out industry sexism, or subtly weaving political themes into her music. She’s clean-cut, yes, but not without edge. Maybe she’s not flipping off the crowd in a studded leather jacket—but she’s rewriting the rules in a sparkly bodysuit, and doing it on her own terms.The reality is, Coachella has changed too. The lineup now spans everything from reggaeton and K-pop to hip-hop and house. The festival has become a melting pot of genres and identities. If Blink-182, Billie Eilish, and Bad Bunny can all share the same stage, why not Taylor?Also Read: Did Taylor Swift skip Coachella 2025 to avoid being upstaged by other stars? Fans question her absence amid rising speculation Whether she ever headlines or just shows up to support friends (like boyfriend Travis Kelce or producer pals), her presence sparks conversation. And maybe that’s the point. Because if Taylor Swift isn’t Coachella enough—then maybe it’s time to ask what Coachella really stands for in 2025.After all, being too “white bread” might just be the boldest thing you can be in a world obsessed with crust.","Is Taylor Swift too mainstream for Coachella’s indie vibe?

La La Anthony on Hustle, Knowing Your Worth, and Being “Rich” | Richer Lives by SoFi

American TV personality, former MTV VJ, and former basketball player Carmelo Anthony ’s ex-wife, La La Anthony , has shared how her life changed after their divorce , despite being financially independent. She recently called Carmelo the “best dad” for always being there for their son. However, when speaking about herself, she said that she doesn’t have anyone to have her back. The two have been co-parenting their son, Kiyan Anthony , since their divorce.La La Anthony recently opened up about her work, life after divorce and her son during a chat with Vivian Tu on the show Richer Lives. The couple welcomed son Kiyan in 2007, got married in 2010 and got divorced in 2021. Despite being a successful TV personality and actor, La La opened up about losing her backing post her divorce with Carmelo Anthony.La La also didn’t mince words in praising her ex-husband when it came to what he does for their son. She said that she learnt to co-parent as they navigated the new space. “My son’s dad is the greatest dad I know and I am just so blessed that we have a child together. My son gets to experience having two incredible parents and having a dad like he does,” she said on the show. Kiyan has grown into a successful basketball player with a NIL valuation of $1 million.Opening her heart on how things changed after the divorce, she said, “You’re on your own at that point… and that puts a different responsibility, sometimes a different amount of pressure. Before, I was always financially independent, but in the back of my mind, I knew if anything happens, at least I have this person to help me or bail me out. You realise it’s just you. That just puts a different responsibility, sometimes a different amount of pressure. I am the person that everyone in my family calls. I don’t have anyone to call. There’s pressure there, but I don’t mind it.”La La has, however, held the fort well for the sake of her son and confirmed that she has always been present for his special moments. “For the most part, he can say that my mom’s always been there for all of my moments. Having a child automatically makes you realign your focus and your priorities. I schedule everything around my son. When I leave here, I’m going to Augusta because he has a basketball tournament,” she said.Also Read: Michael Jordan’s viral dance to Kendrick Lamar’s ‘Not like us’ makes waves, and Carmelo Anthony weighs in on the GOAT’s request La La started early as a MTV VJ and earned a name for herself even before becoming the so-called “first lady of NBA”.

She stressed on how she doesn’t let money drive her decisions and has taught the same thing to Kiyan when it comes to being associated with brand endorsements. Sharing the advice she gave to her son, she said, “Don’t be related to brands just for money, do things you are passionate about. It’s about your word and reputation.”","Carmelo Anthony's ex-wife, La La Anthony, has opened up about her life after divorce. She has been co-parenting their son, Kiyan Anthony, since their divorce.

Sanchez, 55, collaborated with Monse co-founders Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim starting in late 2024 to design suits that balance function with style. “Usually, these suits are made for a man,” Sánchez told The New York Times, explaining that previous suits were merely tailored for women. The new designs include features like calf zippers for flared legs, aiming to be both flattering and functional.Sánchez described the suits as “elegant” with “a little spice,” while Garcia cited motocross outfits and ski suits as inspirations, emphasizing simplicity with a “dangerous” edge. “I almost put a corset in your suit,” Garcia teased Sánchez, who said she would have embraced it. Sánchez stressed the importance of functionality, recalling prototype tests where she stretched and bent to ensure durability, saying, “Let’s make sure it doesn’t split up the back in space.”The crew also shared their pre-flight glam plans with Elle. “Who would not get glam before the flight?!” Sánchez said, noting they’ll wear lash extensions in the capsule. Perry, 40, added, “Space is going to finally be glam. We are going to put the ‘ass’ in astronaut.” King, 70, joined in the excitement for their stylish space debut.Announced in February 2025, the mission highlights a shift toward inclusivity in space exploration, with the crew’s custom suits symbolizing both innovation as well as empowerment.","An all-female crew will launch on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin ’s first all- female space mission.

TOI Correspondent from London:

Over the years, patrons of Britain’s oldest Indian restaurant, ‘Veeraswamy’, have included Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Charlie Chaplin, Winston Churchill, Marlon Brando, Sharon Stone and David Cameron.A haunt of Indian maharajas and European royalty too, the King of Denmark even shipped out a cask of Carlsberg for staff to store for whenever he dined there.Now the Michelin-starred restaurant , which opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London, and today serves pineapple curry and chicken makhana au vin, is at threat of closure as the Crown Estate (property portfolio owned by King Charles), which owns Victory House, the building in which the restaurant is based, is refusing to renew its lease, which expires in June.The Crown Estate claims it needs to take the restaurant space back to extend the ground floor reception for offices on the building’s upper floors. Knocking through into Veeraswamy would give it an extra 11 sq mts.Veeraswamy’s founder, Edward Palmer, was the great-grandson of General William Palmer, and his wife, Begum Faiz Baksh, a Mughal princess. Gen Palmer was private secretary to Warren Hastings, first governor-general of the Presidency of Fort William. It was acquired by Ranjit Mathrani and Namita Panjabi in 1996.“Had they wanted to, they could’ve easily put the office reception on the first floor. I think they’ve come to the view that it’s too tiresome having a restaurant there, they want it to be all offices,” Mathrani (81), told the Times of London.If the Crown Estate refuses to allow the restaurant to stay put until he finds and fit out an alternative space, with its iconic décor inspired by the art nouveau of the 1920s and maharaja’s palaces, the restaurant will have to close, leading to possible redundancies and loss of business until a new site is found.Mathrani is taking the Crown Estate to court.A spokesperson for The Crown Estate told TOI: “The Crown Estate has a duty to generate value for the nation, while acting as responsible stewards for this historic part of London. We need to carry out a comprehensive refurbishment of Victory House. This includes a major upgrade to the offices and improving the entrance to make it more accessible. Due to the limited options available in this listed building we need to remove the entrance to the restaurant, which means we will not be able to offer Veeraswamy an extension when their lease expires.”","Michelin-starred restaurant Veeraswamy opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London.

Poll Should archaeological sites be preserved for historical and religious significance? Only if funds are available Absolutely, they are vital

Archaeologists working at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem have uncovered evidence of an ancient garden, aligning with biblical accounts . The excavation has revealed seeds and pollen from olive trees and grapevines, potentially dating back around 2,000 years.The discovery supports a passage in the New Testament, John 19:41, which states, ""Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.""Francesca Stasolla , an archaeology professor at the Sapienza University of Rome, confirmed the findings and emphasized their significance in an interview with Fox News Digital. She explained that the organic material was discovered in layers from a time when the site transitioned from a quarry to a funerary location.""The quarry had to be gradually abandoned and as the stone extraction ended it was used for agricultural areas and tombs,"" Stasolla said. ""This must have been what it looked like in the 1st century AD""Excavations at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre mark the first major restoration project at the revered Christian site in nearly two centuries. The work is taking place in areas shared by different religious communities .The site itself has a long and complex history. Originally built in 326 AD, the church was destroyed in 1009 AD under the orders of Islamic ruler al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah. It was later reconstructed by Christian Crusaders in the 12th century.""The current church is that of the Crusader reconstruction, but the whole church is a composition of historical phases from the fourth century to the modern age,"" Stasolla explained.The area’s religious and historical importance is evident in the many artifacts found during the excavation. Objects dating as far back as the Iron Age, including ceramics, metal, and glass, offer evidence of the site's long history as a place of worship.""Ceramics, metals, glass… [all] document both the occupation of the area and the presence of believers and pilgrims,"" Stasolla noted, adding that the goal of the excavation is to deepen understanding of the region’s religious significance.When asked whether the recent findings reinforce the biblical reference to a garden at the site of Christ’s crucifixion, Stasolla acknowledged the connection while clarifying the role of archaeology.""Archaeology provides us with data that must then be historicized and interpreted,"" she said. ""In this case, it documents an agricultural use of the quarry… [the Bible quote] is certainly suggestive [of this].""The excavation remains ongoing, and according to Stasolla, more discoveries are expected. ""It is certainly a strategic excavation for the knowledge of the development of the city and its process of sacralization in a Christian key,"" she said.","Archaeologists working at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem have uncovered evidence of an ancient garden.

Europeans Need Permit To Enter Uk, Trumps Reciprocal Tariffs Begin April 2

UK has introduced a new online entry requirements for European visitors from Wednesday, implementing a digital Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) permit as part of enhanced security measures.European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9. The system has already been operational for visitors from America, Canada and other visa-exempt nations since Britain's EU departure in 2020.UK border force chief Phil Douglas confirmed this implementation as part of a broader global rollout, emphasising its primary function as a security measure.The system aims to expedite entry procedures whilst enabling background checks on immigration history and criminal records. Douglas highlighted that approved travellers would benefit from faster border crossing through eGates.""The quid pro quo for the individual, though, is that we are building a contactless border, so if they're cleared for entry, they'll be able to use our new eGates and they'll be able to go through the border much more quickly,"" he added.During the initial buffer period, expected to continue until ""September or October,"" travellers can still proceed with their journeys. The ETA remains valid for two years, permitting stays up to six months.Applications opened to Europeans in March, covering approximately 30 countries, excluding Ireland. Applicants must submit passport photos and facial images through a smartphone app or government website, typically taking 10 minutes to complete.Whilst most applications receive swift responses, authorities advise allowing three working days. The requirement extends to all ages, though transit passengers not crossing UK borders are exempt following Heathrow Airport's concerns about European connection traffic.Heathrow, which handled 84 million passengers in 2024 with one-third from the EU, initially launched the scheme for Qatar in 2023 before expanding to Gulf nations. By January, it included about 50 additional countries including Argentina, South Korea and New Zealand.","European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Supporters use “woke” to describe people who are socially conscious and trying to make the world fairer.

Critics often use “wokeism” negatively, saying it means being too politically correct, overly sensitive, or pushing social ideas too far.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently replied to an X post calling out Netflix for its woke content. An X user recently named Gunther Eagleman @GuntherEagleman wrote on X: “Netflix is woke trash.” The post caught Musk’s attention who responded to it in agreement, saying “True”. Elon Musk’s reply to Gunther Eagleman’s post reflects his critique of Netflix. Earlier this month, the tech CEO slammed the streaming platform for its latest web series Adolescence, alleging an “anti-white propaganda”.As mentioned above, this is notably not the first time when the tech billionaire has criticised Netflix for its content. In the year 2022, Musk said that “The woke mind virus is making Netflix unwatchable."" He was responding to a post by Slashdot, referring to a subscriber loss of the streaming platform then.Musk, in reply to a user then, also said that he hopes the streaming giant would make more science fiction movies. “Can they please just make sci-fi/fantasy at least *mostly* about sci-fi/fantasy?” he tweeted.Musk has been a critique of wokeness calling it “divisive, exclusionary and hateful” in the past. He told The Babylon Bee that “woke mind virus” is “a world without humor”, stating that wokeness is the greatest threat to modern civilisation. “At its heart, wokeness is divisive, exclusionary and hateful. It basically gives mean people a shield to be cruel, armored in false virtue,"" Musk said.In an interview last year, Musk said that the woke mind virus killed his son, referring to his son Xavier, now known as Vivian Jenna Wilson. He then shared his concern about using puberty blockers in children and said he felt he was “tricked” into agreeing to his son’s sex change.For those wondering, Wokeism refers to a set of beliefs or attitudes that emphasize being socially aware, especially about issues like racism, gender identity, inequality, and injustice.

For those who do not know, Studio Ghibli is an esteemed Japanese animation studio known for movies like Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro, and Howl's Moving Castle. Their distinctive hand-drawn art is easily recognizable, characterized by soft, muted colors, playful characters, and scenes that look straight out of a story book!

Step 3: Choose the Right Animation Software

Step 4: Import and Organize Your Assets

Step 5: Add Frame-by-Frame Motion and Transitions

Step 6: Incorporate Atmospheric Effects and Lighting

Step 7: Sync with Audio and Sound Design

Step 8: Render and Export Your Animated Video

If you’ve been scrolling through social media lately --be it Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok -- you would have surely noticed the Ghibli-style photo trend taking over feeds everywhere. Those dreamy, pastel-hued images of whimsical forests, wide-eyed characters, and soft golden light straight out of a Studio Ghibli film have gone viral, racking up likes, shares, and endless “how did they do that?” comments. It's been almost a week, and this aesthetic obsession shows no signs of slowing down, with creators using AI tools, hand-drawn art, and photo edits to channel the magic of My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited Away. But why stop at static photos? Let’s ride this wave and turn your Ghibli-style masterpieces into an animation video that’ll have your followers hitting “replay.” Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create a short animation video inspired by the iconic Studio Ghibli aesthetic:The viral buzz started with fans and creators posting Ghibli-inspired snapshots—think lush landscapes and soulful characters, often AI-generated with tools like Midjourney or hand-drawn by digital artists. To join in, you’ll need your own photos ready.Grab or Create Your Images: If you’ve already posted a viral Ghibli-style pic, use that! Otherwise, whip one up with a prompt like “Studio Ghibli-style sunset village, soft colors, detailed” in an AI tool, or sketch it yourself in Procreate.Layer Like a Pro: Split your photo into parts—characters, trees, sky—for animation flexibility. Social media loves those multi-depth shots, and it’s perfect for what’s next.Ghibli’s charm lies in its quiet, heartfelt storytelling, and your animation can capture that—even in a 15-second clip that’s perfect for TikTok’s algorithm.Quick Sketch: Plan a mini-sequence. Maybe your character walks through a glowing forest, or a breeze scatters cherry blossoms. Keep it simple but enchanting—social media thrives on “ooh” moments.Frame Rate Flex: Go for 24 FPS (Ghibli’s cinematic sweet spot). A 10-second viral hit needs 240 frames, but don’t sweat it—software will fill the gaps.To animate Ghibli-style illustrations, you’ll need software that supports frame-by-frame animation, layering, and smooth transitions. Some of the best options include:Adobe After Effects : Ideal for advanced users, offering powerful animation tools and visual effects.Blender: A free, open-source 3D software that allows for detailed animation and rendering.Procreate Dreams: Huge on iPad-toting artists in this trend—hand-draw frames for that authentic Ghibli feel.RunwayML: AI fans love this for interpolating motion between images, cutting down work while keeping it share-worthy.CapCut: Free, fast, and TikTok-friendly for quick edits if you’re new to this.Once you’ve selected your software:Import all your Ghibli-style images into the software.Organize assets by layers (backgrounds, midgrounds, and foregrounds).Group character movements or effects into separate layers for better control.To create smooth animations:Keyframe Animation: Set keyframes at major points to define object positions and movements.Tweening: Fill in the frames between keyframes to achieve smooth transitions.Parallax Effect: Create depth by animating foreground and background layers independently.Studio Ghibli’s charm lies in its attention to environmental details. To replicate this:Add Particle Effects: Animate rain, leaves, or fireflies to create a magical ambiance.Adjust Lighting and Shadows: Use soft, dynamic lighting to evoke different moods.Simulate Camera Movements: Incorporate slow pans, zooms, and tracking shots for a cinematic effect.No Ghibli-inspired animation is complete without a captivating soundtrack.Background Score: Choose soothing, orchestral music that evokes nostalgia and wonder.Ambient Sounds: Add subtle environmental sounds (rustling leaves, chirping birds) for realism.Dialogue and Foley: Sync character speech and sound effects to the animation timeline.After perfecting your animation:Choose the appropriate export settings for your platform.Ensure a high-resolution export (1080p or 4K) for crisp visuals.Test your video for any frame drops or inconsistencies before finalizing.Users must be mindful of copyright restrictions when using AI-generated images, especially for commercial purposes as using copyrighted images as input could raise legal issues.","Studio Ghibli is an esteemed Japanese animation studio known for movies like Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro, and Howl's Moving Castle.

Union Minister for Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw introduced the app during the third edition of Aadhar Samvaad.The app, currently in beta testing, allows users to share only necessary data through secure digital means with their explicit consent. ""Now with just a tap, users can share only the necessary data, giving them complete control over their personal information,"" Vaishnaw said in a post shared on Twitter.Verification through the new app works similarly to UPI payments, where users can authenticate their identity by scanning QR codes at hotels, shops, airports, and other verification points. The facial recognition feature adds an additional security layer, ensuring only the rightful owner can authorize information transfer.""No need to hand over Aadhaar photocopy at hotel receptions, shops or during travel,"" the minister noted, highlighting the app's convenience for everyday scenarios.The app’s features include 100% digital and secure identity verification , protection against data misuse or leaks, and prevention of document forgery. The app represents a significant upgrade from its predecessor with a more user-friendly interface and enhanced privacy safeguards.Initially available to a select group including participants of the Aadhaar Samvaad event, UIDAI plans to release the app widely following user feedback.

The article notes that, once scaled up for mass integration, it has the potential to revolutionize existing storage architecture completely.Developed by scientists at Fudan University, Poxiao breaksexisting speed barriers, operating 100,000 times faster than conventional flash memory. The device, smaller than a grain of rice, is designed to bridge the gap between memory and computing, potentially eliminating bottlenecks in AI processing and high-speed data applications.Traditional flash memory relies on floating-gate transistors, which require a “warm-up” phase before electrons can move efficiently. The Fudan research team introduced a new approach, called “2D-enhanced hot-carrier injection”, allowing electrons to transition instantly from low-speed to high-speed states without delay.While the current prototype holds only kilobytes of data, researchers believe Poxiao’s design could lead to next-generation storage solutions that match the speed of AI processing.

Walmart outage: Service restoration and customer reactions

Walmart’s online store is back up and running after a major outage left thousands of customers unable to browse products or complete purchases. The disruption, which began around 3:00 p.m. ET, affected both the Walmart website and mobile app, preventing users from searching for items or adding them to their carts.Reports from Downdetector showed over 3,600 outage complaints at the peak of the incident. Customers took to social media platforms like X to express frustration, with many encountering error messages such as “We’re having technical issues , but we’ll be back in a flash.”While Walmart has not officially commented on the cause of the outage, some experts speculate that it may have been server-related or linked to routine maintenance issues.By 6:45 p.m. ET, reports of outages had dropped significantly, with most users able to search for products, access category pages, and complete transactions. Some customers noted that functionality was restored gradually, with certain features coming back online before others.The outage follows similar disruptions experienced by Zoom and Spotify earlier this week, raising concerns about widespread technical failures across major platforms.As Walmart continues to monitor its systems, customers are advised to refresh their browsers or update their apps if they still encounter issues.","Walmart's online store is back up and running after a major outage left thousands of customers unable to browse products or complete purchases.

"Mark Zuckerberg block’s iOS 18’s biggest feature for iPhones on WhatsApp, Facebook and Threads",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mark-zuckerberg-blocks-ios-18s-biggest-feature-for-iphones-on-whatsapp-facebook-and-threads/articleshow/120390396.cms,"Meta may have blocked Apple’s AI tools to promote Meta AI



Facebook parent Meta has escalated its rivalry with Apple, a report claims. The Mark Zuckerberg-led social media major is reportedly preventing users from accessing Apple Intelligence features on its popular apps, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The report claims that users are unable to access Apple’s AI features, such as Writing Tools and Genmoji, on Meta apps. The decision follows Apple’s announcement that developers could opt in or out of AI integration with iOS 18 and its subsequent rollout in October 2024. Users have reported that even basic functions like text rewriting and AI‑generated custom emoji no longer appear in Meta’s apps, despite being enabled in the app settings.According to a report by the Brazilian blog Sorcererhat Tech, the lack of access was confirmed through testing on Instagram, where these features could not be accessed even with Apple Intelligence settings enabled within the app. Apple Intelligence first became available with ios 18.1 last October, offering built‑in tools across most iPhone apps by default. The block also extends to keyboard stickers and Memoji in Instagram Stories—features that were previously accessible within the app.The move aligns with reports that Meta is steering users toward its own AI suite, Meta AI , which is integrated across its platforms. Meta AI offers similar text‑editing and image‑generation tools directly within its apps, including caption suggestions on Instagram. The company’s refusal to adopt Apple Intelligence highlights a growing divide between the two tech ecosystems over control of AI‑driven user experiences.A Wall Street Journal report from June 2024 reveals that Apple and Meta explored integrating Facebook’s AI model into iOS 18 as part of Apple Intelligence, but Apple declined the proposal over privacy concerns and instead struck a deal with OpenAI to offer optional ChatGPT responses via Siri.Given their history of clashes—from device‑interoperability demands to App Store disputes—it follows that Meta would opt to exclude Apple’s AI tools from its apps. Meta has since rolled out its suite of AI features across its platforms.Earlier this year, during an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg argued that Apple has fallen short on innovation and relies too much on the enduring success of the iPhone.""Steve Jobs invented the iPhone and now they're just kind of sitting on it 20 years later,"" Zuckerberg said, pointing to a slowdown in iPhone upgrades, as many users no longer see enough improvements in each new model to justify buying the latest device.","Facebook parent Meta is reportedly preventing users from accessing Apple Intelligence features on its popular apps.

How Nico Mueller secured the top spot

Andretti driver Nico Mueller and his race engineer Bertrand Mermine have surged to the top of the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard following a dramatic Miami Grand Prix, where post-race penalties reshuffled the final standings in Mueller’s favour. Though he originally crossed the line in 10th, Mueller was promoted to 4th, thanks to a well-timed strategy and a dash of late-race chaos. His calculated decision to split Attack Mode usage proved decisive, paying off when several drivers were hit with time penalties after the chequered flag.The Engineered to Outrun leaderboard celebrates the most dynamic driver-engineer duos in Formula E—tracking those who gain the most positions during a race, with emphasis on overtaking prowess, energy management, and overall race pace. The season concludes with an award for the top-ranked pairing.After Round 5 in Miami, the leaderboard has Maserati MSG Racing’s Stoffel Vandoorne and his race engineer Thibault Arnal on number 2. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries and race engineer Tom Bayles are in third position in the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard.The FIA Formula E Instagram account also shared the update, posting:“@nico.mueller51 overtaking his way up the rankings! With a mega drive from P18 to P4, the @andrettife driver tops the @abbgroup Engineered to Outrun leaderboard after Round 5. #MiamiEPrix #FormulaE #Motorsport #Racing.”Nico Mueller’s rise was the result of strategy combined with fortunate timing. While many drivers delayed activating Attack Mode until later in the race, Mueller opted for a more aggressive strategy—using two four-minute activations, starting with the first on Lap 11 to position himself within points range.By Lap 20, Mueller was running in 10th when a red flag was brought out following a three-car collision. After the restart, as the majority of the grid scrambled to use their remaining Attack Mode activations, Mueller’s earlier strategy gave him an edge.Despite finishing 10th on the road, he was ultimately classified 4th after multiple post-race penalties were issued. Drivers including Norman Nato, Robin Frijns, Oliver Rowland, Sam Bird, and Taylor Barnard were penalized 10 seconds each for misuse of Attack Mode, while Nick Cassidy received a five-second penalty for exceeding track limits.Also Read: Formula E Miami E-Prix 2025: Jake Hughes crashes at chicane, here’s how the multi-car collision changed the outcome.

Drake’s legal team blasts Super Bowl performance as defamation on the biggest stage

Allegations of strategic defamation and manipulation of public perception

The battle between Drake and Kendrick Lamar has taken a legal turn, as the Canadian rapper has officially filed a lawsuit against Kendrick Lamar and Universal Music over the controversial performance of ""Not Like Us"" during the Super Bowl LIX halftime show. The performance, seen by over 133 million viewers, is now the center of a legal storm, with Drake's team calling it a public and deliberate attack on his character.Drake’s legal representatives filed their complaint in a Manhattan court, arguing that the Super Bowl halftime show was used as a platform to defame and discredit him in front of the largest live audience in Super Bowl history. “The recording was made during the 2025 Super Bowl and broadcast to the largest audience for a Super Bowl halftime show in history, more than 133 million people, including millions of children and millions more who had never heard the song or any of the songs that preceded it,” Drake’s team stated.What sparked even more controversy was their claim that the entire halftime show was “orchestrated to assassinate the character of another artist,” a bold accusation suggesting Kendrick’s performance had less to do with entertainment and more with personal vendetta.Drake’s team alleges that Universal Music played a key role in enabling the performance, claiming the label utilized its financial and strategic influence to position Lamar as the face of the halftime show. They further argue that Kendrick’s omission of the word “pedophile” in the live Super Bowl rendition — a term used in the studio version of “Not Like Us” — indicates Lamar’s own awareness of the potential defamatory nature of the lyrics.The lawsuit also details real-life consequences Drake has allegedly faced, including a shooting, burglaries, and widespread online harassment following the halftime performance. His legal team insists these events have significantly damaged his brand and public image.Also Read: Tom Brady hints at betrayal and ‘willful blindness’ as Gisele Bündchen gets closer to her new baby daddy While Universal Music is seeking to have the case dismissed, citing Drake’s own role in escalating the rap beef, the legal battle only adds fuel to one of the most talked-about rivalries in modern hip-hop. As of now, neither Drake nor Kendrick Lamar has publicly commented on the lawsuit — but the silence may not last for long.","Drake has filed a lawsuit against Kendrick Lamar and Universal Music over the Super Bowl halftime show.
