"Pause, and recall your purpose, now is the time to act",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pause-and-recall-your-purpose-now-is-the-time-to-act/articleshow/119306382.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

I have always admired author Arthur Hailey. The meticulous research that has gone into each of his works never ceased to amaze me, be it Airport , Hotel , Money Changers , or Evening News . But Final Diagnosis remains my favourite.

Dr Pearson, an old doctor, who once helmed a research centre and Hospital, imparts wisdom to his young successor, Coleman, on the fleeting nature of time:

“You’ll sit on that chair and the phone will ring, and it’ll be the administrator—talking about budgets. Next minute, one of the lab staff will want to quit.” The old man smiled. That’s the way a day can go, and the next. Until you find a year has slipped by, and another. You will not read books, you will delegate research work to junior doctors.

And one day, you’ll realize that everything you once knew is outdated. If you want to avoid that, lock yourself in a room. Stay ahead.

I don’t remember whether Dr Coleman took Dr Pearson’s advice in the novel, but those words of Hailey stayed with me.

That’s how time passes us—like water cupped in our palms.

Our daily routines must go on, endless chores will demand our attention. Women, especially, bear this weight tenfold: ""My nails need trimming, I can't recall my last salon visit, my hospital check-up is overdue. It’s been a year since I had an uninterrupted conversation with my sister.”

Life is a constant battle between the vital few and the trivial many. The external world demands attention, but our internal calling whispers persistently. We work tirelessly, filling our days with ceaseless activity. But if we pause and ask whether we have moved closer to our dreams, the answer is often silent regret.

This paradox haunts employees during performance evaluations. ""I’ve been working non-stop,"" they say, only to hear, ""But the goals set at the beginning of the year remain unfulfilled."" Ironically, their managers, and their managers’ managers, all wonder the same—where did the time go?

Time management experts constantly remind us to carve out ‘sacred time’. Step away from the routine, and focus on what truly matters – at least 25% of our time has to be allotted for that. If we continue to say, “One day, when things settle, I will pursue my dream,” that day may never arrive. The time to act is now.

In the Mahabharata , the Pandavas lived an incognito year, shedding their royal identities in Virata Parva . Yudhishthira became a dice companion to the king, Draupadi a royal maid, Bhima a palace cook, Arjuna a transgender dance teacher, Nakula a horse trainer, and Sahadeva an astrologer. That year of reinvention deepened their wisdom, strengthening them for what lay ahead. When they left behind their identities and routine, they were able to connect with their inner selves more deeply.

Many renowned artists, thinkers, and scientists took time away from the everyday grind to devote themselves to their passion. Beethoven withdrew from social life to compose some of his greatest symphonies. Writers like Thoreau retreated into solitude to pen works that would later inspire generations.

Thiruvalluvar’s wisdom echoes through time:

Eydarkku Ariyadhu iyaindakkaal Annilaye

Seydarkku Ariya Seyal.

Hesitate not to prioritise the time which is rare,

And achieve tasks otherwise hard.

Are our days spent merely ticking off tasks on an endless list or in shaping something when looked back upon, brings fulfilment rather than regret?

What Should You Do If You Receive an Unpaid Toll Scam Text

If you get a suspicious toll-related text, take these steps:

How You Can Protect Yourself from Toll Scam Messages

Stay ahead of scammers with these precautions:

There has been a barrage of unsolicited text messages flooding Americans’ phones in recent months, falsely claiming they owe unpaid tolls and E-ZPass bills. Experts speaking to NBC News reveal this is the work of a sophisticated online syndicate of Chinese-speaking scammers . These criminals sell cybercrime kits on Telegram, designed to steal credit card details and personal information. The scam typically involves a text stating the recipient missed a toll payment, owes a small fee that could increase if unpaid, and includes a link to a fraudulent payment site. Authorities in states like New York, Virginia, Maryland, and Indiana have issued warnings, while the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center has logged over 60,000 reports of this scam. Despite the scale, U.S. officials have not pinpointed the source, with some, like Jennifer Givner of the New York State Thruway Authority, admitting they’re unsure who’s behind it, only that it’s persistent and evolving.Smishing, short for SMS phishing, uses fake text messages to trick people into believing they owe toll fees. These texts often link to counterfeit payment portals that appear legitimate. Clicking the link and entering personal details can lead to financial loss, malware installation, or identity theft. The danger lies in their sophistication—scammers replicate official toll agency branding, use urgent wording like ""Pay now or face penalties,"" and even spoof phone numbers to seem authentic.The toll scam has exploded, with federal agencies like the FTC and FBI raising alarms. Reports of these fraudulent messages have spiked since early 2024. The FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) notes that the 60,000+ complaints likely underrepresent the issue, as many victims don’t report small losses or fail to recognize the scam. Cybersecurity experts suggest the true number of affected people could be far higher.* Digital Tolling Systems Dominate: Cash toll booths are fading, and digital payments are now the norm in many states.* Trust in Mobile Transactions: People increasingly manage finances via phones, making them more receptive to urgent toll alerts.* Refined Scammer Tactics: Organized crime groups send mass messages from international numbers, complicating efforts to trace them.* Using Real Agency Names: They reference familiar brands like E-ZPass or SunPass.* Crafting Near-Identical URLs: Bogus sites mimic official ones, often with subtle differences like an extra letter.* Creating Urgency: Phrases like ""Final Notice!"" or ""Act now to avoid fines"" pressure victims into quick action.* Avoid Clicking Links: This prevents malware or data theft.* Verify Directly: Visit your toll agency’s official website to check your account.* Report It: Send the text to 7726 (SPAM) and report it at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.* Block the Sender: Stop further messages by blocking the number.Enable Spam Filters: Use your phone’s built-in tools to block suspicious texts.","Smishing, short for SMS phishing, uses fake text messages to trick people into believing they owe toll fees.

A New Jersey man is suing United Airlines, alleging that a pilot forcibly removed him from an aeroplane bathroom mid-flight while his pants were still down before having him arrested.The passenger, 20-year-old Yisroel Liebb , says he was flying from Mexico to Texas when he experienced constipation and spent an extended period in the restroom. According to his lawsuit, his seatmate, Jacob Sebbag, grew concerned and alerted the flight crew when Liebb had been inside for about 20 minutes.When a flight attendant knocked, Liebb reportedly assured them he would be out soon. However, 10 minutes later, the pilot allegedly demanded he exit immediately.The lawsuit claims that, in a fit of anger, the pilot broke down the bathroom door and yanked Liebb out while his pants were still down, exposing him to fellow passengers. As he scrambled to pull up his pants, the pilot allegedly threatened to have both him and his seatmate arrested, making a remark about how ""Jews act,"" the lawsuit states.Upon landing, the pair were met by five US customs and border protection agents, who detained them inside the terminal. Liebb claims the handcuffs were so tight that he cried out in pain, while he and Sebbag missed their connecting flight to New York due to the ordeal.Though they were released without charges, the two had to pay for hotel and meal expenses before they could fly home the next day, according to the complaint.Liebb alleges he suffered injuries to his head and legs when he was forcefully removed from the bathroom, while both men claim they experienced severe wrist pain from the handcuffs.The lawsuit, which also names homeland security, the transportation security administration, and customs and border protection, seeks damages to be determined at trial, plus attorneys' fees.United Airlines declined to comment on the lawsuit.","Yisroel Liebb, 20, says he was flying from Mexico to Texas when he experienced constipation and spent an extended period in the restroom.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What the FBI said about the scam



“The texts claim the recipient owes money for unpaid tolls and contain almost identical language. The ‘outstanding toll amount’ is similar. However, the link provided within the text is created to impersonate the state’s toll service name, and phone numbers appear to change between states.”

Chinese phishers are reportedly targeting US residents with text messages that appear to be from US toll road operators. These ""smishing"" texts are said to be targeting iPhone and Android users across America with fake toll bills . The FBI has advised users to delete these texts immediately. One cyber expert has also described the scale of this issue as ""astronomical."" According to a report by the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), “residents of the US are being bombarded with text messages from Chinese phishers, purporting to come from US toll road operators , including the multi-state E-ZPass.” These kits also send package delivery and other fake messages. This is described as an infrastructural attack on phones. In December 2024, the FBI also advised Americans to stop sending texts due to Chinese hackers.In a statement to Forbes, the FBI said:Attackers are reportedly registering tens of thousands of domains to impersonate state and city toll agencies, using an advanced phishing kit from China to send nearly identical scam texts.These messages, often sent to random phone numbers regardless of toll usage, usually include links with Chinese top-level domains like .TOP, .CYOU, and .XIN—the .TOP domain in particular has a history of abuse and remains under ICANN investigation.Despite available anti-spam measures on SMS and RCS protocols, scammers continually change tactics, making prevention difficult. Users are urged to report these scams to help improve global blocking mechanisms and to verify toll charges only through official sources while taking precautions such as changing passwords if they click on any suspicious links.","Chinese phishers are reportedly targeting US residents with text messages that appear to be from US toll road operators.

Linda McMahon's WWE-style governance in politics



Wrestling tactics in Washington

An entirely different story around Linda McMahon has come up again, and this time, it is all about what stands her as an important addition to the Trump Cabinet and the dear department of many, currently being dismantled by the U.S. Department of Education . Apart from aggressive leadership that saw WWE cede its billion-dollar status, it has no impact on the government's approach. And by the way, where else will her decision-making style on earlier leading WWE keep afloat the entertainment industry than shaping national educational policy today?The small titles for which McMahon shall draw may include the occasional rude awakening to a huge list of controversies, branding, and, not least of all, dwindling profitability. Now she is operating out of the appointment that will witness the closure of the Education Department. Truly, it's just one step further into the Trump administration's agenda toward less federal scrutiny. As she once helped WWE adapt to an ever-changing industry, she will now transfer that experience into reforming governance in education.Her years spent in WWE have been classified, whether moving to PG-era transitions or signing billion-dollar media deals, as one calculated risk after another. And that same mindset, it is evident, will apply here, as though she were initiating the dissolution of a major federal agency. This is not just trimming away the fat of bureaucracy; it represents an alteration in the very way education policy will treat itself going forward like WWE redefined sports entertainment.This will make Sleek McMahon a force to reckon with-in politics. She is ready for high-stakes dealings that mostly involve wrestling, through which she managed huge contracts on television or championed popular reforms. She knows how to put herself in control of a situation. And as she pushes ahead with the policy change, her profile continues to grow; she proves that her leadership does not confine into wrestling.Also Read: Vince McMahon and Linda McMahon Age Difference: Married Life Details You Need to Know About the McMahons Change is the one constant McMahon knows from WWE's boardrooms to the intricacies of government.

Jameis Winston joins the New York Giants: What it means for the Quarterback room



What Winston brings to the Giants



What this means for Aaron Rodgers and the Giants



The New York Giants have made a significant move at the quarterback position, though it may not be the one many anticipated. The team has secured the services of veteran quarterback Jameis Winston on a two-year deal worth $8 million, as reported by NFL Media. Winston himself confirmed the signing on social media, signaling a fresh chapter in his career with Big Blue. However, the signing raises more questions than answers, particularly regarding the Giants' long-term plans at quarterback and how this impacts their potential pursuit of Aaron Rodgers.While adding Winston provides the Giants with much-needed experience under center, it does not necessarily take them out of the running for other quarterbacks. NFL Media has indicated that New York remains open to acquiring additional talent, whether through free agency—where Rodgers is still available—or via the upcoming NFL Draft, where Shedeur Sanders is a strong candidate for the No. 3 overall pick.If the Giants do decide to draft a quarterback, Winston could serve as a transitional figure, helping to mentor a rookie and providing a stabilizing presence as they adjust to the NFL. This signing also reflects the Giants' ongoing search for a veteran signal-caller after missing out on other targets, such as Matthew Stafford, who opted to stay with the Los Angeles Rams.Despite Winston’s experience, his contract suggests that he is not necessarily being viewed as the long-term solution. At $8 million over two years, the financial commitment is relatively modest, positioning him more as a bridge quarterback rather than the definitive starter. Before this signing, Tommy DeVito was the only quarterback on the Giants’ roster, highlighting the team’s urgent need for additional depth at the position.Winston, 31, brings a wealth of experience to the Giants' locker room. Having entered the league as the No. 1 overall pick in 2015 with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he has started 87 regular-season games throughout his career. His career statistics include 24,225 passing yards, 154 touchdowns, and 111 interceptions, with an 86.4 passer rating. Last season, Winston made seven starts for the Cleveland Browns, where he completed 61.1% of his passes for 2,121 yards, throwing 13 touchdowns against 12 interceptions.His experience as a starter makes him a viable short-term option for the Giants, particularly if they draft a young quarterback. While he may not possess the same ceiling as elite quarterbacks, his presence ensures the team has a competent signal-caller who can step in and lead the offense if needed.The timing of Winston’s signing is particularly interesting, as it coincided with Aaron Rodgers’ visit with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Giants have long been rumored as a potential destination for Rodgers, and some speculated that bringing in Winston might signal a shift away from those plans. However, according to Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer, Winston’s signing does not affect the Giants' pursuit of Rodgers. ""Winston is nothing more than a veteran for the QB room,"" Breer reported, emphasizing that the team’s interest in Rodgers remains unchanged.Rodgers, who remains the highest-profile quarterback on the free-agent market, left his visit with the Steelers without a deal. That leaves open the possibility that New York could still make a push for him. If the Giants were to sign Rodgers, it would likely alter their draft strategy, making it less urgent to select a quarterback early.Alternatively, if the Giants opt not to sign Rodgers, Winston could hold the starting job temporarily while a rookie quarterback develops. This approach aligns with how other teams have managed young signal-callers, easing them into the starting role rather than throwing them into the fire immediately.The signing of Jameis Winston provides the New York Giants with a veteran presence at quarterback, but it does not offer a definitive answer to the team’s long-term plans. While Winston is a capable starter with extensive experience, his arrival does not rule out the possibility of adding another quarterback, either through free agency or the draft.Also Read: ""Because I caught it early, we were able to treat it”: Erin Andrews encourages regular doctor visits after cervical cancer battle With Rodgers still available and the Giants holding the No. 3 pick in the upcoming draft, the quarterback landscape in New York remains fluid. Whether Winston ultimately becomes the starter or serves as a mentor for a young quarterback, his presence ensures that the Giants are better prepared at the position heading into the 2025 season. However, until Rodgers makes a decision or the Giants finalize their draft-day plans, the question remains: who will be leading the team under center when the season kicks off?","The New York Giants have signed veteran quarterback Jameis Winston on a two-year deal worth $8 million.

Rob Gronkowski shares his perspective on Tom Brady’s growth and determination in the commentary booth

How Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski are shaping the future of NFL coverage and game analysis

Stepping into the broadcast booth after a record-breaking playing career is a challenge few athletes have successfully conquered, but Tom Brady is proving he’s up to the task. With a staggering $375 million contract from Fox Sports, Brady’s new role as the network’s lead color commentator is one of the most high-profile transitions in sports media history.Unlike his days on the field, where he had complete control of the game, broadcasting demands a different skill set—quick analysis, engaging storytelling, and effortless on-air chemistry. While his deep football knowledge is undeniable, translating that expertise into captivating commentary for millions of viewers is a craft that takes time to master. Early broadcasts have shown his steady improvement, with each game serving as another opportunity for him to refine his approach and deliver insightful breakdowns.One of the most vocal supporters of Brady’s journey into broadcasting has been his former teammate and longtime friend, Rob Gronkowski. “The challenges are significant, but Brady’s improvements have been noticeable since his initial games in the booth,” Gronkowski remarked, recognizing the steady evolution of Brady’s on-air performance.Gronkowski, who has also made his own move into sports media as a studio analyst, understands the steep learning curve that comes with broadcasting. Watching Brady tackle this new challenge with the same dedication that made him a football icon is no surprise to those who know him best. “The evolution in his commentary reflects a natural progression,” Gronkowski added, emphasizing that Brady’s commitment to excellence extends beyond the football field.The legendary duo of Brady and Gronkowski once dominated the NFL, securing championships and setting records together. Now, their influence continues in a different arena—sports broadcasting—where they are helping to redefine how fans experience the game.Brady’s early work in the booth suggests that his relentless pursuit of perfection will drive him to become one of the premier voices in football analysis. As he continues to refine his delivery, sharpen his insights, and bring more personality to his broadcasts, he is poised to elevate the standard of NFL commentary.Also Read: Tom Brady embraces single life and casual dating while ex-wife Gisele Bündchen welcomed new baby His broadcasting career is still in its infancy, but given his track record of mastering every challenge he takes on, there is little doubt that Tom Brady will soon be as dominant behind the microphone as he was on the field.","Rob Gronkowski shares his perspective on Tom Brady’s growth and determination in the commentary booth. “The evolution in his commentary reflects a natural progression,” Gronkowski said.
