The body of a postgraduate trainee doctor was discovered in the seminar hall of the state-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata in the early hours of August 9. The circumstances surrounding her death have since ignited a nationwide uproar.The series of phone calls that gradually informed her parents of the incident paint a haunting picture of how the rape-murder of the young medic was initially portrayed as a suicide.In the first call, the anxious voice on the other end was insistent yet vague.Who is speaking?I am calling from RG Kar hospital.What has happened?She is unwell. Can you come immediately?But why, what has happened?She is unwell. She has been admitted? Can you come immediately?But what has happened, at least tell us?That doctor will say. I was given your number and asked to inform the family.But please tell us what has happened.Patient is unwell, please come as soon as possible. Rest doctor will inform you.Does she have a fever?You all just come soon, as soon as possible.Is her condition not good?The condition is bad, please come as soon as possible.The lack of clarity and urgency in the initial call from the caller identifying herself as the assistant superintendent of the hospital mirrored the grim reality that awaited her family.The second call, coming from a visibly stressed caller, brought a shift in the gravity of the situation.But please tell me what has happened?Her condition is very bad. Please come as soon as possible.But what has happened?That the doctor will tell, please come soon.Who are you?I am assistant superitendant, I am not a doctor.Is there no doctor there?We have brought your daughter to the Emergency. You come and contact us.But what happened to her? She was on duty.You just come quickly, as soon as possible.The second call only compounded the family's growing horror, with no real answers to the burning questions that plagued them.The final call was the most harrowing of all. The reality of their worst fears was confirmed in a heartbreaking message.I was telling you earlier. The matter is that your daughter has died by suicide. She is dead. Police are here, we are all here, please come as soon as possible.YesThe revelation of the young doctor's death by alleged ‘suicide’ came as a brutal shock to her family, who had been desperately seeking information about her. The ambiguity and coldness of the communication only deepened their anguish. It was later found out that the case being dismissed as ‘suicide’ was actually a case of rape and murder as the investigation revealed.The case, initially handled by the Kolkata Police, has been transferred to the CBI. Civic volunteer Sanjoy Roy has been arrested, and both the former principal of RG Kar Medical College, Sandip Ghosh, and Roy have undergone polygraph tests as part of the ongoing investigation.The tragic death has spurred unprecedented protests across the nation. As the longest-running doctors' protest since the 1980s rocked the nation, the outcry against the alleged rape-murder has brought to light severe issues within the healthcare system.",The body of a postgraduate trainee doctor was discovered in the seminar hall of the state-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata.

It allows users to blur pictures except for specific matches and offers the option of having chaperones oversee meetings.Since its launch in 2015 in Britain, Muzz has attracted over 1.5 million users in Pakistan, making it the app's second-largest market after Morocco.The Lahore event provided a safe space for attendees like Aimen, 31, to step out of the confines of online interactions. “I used the app for two weeks, but when I saw an ad for this event, I thought, why not meet people in person?” she said.Moaz, 27, who has been using Muzz for a year, expressed hope that the event might help him find a life partner.However, he pointed out that many girls on the app expect parental involvement from the start, which he found challenging. ""That is not possible,"" he said, emphasising the importance of getting to know someone before involving families.In addition to Muzz, other events like Annie's matchmaking party in Lahore are also challenging traditional matchmaking norms .Noor ul Ain Choudhary, the 30-year-old organiser, faced criticism online for allegedly promoting a ""hookup culture."" She defended her event, explaining that it was intended to provide a safe space for singles to meet and connect.","Muzz, a UK-based matrimonial app, hosted an in-person event in Lahore.

Let’s keep moving forward with love and positivity! Welcome to the family"".Reflecting on her past struggles, Slaton said, “I was so focused on losing weight, I lost myself. I lost who I was, and I turned to alcohol instead of food. At the same time, I was still eating. I was doing both — damage in two different ways. It would be so easy to fall back into bad habits and gain all the weight back. Then, what was this all for? Wasted time. Wasted money. Wasted effort. Waste.”Tammy pointed out that her transformation was not merely due to diet but a comprehensive “lifestyle change”.

Ranging from 300 to 900, a higher score indicates a stronger likelihood of loan approval. Banks and financial institutions use this score to assess the risk associated with lending money.1. Go to the official CIBIL website and click on 'Personal CIBIL score,' then 'Get Your Free CIBIL score.' Follow the link provided and fill in all the required details.2. If you don’t have a PAN Card, you can use an alternative identification such as Passport, Voter ID, Driver’s License, or Ration Card. Enter the number of the chosen ID.3.

Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

Why these hackings are dangerous

The Russian state-sponsored APT29 hacking group has been observed using the same iOS and Chrome on Android exploits created by commercial spyware vendors like NSO Group and Intellexa in a series of cyberattacks between November 2023 and July 2024.“The campaigns first delivered an iOS WebKit exploit affecting iOS versions older than 16.6.1 and then later, a Chrome exploit chain against Android users running versions from m121 to m123,” said Google 's Threat Analysis Group (TAG).Google's TAG said the n-day flaws have already been patched but remain effective on devices that have not been updated.Google says that APT29, also known as “Midnight Blizzard”, targeted multiple websites of the Mongolian government and employed “watering hole” tactics.“We assess with moderate confidence the campaigns are linked to the Russian government-backed actor APT29. In each iteration of the watering hole campaigns, the attackers used exploits that were identical or strikingly similar to exploits previously used by commercial surveillance vendors (CSVs) Intellexa and NSO Group,” it said.A watering hole is a type of cyberattack where a legitimate site is compromised with malicious code designed to deliver payloads to visitors that meet specific criteria.Google's threat analysts note that APT29 has a long history of exploiting zero-day and n-day vulnerabilities. The hackers leveraged an iOS WebKit flaw for stealing browser cookies from iPhone users running iOS 16.6.1 and older.TAG reports that this exploit was exactly the same as the one Intellexa used in September 2023, leveraging CVE-2023-41993 as a zero-day vulnerability at the time.In a similar way, APT29 leveraged exploits on Google Chrome to attack Android users visiting compromised websites. The purpose was to steal cookies, passwords, and other sensitive data stored on the victims' Chrome browser.Since the patch for these exploits are available, iPhone and Android users are advised to install updates as soon as they can to protect their privacy.",Russian state-sponsored APT29 has been observed using the same iOS and Chrome on Android exploits created by commercial spyware vendors like NSO Group and Intellexa in a series of cyberattacks.

No surprises, as many would say. The writing has been there on the wall for sometime now. Google acquired Fitbit in 2021, since then there were speculations about the future of the brand. While since 2021, Google launched three Pixel series smartwatches, including the Pixel Watch 3 at the recent 'Made for Google' event, there have been two Fitbit smartwatches -- Versa 4 and Sense 2.The Fitbit Versa 4 and Sense 2 were launched just months before Google’s first Pixel Watch.Google has now confirmed that Fitbit as a brand will no longer be making new smartwatches and that the Pixel Watch series will be taking over that form factor going forward. Speaking to Engadget, Google’s director of product management for Pixel wearables, Sandeep Waraich, said, “Pixel Watch is our smartwatch part of the portfolio”. Waraich said the same in response to a question about the future of the Fitbit-branded smartwatches, adding that Pixel Watch is “our next iteration of smartwatch for Fitbit.”But while you may not get Fitbit smartwatches, Fitbit brand per se is not being killed. Google will continue to make Fitbit fitness bands . Fitbit-branded products will focus on trackers that are “more minimalistic” with long battery life, said Waraich.As to what happens to Fitbit smartwatch customers . Google said, ""We are very committed to Fitbit, and even more importantly to the customers that use and depend on those products and technology. It's also worth noting that many of the health and fitness features we launched in Pixel Watch 3 were because of Fitbit's innovation and ground-breaking fitness advancements. In addition, we just launched Fitbit Ace LTE , and you’ll continue to see new products and innovation from Fitbit.""This means that Google will continue to provide software updates, and even new features to both devices.As for Pixel Watch fans, Google has launched Pixel Watch 3 in India, starting at RS 39,99. Pixel Watch 3 will go on sale in the country in September.","Google acquired Fitbit in 2021, since then there were speculations about the future of the brand.

"Cristiano Ronaldo: 'All the goals that I score, they have video': Cristiano Ronaldo takes a sly dig at football legends",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/all-the-goals-that-i-score-they-have-video-cristiano-ronaldo-takes-a-sly-dig-at-football-legends/articleshow/112883513.cms,"Top Picks For You Cristiano Ronaldo scores stunning free-kick for 899th career goal in Al-Nassr victory - Watch

My thoughts on my 2023/24 season and the truth about my future. Talk with my friend Rio (PART 1)

Cristiano Ronaldo , 39, has announced his goal to reach 1,000 career goals , having already scored a remarkable 899. Ronaldo shared this new ambition during a YouTube interview with his former teammate, Rio Ferdinand . His declaration highlights his ongoing determination to surpass expectations and continue delivering on the field despite his age.""Soon I will do 900, and after that, I will reach 1,000 goals,"" Ronaldo revealed, demonstrating his unwavering confidence and competitive spirit.Ferdinand humorously asked Ronaldo about his future in football, ""How old are you gonna be then when you're still playing?"" Ronaldo’s response indicated his enduring passion and drive to push boundaries in the sport.Ronaldo took a light-hearted jab at legendary players like Pele by noting that all his goals have video proof, ensuring their legitimacy. Pele is often recognized by FIFA for scoring 1,281 goals, but many of these goals were scored in unofficial friendly matches, which have faced scrutiny.""For me, it's the best mark that I can have in football, to reach first 900 goals. After, my challenge is 1,000 goals,"" Ronaldo said. He added with a smile, ""With one difference, all the goals that I score, they have video. So I can prove that it’s [real].""In response, Ferdinand laughed and said, ""You’re talking about [Alfredo] Di Stefano, you’re talking about Pele, Eusebio .""WATCH:Ronaldo, showing his respect for other football legends, clarified, ""Listen, I respect all of them. My goals, [are] all goals."" He continued with a grin, ""And if you want more goals, I can bring [footage] from training too. So no problem, all the goals on video! And I will prove to the people after [that I scored them]. [If] they prefer this player, I don’t care about that.""As Ronaldo nears the 900-goal milestone, his aim to achieve 1,000 career goals is a testament to his relentless pursuit of excellence. While it remains to be seen if he will reach this extraordinary milestone, Ronaldo's impact on football and his status as one of the sport's greatest figures remain unquestionable.","Cristiano Ronaldo has announced his goal to reach 1,000 career goals.

"US Open tennis players take naps before matches, especially late ones",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/us-open/us-open-tennis-players-take-naps-before-matches-especially-late-ones/articleshow/112901801.cms,"NEW DELHI: Numerous tennis athletes participating in the US Open have highlighted the significance of napping, particularly before evening matches, as a beneficial strategy for enhancing performance.Players find opportunities to rest in various locations, including hotels and a specially designated “Player Quiet Room” located near the locker rooms, to gain the advantages of additional sleep during the tournament's duration.Tatjana Maria , a 37-year-old player from Germany and a mother of two, emphasized the necessity of resting in the afternoon to prepare for evening matches, a sentiment echoed by many athletes whose games can start as late as 11 p.m.“In the evening, I get tired, like everybody else, so that's why I have to take a nap,” said Maria. “I have to rest pretty much the whole afternoon to be ready for the evening.”The consensus among players from diverse backgrounds and rankings is clear: skipping rest could lead to suboptimal performance.Zhang Zhizhen, a 27-year-old Olympic silver medalist from China, mentioned his routine of taking short naps to combat fatigue, indicating a common practice among players to incorporate sleep into their preparation regimen.“If I feel tired, I want to sleep, so I go to sleep. Maybe if I have the first match at 11 a.m., I don’t have enough time. But any other match, I probably will take a nap for 10 or 15 minutes,” noted Zhang. “Sometimes in the afternoon, I will sleep for one or two hours.""However, not all players are able to embrace this approach. Sofia Kenin, the 2020 Australian Open champion, and Tommy Paul, an American player, shared their difficulties in relaxing enough to nap before matches due to adrenaline and nerves.Other players, like Clara Tauson and Donna Vekic, express concerns about napping disrupting their mood or alertness. “If I nap, I just wake up in a bad mood,” said Vekic.In contrast, Bianca Andreescu, the 2019 US Open champion from Canada, has found a unique method involving espresso to enhance the effectiveness of her naps.Casper Ruud, a notable player from Norway, also values the role of napping in his pre-match routine, especially when playing later in the day. The US Open has accommodated players' need for rest by setting up a quiet room equipped with lounge chairs, beds, and chaise lounges, complemented by a water feature for relaxation.Denis Shapovalov and Leylah Fernandez, both young talents, have adapted to sleeping in unconventional locations to ensure they get the rest they need.“I’ve done some weird spots. I’ve been in locker rooms before where there’s not really a couch and you kind of have to make a couch,” said Shapovalov, a 25-year-old Canadian who reached Wimbledon 's semifinals in 2021. “I've done it at (tournament) restaurants. I've done it on the ground at a gym. You (nap) wherever you find space.”Even during matches, as demonstrated by Nick Kyrgios in a 2015 match against Andy Murray , finding moments to rest, albeit briefly, can be part of a player's strategy to stay refreshed.","Tennis players have highlighted the significance of napping, particularly before evening matches.

Ace shuttler Lakshya Sen heads to Austria for physical assessment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/badminton/ace-shuttler-lakshya-sen-heads-to-austria-for-physical-assessment/articleshow/112781470.cms,"Lakshya Sen , India's 22-year-old badminton star from the recently concluded Paris Olympics, left for Austria on Sunday in order to get assessed and optimize his physical condition for the upcoming BWF tournaments.Sen, who narrowly missed securing an Olympic medal at the Olympics by finishing fourth, is determined to enhance his performance.To achieve this, he will undergo a comprehensive assessment at the Red Bull Athlete Performance Centre located in Salzburg.The state-of-the-art facility will conduct a series of tests to provide Sen with a thorough evaluation of his body, enabling him to fine-tune his fitness regimen and elevate his game to new heights.""Lakshya is going to Austria to do some physical assessment. There is a good sports institute there, where he wants to do some physical exercise. He left today and will be back after a week,"" coach Vimal Kumar told PTI.Lakshya's trainer Gaurav, along with 15-year-old junior shuttler Nischal Chand as training partner, are accompanying Sen to keep him in shape during the week.""The tests will focus basically on specific strength aspects. Many of the elite athletes go and get themselves tested there. We had consulted Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala for all his niggles and injuries.""Right now he is fine; but before he really starts going full-fledged, it is important for him to get the right physical training, and unless the strength and conditioning program is really spot on, he can get injuries. So we have to find the right things to do.""Lakshya is expected to participate in the upcoming Hong Kong Super 500 and China Open Super 1000 tournaments, which are scheduled to take place in late September of this year.According to Vimal, the nature of Lakshya's playing style demands him to continuously work on improving his overall fitness.""He needs to definitely get better on fitness aspects, especially the speed, endurance and other things he needs to work on because the game he plays, it's very fast-paced. He has to defend a lot and then he converts the defence into offense,"" said Vimal.""When he's playing with the wind, he needs to keep putting the shuttle down, come into the net, tumble at the net, so up and down...those sort of things. It takes away a lot of your energy. So he needs to get super fit or develop the ability to control the drift.""",Lakshya Sen will undergo a comprehensive assessment at the Red Bull Athlete Performance Centre located in Salzburg.
