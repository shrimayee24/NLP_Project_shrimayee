Mark Cuban on biggest barrier for students





American billionaire and Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban said that students these days use artificial intelligence (AI) excessively to ask the “right questions”. However, he said that students should not rely much on AI. Instead, they must use AI to enhance their own critical-thinking skills, rather than replace them. “They use strong inputs and apply critical thinking to evaluate results,” he said adding “AI helps students think bigger, but it doesn’t make decisions”.In an interview with CNBC’s Make It last year, Cuban said that tomorrow’s leaders might be today’s AI-obsessed kids. “Students who use AI will produce better, more creative work and gain a collaborative relationship with technology that’s needed in the future workplace,” he said adding: “Students who use AI will be best equipped to lead.”During the interview, Mark Cuban said that “Access is the biggest barrier” to students being taught how to best use AI tools effectively and ethically at school. According to Samsung’s new Solve for Tomorrow 2025 AI Readiness Study, 80% of US teachers believe that learning AI skills is important for students’ success in the future. However, research shows that educators have expressed concern over misuse of AI tools to cheat, or that the information obtained from AI models will include errors that spread misinformation.But Cuban has asserted that students need to learn to use AI tools properly and productively. He has previously likened the current AI boom to past technological revolutions, particularly the rise of computers and the internet. “Spend as much time as possible familiarizing yourself with the latest AI tools and models, so you can impress future employers with your up-to-date prompt engineering and model customization skills,” an advice that he often gives to students, per a CNBC report.Speaking on an episode of the “TBPN” podcast in 2025, Mark Cuban said”“Every single company needs that. There is nothing intuitive for a company to integrate AI, and that’s what people don’t understand. That is going to be jobs left and right.”","Mark Cuban said that students these days use artificial intelligence (AI) excessively to ask the “right questions” He said that they must use AI to enhance their own critical-thinking skills, rather than replace them. “AI helps students think bigger, but it doesn’t make decisions”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126352688,imgsize-29300,width-400,resizemode-4/billionaire-mark-cuban-has-a-success-tip-for-students-ai-will-help-students-think-bigger-but-it-doesn39t-.jpg"

Nvidia’s Alpamayo to debut with Mercedes CLA





At the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Nvidia launched Alpamayo – an open source AI model for autonomous vehicles. Announcing the new AI model, CEO Jensen Huang said that it is the world’s first thinking, reasoning autonomous vehicle AI. He further revealed that the Alpamayo is launching on US roads later this year, starting with the Mercedes CLA. “Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments, and explain their driving decisions,” he further added. Responding to one such posts about the autonomous vehicle AI, Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote:“Well that’s just exactly what Tesla is doing 😂 What they will find is that it’s easy to get to 99% and then super hard to solve the long tail of the distribution.”Alpamayo introduces Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models designed for self-driving systems. The models will allow autonomous vehicles to understand visual inputs, assess driving situations and decide on driving actions. The platform also includes large reasoning models, simulation tools to test rare or unusual driving situations, and open datasets that can be used for training and validation.Talking about Alpamayo, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement that “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here – when machines begin to understand, reason, and act in the real world”.“It's trained end-to-end. Literally from camera in to actuation out; It reasons what action it is about to take, the reason by which it came about that action, and the trajectory”, he added.""With a 10-billion-parameter architecture, Alpamayo 1 uses video input to generate trajectories alongside reasoning traces, showing the logic behind each decision. Developers can adapt Alpamayo 1 into smaller runtime models for vehicle development, or use it as a foundation for AV development tools such as reasoning-based evaluators and auto-labeling systems. Alpamayo 1 provides open model weights and open-source inferencing scripts. Future models in the family will feature larger parameter counts, more detailed reasoning capabilities, more input and output flexibility, and options for commercial usage,"" he continued.As mentioned above, Nvidia has partnered with Mercedes to bring its autonomous vehicle AI. Announcing the partnership, the chip maker said “NVIDIA is enabling a new era of AI-defined driving, bringing its NVIDIA DRIVE AV software with enhanced level 2 point-to-point driver assistance capabilities to U.S. roads, expected by end of this year — starting with Mercedes-Benz, a long-standing partner in advancing safe, intelligent mobility. ”“The all-new Mercedes-Benz CLA — the brand’s first vehicle featuring the MB.OS platform — introduces advanced driver-assistance features powered by NVIDIA’s full-stack DRIVE AV software, AI infrastructure and accelerated compute.This design may enable over-the-air updates of future upgrades and new features, including planned enhancements to MB.DRIVE ASSIST PRO, which may be available ex-factory and through the Mercedes-Benz store.”","Nvidia’s Alpamayo to debut with Mercedes CLA later this year.

EXPOSED: Mark Zuckerberg Embarrassed on Hot Mic Admitting Total Confusion During Trump Dinner





Ever since Mark Zuckerberg announced the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs in first half of 2025, Meta CEO has been on an AI hiring blitz. A Twitter user who goes by the moniker @HinataMotivates, said to be a tech-motivation account, shared a podcast clip (going back to 2022) where Zuckerberg talks about Meta hiring rule and his advice for college students. Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone and the one that he says is also an important tip for any college student. In an episode of the “Lex Fridman Podcast,” hosted by MIT computer scientist Lex Fridman, Zuckerberg said that most people know Facebook ’s dorm-room origin story and that many have learned the wrong lesson from it. He said that his initial ability to launch Facebook wasn’t because he dropped out of college. According to Zuckerberg, it was due to the personal connections he made while he was still in school.Who you spend time with in college, Zuckerberg said, is “the most important decision” any student can make in college. He advised college students that choosing their social circle is the most pivotal decision, as people tend to emulate those around them. “You become the people you surround yourself with,” he said in the podcast.“I think probably people are too, in general, objective focused, and maybe not focused enough on the connections and the people who they’re basically building relationships [with]. ” Meta CEO Zuckerberg is said to have met his Facebook co-founders ⁠— Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes and Andrew McCollum ⁠— while the five were students at Harvard University.While the group split up in a not-so-happy manner, Zuckerberg said on the podcast that he tries to prioritize relationships over objectives. This applies especially to hiring. Zuckerberg said that he extends the idea to his Meta hiring philosophy: He only employs candidates he did hypothetically work for, underscoring reciprocity and alignment in professional networks. When evaluating a job candidate, he imagines what it would be like to work for that person. “I will only hire someone to work for me if I can see myself working for them,” he said.Mark Zuckerberg said that the strategy creates a work environment that’s both more cohesive and more productive: If you work with people who share your values on a human level, you’ll be more likely to smoothly achieve your work goals together. It’s all about finding personal compatibility, he said, not unlike “choosing friends or a partner.”","Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone.

Zoho senior engineer ships three-week projects in one day





Zoho founder and Chief Scientist Sridhar Vembu has revealed that one of his engineers recently built a sophisticated assembly and machine code security tool alone in just one month—work that would typically require a team of three to four developers an entire year. The breakthrough, Vembu disclosed on X, came after the engineer discovered Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 model, which he called a ""game changer"" that finally convinced him AI-generated code was worth using.""I did not know he was building it. I was blown away by the depth and breadth of the tool,"" Vembu wrote, describing how the experienced developer from his R&D team created the project in his spare time. The Zoho founder characterized the moment as the arrival of ""powerful machine looms for software development,"" comparing the disruption to how mechanized weaving once challenged traditional handloom workers.The productivity gains extend across Zoho's engineering organization. Vembu shared that one of the company's most productive engineers—a veteran with two decades of experience handling performance-critical UI work—is now completing in a single day what previously took three weeks. ""AI needed him to provide the structure, it fleshed out the details and that required him to draw on his experience,"" Vembu explained.The Indian SaaS giant has rolled out AI coding tools company-wide but with strict guardrails. Engineers must review and approve all AI-generated code and take full responsibility for it, Vembu emphasized. Zoho doesn't mandate AI usage, instead leaving implementation decisions to experienced developers who can assess when the technology adds value.Even junior developers are seeing breakthroughs. Vembu noted that a less experienced team member built an internal tool with AI assistance that's now being used across multiple teams—work that wouldn't have been possible without the technology. For UI development specifically, Vembu's team is ""very bullish on AI.""""As Chief Scientist, I am under pressure,"" Vembu admitted, acknowledging the technology's transformative impact.

Microsoft CEO 'Thrilled' About India's Growing Data Centre Capacity, Details Meet With PM Modi





OpenAI cofounder disagrees with CEO Sam Altman on AGI timeline





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently shared what he sees as a key test for the next stage of artificial intelligence (AI). As companies race to build AI agents that can act independently, Suleyman said he is watching for a milestone he calls Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI) on the path toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). He said that the test is simple in context but difficult in execution – whether an AI agent can legally take $1,00,000 and turn it into $1 million. He described the test as “modern turing test”, suggesting it will show how AI systems can plan, reason, make decisions and operate within real-word rules.“The next big milestone I'm watching for on our way to AGI: Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI). Can an agent take $100k and legally turn it into $1M? To me that's the modern Turing Test,” Mustafa Suleyman wrote in a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter).Suleyman’s comments come as several technology leaders including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff bet heavily on AI agents as the next major shift in enterprise software. Companies such as OpenAI, Salesforce, Microsoft and others are promoting agents that can carry out tasks with limited human input, from writing code to managing business workflows.Last year, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff called the rise of AI in the workforce a “digital labor revolution,” estimating that the software company has reached about 93% accuracy with the technology.In an interview with Bloomberg then, he revealed that AI is doing up to 50% of the work at Salesforce.In 2025, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicted that AI could soon automate up to 40% of the tasks humans currently perform. He also claimed that AGI could arrive before 2030.Recently, OpenAI cofounder and AI researcher Andrej Karpathy pushed back against the “agentic AI” hype, characterizing the current generation of autonomous AI systems as “slop.” Karpathy has directly challenged the notion that autonomous AI agents are on the cusp of delivering as promised, positioning himself in contrast to the optimistic timelines often suggested by figures like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.“I feel like the industry is making too big of a jump and is trying to pretend like this is amazing, and it’s not. It’s slop,"" Karpathy said on The Dwarkesh Podcast.“They’re not coming to terms with it, and maybe they’re trying to fundraise or something like that. We’re at this intermediate stage,” he added.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman proposes a new test for advanced AI: can an agent legally grow $100,000 into $1 million?

Meet Infusion de Santal Chai.”Social media quickly caught on, with one user writing, “Omg I want to try!! Love the chai”. Another added, “Indian chai, interesting.” A third commented, “Every Indian product like kolhapuri chappal, paithani, food products and chai is also very great and perfectly useful for all world.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Strider Sekhar: Strider’s name clearly draws inspiration from Aragorn, also called ‘Strider’, the beloved ranger and king from The Lord of the Rings, a classic work of fantasy that has influenced generations. The middle name “Sekhar” is rooted in real-world achievement, paying homage to Professor Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, the Indian-American astrophysicist and Nobel laureate whose research transformed our understanding of stellar evolution. The combination reflects Musk’s penchant for blending mythic and scientific references as in this case, honouring both a heroic literary figure and a towering scientific mind.

The name’s fantastical tone fits with Musk’s well-known enthusiasm for gaming, science fiction and digital culture.

Musk’s unconventional naming tradition

Elon Musk's comment about his twins' names goes viral

Public reaction and social media buzz

In 2021, he welcomed twins named Strider and Azure with Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis. The two names are very unique and won many hearts of the fans. The name Strider is linked with movement, exploration, and adventure and the name Azure is a reference to a blue sky with a meaning that defines ""clearness and openness.” (Image Credit: Google Images)

Bottom line





Tesla, SpaceX and X CEO Elon Musk has once again made global headlines, this time not for a rocket launch or tech reveal but for a personal moment. An X (formerly Twitter) handle, Tesla Owners Silicon Valley, tweeted a picture featuring Musk with his twins and but it was Musk's proud comment on the post that has now gone viral around the world. The tweet shared a glimpse into his family life on social media as he introduced his son Strider Sekhar and daughter Comet Azure.The picture of the trio, shared by Tesla Owners Silicon Valley, was captioned, ""Elon Musk “Bringing a child into the world is a statement of optimism. We need to restore hope and excitement for the future—I believe it will surpass the past.” (sic).""Musk commented, “Me with my son, Strider Sekhar (named after Aragorn & great Indian physicist Chandrasekhar) and daughter, Comet Azure, named after the most powerful spell in Elden Ring (sic).” The tweet quickly turned into one of the platform’s most discussed moments of the week as the revelation captivated followers for several reasons: the blend of pop culture, global science lore and video-game references in the children’s names, the rare personal tone from a notoriously private billionaire and the cultural conversation it sparked online.Strider and Azure are twins born in November 2021 to Musk and Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis, conceived via IVF and welcomed alongside other children whom Musk shares with different partners.The twins were previously known publicly by their shorter names, Strider and Azure, but Musk’s new tweet elaborates on both their full names and the inspirations behind them.While the specific phrase “most powerful spell” is not independently verified by gaming sources, the reference reflects how pop culture influences naming in the tech billionaire’s circle.Elon Musk has a long history of choosing unusual, symbolic names for his children and this latest tweet confirms that tradition is very much alive.His first child with musician Grimes, for example, was named X Æ A-Xii, a name blending letters and numerals as a reflection of both parents’ interests in technology, aviation and symbolism. Other children include Exa Dark Sideræl and Techno Mechanicus with Grimes, and Seldon Lycurgus with Zilis. These names were inspired by science fiction and ancient governance respectively.In the case of Seldon Lycurgus, the name pulled from Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series and Spartan lawgiver Lycurgus, indicating the one-off but deliberate fusion of cultural and historical figures that Musk favours.The new tweet suggests that Strider Sekhar and Comet Azure are part of that same pattern of mixing cultural icons, historical figures and elements of fantasy, which is a style that has drawn both fascination and mockery online. Elon Musk’s family life, including his many children with multiple partners, periodically captures headlines.According to public records and reports, Musk has acknowledged fathering at least 14 children, including twins Strider and Azure as well as other children with Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis and previous relationships. Some of the children, like Strider and Azure, have previously appeared in family photos circulating online and Musk has on occasion interacted publicly about his kids, though he usually keeps his personal life private.The wave of discussion sparked by the recent tweet reflects not only curiosity about the unusual names but also broader interest in how public figures invoke storytelling, heritage and pop culture when choosing names for the next generation.As with many Musk-related moments, the tweet has ignited a mixed reaction online. Fans and pop culture buffs are sharing praise for the references, particularly the blended tribute to Tolkien and Chandrasekhar. Gaming communities are amused by the Elden Ring reference, seeing it as a playful nod that connects with younger audiences.Cultural commentators are noting the cross-cultural appeal of honouring both a Western literary icon and an Indian scientific pioneer in a single name, something rarely seen in high-profile naming choices. Reposts, memes and debates about name pronunciation and meaning have already spread across X, Instagram and Reddit, where Musk’s personal posts often become fodder for broader cultural discussion.While some of the chatter is light-hearted, this tweet encapsulates several larger trends in how modern public figures communicate. Musk uses social platforms to share personal tidbits that blur the boundaries between private and public identity. The choice of “Sekhar” highlights how global heritage and scientific admiration can coexist in naming traditions, reflecting broader globalisation.By invoking Elden Ring, Tolkien and historical figures, modern naming can serve as encoded signals about family interests, values and technological culture. Whether one sees the tweet as charming, eccentric or emblematic of billionaire quirkiness, it has undeniably sparked conversation about modern parenting, cultural homage and the role of symbolic names in the digital age.Elon Musk’s tweet introducing Strider Sekhar and Comet Azure gives rare insight into how one of the world’s most high-profile figures bridges fantasy, science, culture and personal identity in naming his children. By honouring both a legendary literary character and an esteemed Indian physicist, alongside a video-game-inspired name, Musk’s choices reflect a unique fusion of cultural currents that are distinctly modern, widely discussed and emblematic of his larger-than-life public persona.","Elon Musk's comment about his twins' names goes viral.

Which US states are most likely to see the Nothern lights this week

Washington



Montana



North Dakota



South Dakota also falls well within the viewing zone for this event.



Can people farther south see anything at all

What is causing this aurora event

Clouds and city lights change the experience





Northern skies do not always announce themselves. Most nights pass quietly, even when something distant is shifting above the planet. This week is slightly different. A pulse of solar activity is moving through Earth’s magnetic field, and that change may be just enough to push the northern lights into view across parts of the United States. It is not guaranteed, and it will not look the same everywhere. Some people may see soft colour low on the horizon, others nothing at all. Still, for a short window in early January, the odds tilt a little. Space weather forecasters are watching closely, and so are sky watchers, hoping the darkness offers something unexpected rather than empty for once during the coldest stretch of winter nights.The strongest chances sit far north, as they usually do. Alaska remains the most reliable place, almost separate from the rest of the map when it comes to aurora watching. Parts of:These areas lie closer to where Earth’s magnetic field funnels charged particles into the atmosphere. NOAA forecasts suggest activity could peak overnight between January 8 and January 9, though timing often slips by hours. In these states, the lights may form brighter arcs or slow-moving curtains rather than faint smudges. Even then, nothing is promised. Auroras are known for appearing briefly and fading without warning.States a little below the usual aurora belt are not entirely out of luck. Minnesota, Michigan, and Maine often sit on the edge during moderate geomagnetic storms, and this week could be another of those moments.The display in these places is usually subtle. Colour may appear washed out, sometimes closer to grey than green. It often stays low in the northern sky, easy to mistake for a cloud or distant glow. Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire, and parts of New York fall into a similar category. For viewers there, seeing the aurora often depends on patience and expectations. Many who do catch it only realise later when photos reveal more than the eye noticed at the time.The trigger comes from the Sun, though not in a dramatic, cinematic way. A coronal mass ejection has sent a stream of charged particles outward, interacting with a co rotating interaction region already moving through space. Together, they disturb Earth’s magnetic field just enough to produce a G1-level geomagnetic storm. That rating is considered minor, but minor does not mean invisible. It simply means effects are more local and less intense. Space weather remains difficult to predict with precision. Solar wind speed, density, and direction can all shift suddenly. Forecasts improve as the storm arrives, but uncertainty never fully disappears.Even the strongest aurora means little under thick cloud. Cloud cover remains the biggest reason people miss these events, regardless of solar activity. Clear skies matter more than most other factors. Light pollution is the next obstacle. Urban lighting can wash out faint auroras entirely, especially in southern locations. Rural areas, coastal stretches, and dark sky parks offer better odds. Many experienced observers suggest letting your eyes adjust and avoiding phone screens for a while. Cameras often see more than humans do, especially in low light modes. Sometimes the night still looks empty. Sometimes it does not. That uncertainty is part of the pull.","The strongest chances sit far north, as they usually do.

Coup In Britain? Starmer’s ‘Own Cabinet Plots’ His Downfall | ‘Full Bunker Mode’ In No. 10





The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true. ""The UK is set to introduce a nationwide curfew, beginning at 11pm each night,"" he appears to say on one of thousands of TikTok videos of him posted in last six months. ""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok. By Dec 19, most appeared to have been removed from the platform. Howard said the use of AI in politics is increasing rapidly. ""We know it's internationally pervasive now,"" he said. ""Four of every five elections around the world now have AI-generated political junk that is unattributed and clearly misleading.

UAE issues urgent recall of Nestle infant formula over toxin risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-issues-urgent-recall-of-nestle-infant-formula-over-toxin-risk/articleshow/126407858.cms,"Nestlé Infant Formula recall hits UAE and Gulf Markets / AI Illustration

Which products are affected?

NAN Comfort 1

NAN OPTIPRO 1

NAN SUPREME PRO 1, 2, 3

S-26 Ultima 1, 2, 3

Alfamino

Understanding the risk

The Toxin: Cereulide can cause symptoms similar to food poisoning, such as nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps.

The Resilience: Unlike many other bacteria, this toxin is heat-stable, meaning it isn't always destroyed by the boiling water used to prepare a bottle.

The Symptoms: If a child is affected, symptoms usually appear quickly, anywhere from 30 minutes to six hours after feeding.

Saudi, Qatar, Kuwait also warn



What should parents do next?

Do Not Panic: If your baby has already consumed the formula and is showing no symptoms (like repeated vomiting or unusual lethargy), there is no cause for concern.

Dispose or Return: You should either dispose of the product or return it to the point of purchase. Nestle has committed to providing full refunds for any recalled items.

Seek Advice: If you are unsure about what alternative formula to use, it is always best to consult your pediatrician.





The Emirates Drug Establishment (EDE) has announced a voluntary and precautionary recall of several Nestlé infant formula products sold in the United Arab Emirates. This recall comes after tests found traces of the Bacillus cereus bacteria in one of the raw ingredients used in these products. The bacteria can produce a toxin called cereulide, which may pose health risks if consumed.Authorities have stressed that up to now no illnesses or adverse health events linked to these batches have been reported in the UAE.The recall covers specific Nestlé infant formulas, including popular products used by caregivers:These batches have been quarantined in warehouses and are being removed from shelves, including both physical stores and online marketplaces across the UAE.It’s important to note that all other Nestlé products not included in the recall remain safe for consumption.The reason for this sudden move is the discovery of traces of Bacillus cereus bacteria in a raw material used during production.This specific bacteria can produce a toxin known as cereulide.Here is why the authorities are taking it so seriously:The EDE has confirmed that no illnesses or adverse events have been reported in the UAE so far.The recall is being handled ""out of an abundance of caution"" to ensure it stays that way.This action in the UAE is part of a broader regional response. The Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) has also warned parents in the kingdom not to use the affected products and has urged people to dispose of them immediately, emphasising it’s a precautionary recall with no reported cases of illness so far.Similarly, Qatar and Kuwait health authorities have issued warnings to consumers about possible contamination in certain Nestlé formula batches and advised caution.Across the region, regulators are working with Nestlé to ensure that all recalled batches are fully removed from retail outlets and distribution points.If you discover that you have an affected tin, the advice from health experts and regulators is simple: stop using it immediately.The UAE’s pharmaceutical and food security systems are designed to catch these issues early, and this swift recall is a testament to the country's commitment to keeping every family safe.","The Emirates Drug Establishment (EDE) has announced a voluntary and precautionary recall of several Nestlé infant formula products sold in the United Arab Emirates.

What is Dubai's Smart Rental Index?



Why are rent hikes in Dubai regulated in the first place?

Dubai Rent Increases Decoded: What Landlords Don’t Always Tell Tenants

How rent increase limits are calculated in Dubai



0% increase: If your current rent is up to 10% below the market average

5% increase: If it’s 11% to 20% below average

10% increase: If it’s 21% to 30% below average

15% increase: If it’s 31% to 40% below average

20% increase: If it’s more than 40% below average

Step-by-step: How to check if your rent increase is legal in Dubai



Visit the official DLD Rent Index page on the Dubai Land Department website. Enter your Title Deed number or manually key in your property details (area, number of rooms, contract expiry date and current annual rent). The tool calculates the average rent for similar properties nearby. It then shows the maximum legal rent increase allowed under the index bands.

What to do if your Dubai landlord demands too much



Present the official index result to the landlord in writing or via email.

Negotiate based on the legal maximum rather than the landlord’s figure.

File a complaint with the Rental Dispute Centre (RDC) at the Dubai Land Department, where the index can be used as statutory evidence to challenge unfair increases.

Bottom line: Rent transparency in Dubai







As Dubai’s rental market continues to evolve amid strong demand and population growth, tenants often grapple with rising rents and the question: Is this rent increase even legal ? Fortunately, the Dubai Land Department’s Smart Rental Index, an AI-powered official tool, now gives residents a clear way to check whether a rent hike proposed by a landlord is justified under UAE law.Whether you are renewing your lease, debating negotiations or simply planning your budget, understanding how rent hikes are regulated in Dubai is essential. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how the system works and how tenants can protect themselves from arbitrary increases.At the core of Dubai’s rent regulation framework is the Smart Rental Index, a sophisticated tool developed by the Dubai Land Department (DLD) to determine fair rental values across the emirate. Unlike the older system, which was updated annually by broad district averages, the Smart Index uses AI and detailed building-level data, including construction quality, services, maintenance standards and location, to produce real-time average rent figures for specific buildings and neighbourhoods.The index covers all residential areas of Dubai, including freehold communities and leasehold zones and helps both tenants and landlords benchmark rental rates against current market conditions.Under Dubai’s tenancy laws (including Decree No. 43 of 2013 and subsequent DLD regulations), landlords cannot arbitrarily raise rent each year. Instead, rent increases are permitted only during lease renewal and only if the Smart Rental Index supports the hike.Importantly, landlords must also provide tenants with a written notice at least 90 days before the expiry of the tenancy contract if they wish to raise rent or change any contract terms. Failing to provide this notice makes the increase invalid under the law, even if the index allows it.These rules are designed to promote market transparency and protect tenants from sudden, excessive rent hikes that could destabilise household finances.Dubai’s rent increase system sets strict limits on how much landlords can legally increase rent, based on how the tenant’s current rent compares with the average market rent shown in the Smart Rental Index -These bands help ensure that rent adjustments are fair and reflect genuine market trends rather than landlord discretion. They are automatically applied by the Smart Rental Index tool when you perform a legal rent check.Tenants in Dubai can easily verify whether a proposed rent increase complies with the official rules by using the online rent calculator provided by the Dubai Land Department:You can access this service via the Dubai REST app, the DLD website under e-services or the DubaiNow app, all of which provide the same official data.

Candace Owens’ latest claim about Charlie Kirk draws sharp backlash on social media





A single Instagram story sent political media into overdrive late Thursday after Candace Owens claimed she had reached a decisive conclusion about a case that has long fueled online speculation. Not only did the post, which was shared on her verified account, immediately result in backlash, unbelief, and a new argument about the responsibility in high reach commentary, but it was also widely discussed and unliked.The response escalated in a few minutes as critics charged Owens of promoting conspiracy driven stories about Charlie Kirk , who is still alive. The next thing that ensued was a quick clash of assertions, counter assertions and social media scrutiny with some wondering when it is too far to take speculation to declarative.Owens wrote in her Instagram story, “Think I may officially solved the WHY Charlie Kirk was murdered. Today’s episode is my official theory as to WHY and it neatly ties in Israel, Evangelical Churches, and his last trip to Asia.” The wording, presented without qualifiers, quickly raised alarms among journalists and commentators who stressed the importance of factual clarity.The controversy grew after social media account Cinema Shogun amplified the post, writing, “Candace Owens just officially announced that she believes she has FINALLY SOLVED why Charlie Kirk was murdered.”The account added pointed criticism, stating, “After months of spreading FAKE THEORIES she’s now ready to RELEASE her ‘official theory’ behind what happened.”Cinema Shogun further challenged Owens’ credibility by asking, “Is this an ADMISSION that she’s just been completely WASTING EVERYONES TIME with all of the other theories for the last three months?” The post concluded with a sharp claim, saying, “Everything else she put out has been DEBUNKED so now she’s pretending like those were never her ‘Official’ theories.”Supporters rushed to Owens’ defense, arguing she was speaking hypothetically. Detractors were unconvinced, warning that phrasing matters when audiences span millions.

MrBeast pushes back against ‘toxic’ One Piece fans in viral clip





What was supposed to be a lighthearted moment resulted in an internet argument after MrBeast publicly shared his anger towards sections of the One Piece community. One very brief video posted to the internet went viral, drawing supporters and detractors into a conversation they already had about gatekeeping in pop culture. It was not only the words, but the tone of weariness beneath them, that was interesting.The backlash began with something simple. MrBeast had changed his X profile picture to Luffy, a central character from One Piece. That small move triggered accusations that he was chasing trends. Instead of brushing it off, he responded on camera, making it clear that the criticism had crossed a line.In the clip, a voice off camera mentions, “There are a couple of tweets about you saying, ‘Should I watch One Piece?’” MrBeast paused, then reacted with visible shock, saying, “Two things, before I answer that, Holy s***!” The profanity reflected his disbelief at how intense the reaction had become.As the clip continued, MrBeast defended his history as an anime fan. He pushed back against claims that he was an outsider trying to ride hype. “I’ve seen more anime than all of you little anime clowns with your anime PFPs,” he said. He followed it up by adding, “I’ve been tweeting about anime before some of you mfs were born… I’ve watched all 700 episodes of Naruto.” The curse words were sharp, but the message was clear. He felt dismissed by a community that prides itself on passion.MrBeast also rejected the label of being an “anime tourist.” He pointed to his long standing interest in series beyond mainstream hits, including “Legend of the Galactic Heroes.” His frustration centered on fans who question others instead of welcoming them.Online reactions remain divided. Some accused him of overreacting, while others supported his stance against gatekeeping. The moment highlights a larger issue in fandom culture.

UAE tightens school safety rules; makes exit permits compulsory for students,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-tightens-school-safety-rules-makes-exit-permits-compulsory-for-students/articleshow/126388402.cms,"UAE makes exit permits compulsory for students / AI Generated Image

UAE's new exit permit rule 2026

‘Friday trap’ warnings

The 1-Day Warning: A written notice is issued after just one unexcused absence.

The 6-Day Referral: By the sixth day of absence, the case is escalated to the Child Protection Unit.

The 15-Day Limit: If a student accumulates 15 unexcused days in a single academic year, the consequences are severe. The file is referred to external child protection agencies, and the student may even be required to repeat the entire academic year.

What parents must know?

Certified medical illness or travel for treatment.

Bereavement (death of a close relative).

Participation in official national or international events.

Emergency situations like natural disasters or ""force majeure.""





The UAE has rolled out a new rule that no student will be allowed to leave school grounds without an official exit permit from the school. This change comes as part of broader efforts by education authorities to strengthen student safety, discipline and supervision during school dismissal times.Officials emphasise that this is not just a bureaucratic step, it’s aimed at preventing unauthorised departures and ensuring schools can reliably account for every child at the end of the school day.The most significant change for families this year is the introduction of the mandatory ""Exit Permit."" Gone are the days of informal pick-ups; now, every student requires an official document to pass through the school gates at the end of the day.To secure this permit, parents are required to play an active role in the paperwork.You will need to provide a recent passport-sized photograph of your child and a copy of your Emirates ID. However, it isn't just a digital transaction. School administrations now require parents to attend in person to sign a written undertaking.This document clearly defines how the student will travel home, whether by bus, private car, or walking, and officially assigns responsibility to the person collecting themWhile there is a nominal fee for issuing these permits, school officials stress that this system is a non-negotiable prerequisite for student safety.It isn’t just the exit gates that are getting stricter; the Ministry of Education has also overhauled attendance tracking with a rigorous escalation system.If a student misses school without a valid excuse, the ""warning clock"" starts immediately.Parents should also be aware of what many are calling the ""Friday Trap."" Under the new rules, an unexcused absence on a Friday, or on days immediately before or after a public holiday, counts as two days against the student’s limit.This measure is specifically designed to discourage families from extending weekends or holidays without prior approval.To help families stay on top of these rules, the Ministry is rolling out an instant messaging system. Parents will now receive real-time notifications the moment their child is marked absent or late. However, the government recognizes that life happens. According to the latest guidelines, there are eight officially recognized excuses that will not result in penalties.These include:Documentation for these absences must be submitted within five working days. Schools are also required to create ""Individual Support Plans"" for students who struggle with attendance, offering counseling and motivational programs rather than just discipline.These new rules are part of a broader ""Student Protection Policy"" championed by authorities like ADEK (Abu Dhabi Department of Education and Knowledge) and the Ministry of Education. The goal is to create a ""locked-down"" environment where student safety is guaranteed from the moment they step onto the bus until they are safely back in their parents' care.By requiring ""mandated reporting"" from all school staff and using smart gate technology, the UAE is aligning its education system with global safety standards. As school leaders have noted, chronic absenteeism can set a student back by an entire year of achievement.","The UAE has rolled out a new rule that no student will be allowed to leave school grounds without an official exit permit from the school.

Farmers: Take immediate precautions to protect frost-sensitive crops in northern and western desert regions.

Emergency Contact: For any weather-related emergencies, residents are urged to contact the hotline at 112.





Meteorology departments across the Gulf have issued a weather alert for strong winds and significantly reduced visibility, particularly in Kuwait , with impacts likely felt in coastal and inland areas today. Officials warn that northwesterly winds exceeding 60 km/h will sweep through parts of the region, bringing dust, blowing sand, and horizontal visibility dropping below 1,000 meters in exposed spots.Kuwait is bracing for a day of turbulent weather as the Meteorological Department issues a stern warning for Monday, January 5, 2026. A powerful northwesterly wind system is set to dominate the skyline, with speeds expected to roar past 60 km/h. This isn’t just a breeze; the sheer force of the wind is predicted to kick up significant dust and sand across the country, turning the blue skies into a hazy brown.For those heading out, the impact will be immediate. Horizontal visibility is expected to plummet to less than 1,000 meters in several regions. In open desert areas and along highways, experts warn that visibility could occasionally hit zero due to sand drifting.If you are commuting between cities, expect a ""whiteout"" effect, only this time, it’s made of desert sand.Alongside strong winds, Kuwait’s Meteorological Department has also issued a cold weather warning, cautioning that minimum temperatures are expected to drop below 3°C, raising the risk of frost formation in agricultural and desert areas. The frost alert is in effect from 1:30am to 8:30am on Monday, January 5, with authorities urging farmers and residents in open areas to take precautionary measures to protect crops, livestock and outdoor equipment. The warning was issued shortly after 1:00am, highlighting a sharp overnight temperature drop.The chaos isn't limited to the land. Mariners and beachgoers are being told to stay clear of the water as the ""freshening"" northwesterly winds wreak havoc on sea conditions. The Meteorological Department has confirmed that waves in the Arabian Gulf could surge to heights of 6 to 7 feet.This ""rough to very rough"" sea state poses a significant risk to small boats and fishing vessels. Authorities have officially advised against all marine activities until the wind activity subsides. The warning is currently slated to remain in peak effect from 10:00 AM until 4:00 PM, though choppy conditions may persist well into the evening.As the dust begins to settle, a different kind of weather threat is creeping in: a biting cold snap. Following the wind shift, temperatures are expected to take a dramatic dive. Forecasters have issued a rare frost warning for agricultural and desert areas, with minimum temperatures potentially dipping below 3°C.This sudden drop in mercury follows a period of relatively mild weather, making the change feel even more severe. The Ministry of Health has urged residents, especially those with respiratory conditions like asthma or allergies, to stay indoors to avoid the dual threat of fine dust particles and the freezing air. For those who must go out, wearing N95 masks is highly recommended to filter out the PM2.5 pollutants carried by the wind.The Ministry of Interior (MoI) and the Meteorological Department have activated emergency protocols to manage the fallout from the shifting pressure systems. Acting Director of the Meteorology Department, Dhirar Al-Ali, stated that the country is currently under the influence of a ""deep surface low-pressure system,"" which is driving the atmospheric instability.To stay safe, authorities recommend the following:Similar conditions have appeared in recent months across the Gulf. Strong winds and blowing dust have prompted earlier warnings of reduced visibility and hazardous seas in Kuwait and neighbouring Gulf states, as noted by meteorology departments in routine forecasts.This kind of northwesterly wind pattern is common during transitional weather periods and can stir up dust storms, further robbing the air of clarity and increasing the risk of travel delays.","Strong winds, dust storms, and a sharp temperature drop are sweeping across Kuwait.

Burj Khalifa as a vision of height and how it grew taller



Burj Khalifa’s breakthrough: Buttressed core system



Burj Khalifa’s engineering against the elements: Wind, heat, sand



Burj Khalifa’s safety, sustainability and built in innovation



Burj Khalifa: A legacy that is larger than its height







When the Burj Khalifa opened on January 4, 2010, it did not just take the title of the world’s tallest building, it announced Dubai to the world as a hub of ambition, innovation and architectural daring. More than a decade later, architects and engineers still marvel at how it was done and how the structure continues to stand as a benchmark of engineering excellence. At the centre of that success is Bill Baker, the structural engineer whose pioneering designs made the 828-metre landmark possible.Read on as we explore the groundbreaking systems and safety features that not only helped build Burj Khalifa but keep it safe, stable and relevant in 2026, by design as much as by physics.Did you know that the original concept for the Burj Khalifa was not always as tall as it is today? The building began life planned for about 518 metres but as engineers tested and refined the design, they realised it was possible to go much higher while keeping stability and cost efficiency in check. Through iterative wind-tunnel experiments and modelling, the team increased the design by another 310 metres, roughly the height of the Eiffel Tower, without compromising safety or performance.This refinement was not just ambition, it was engineering evolution. From the outset, the project’s core team, led by Emaar Properties and coordinated with global experts, approached the build with flexibility and scientific rigour. The result is not just a taller building but a smarter one.At the heart of Burj Khalifa’s structural resilience is an innovative design known as the “buttressed core”, a concept developed by Baker and his colleagues at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM). This system uses a central reinforced core shaped like an irregular hexagon, with three wings extending outward in a Y-shaped plan.For its torsional stability, the hexagonal core acts much like an axle, resisting twists and turns that wind forces cause at great heights. For wind resistance, each wing buttresses the others, distributing load evenly and making the structure incredibly stable even in strong gusts. Burj Khalifa's aerodynamic efficiency is credited to the unusual shape that helps “confuse the wind”, so vortices don’t form consistently around the surface, dramatically reducing oscillation forces.This structural system made it possible for Burj Khalifa to break previous height records by a huge margin, not incrementally but dramatically. It is a standard-setter that has since influenced other super-tall buildings around the world.Dubai’s environmental conditions presented unique challenges. With summer temperatures often exceeding 50 °C and desert winds exerting unpredictable force, the design team needed solutions on multiple fronts. For the wind tunnel testing, the team conducted over 40 wind tunnel analyses to model how the building would respond to every possible force, adjusting setbacks and facade angles accordingly.For concrete and cladding, special cladding panels (about 26,000 of them) were hand-cut to fit perfectly and minimise thermal and light stress. Ultra-reflective materials protect the structure from heat gain. For its foundations, instead of sitting directly on loose sand, Burj Khalifa rises from a reinforced concrete mat supported by deep bored piles, anchoring the entire 828-metre tower on solid ground.Beyond these classical engineering feats, modern protective technologies like cathodic corrosion protection help guard steel reinforcement in the foundation from salt-rich groundwater, ensuring a long lifespan for the structure at its base.The Burj Khalifa was designed long before “sustainability” became a global buzzword, yet some of its features anticipated today’s priorities. Its efficient skin design is such that because of its Y-plan, only one-sixth of the building’s surface is exposed to direct sunlight at any time, which reduces solar heat gain and improves cooling efficiency.For fresh water harvesting, instead of letting condensate from air-conditioning systems drain away, the building’s design captures the equivalent of 20 Olympic-size pools of water each year, which is a hidden but smart reuse strategy. For climate-responsive comforts, higher floors benefit from cooler temperatures and clearer air, making upper-level conditions surprisingly pleasant despite the desert environment.From energy efficiency to water management, Burj Khalifa’s design anticipated elements of today’s sustainability standards long before they were industry norms.Fifteen years after opening, the Burj Khalifa stands not just as an architectural icon but as a symbol of what coordinated vision and structural innovation can achieve. Bill Baker himself described the tower as a statement of optimism and ambition, which was part engineering marvel and part cultural milestone that inspires millions of visitors every year.The “Burj Effect” goes beyond tourism as properties with views of the skyscraper command premium prices and the building’s presence reshaped Dubai’s skyline and global image. For Baker and the original design team, the real reward is not just in the height record or technical achievements, it is in seeing how the building continues to stand tall, safe and relevant more than a decade after its completion.Looking ahead, experts say that Burj Khalifa’s core concepts will continue to influence future tall-building design, even as materials and technologies evolve. Baker has hinted that even taller structures, potentially breaching the kilometre mark, are possible, though they would likely require new structural systems and solutions for challenges like vertical transportation and pressure changes at extreme heights.In the meantime, Burj Khalifa remains a testament to the blend of human ambition, scientific rigour and architectural artistry. It is a building that did not just redefine Dubai but reshaped what the world believes is possible in vertical architecture.","The Burj Khalifa opened on January 4, 2010.

Noise from vehicles can disrupt residents, particularly in family neighbourhoods and sandy outskirts, causing distress to children, the elderly and individuals with medical sensitivities.This enforcement effort comes as part of a broader push to curb reckless driving, curb noise pollution and promote courteous behaviour on the roads. Officers have specifically targeted drivers, often younger motorists, operating vehicles with modified exhausts, unleashed engines or ritually revving machines in residential districts, family campsites and sandy zones near homes.Under Article 20 of the Traffic and Circulation Law, motorists who operate vehicles that cause excessive noise face a Dh2,000 fine and a deduction of 12 black points from their driving licence if found violating the law. These penalties can significantly impact a driver’s record and insurance eligibility over time.In addition to fines for noise, police are also cracking down on unauthorised modifications to engines or chassis, another major contributor to sound pollution. Drivers who make such modifications without approval may face a Dh1,000 fine, 12 traffic points and possible impoundment of their vehicle for up to 30 days under Law No. 5 of 2020. Vehicles impounded for illegal modifications can only be released after paying a Dh10,000 release fee, and if left unclaimed for three months, they may be auctioned off.Authorities have backed up these warnings with action. In a coordinated enforcement operation in Al Ain in early 2025, police seized 106 vehicles found to have excessive modifications that caused loud noise disturbances, highlighting that enforcement isn’t limited to warnings alone but includes real consequences for violators.Officials frame this crackdown as about more than just reducing noise. It is part of enhancing road safety, community wellbeing and traffic order. Loud vehicles and reckless driving habits can distract other road users, potentially increasing the risk of accidents. Noise pollution is also broadly seen as an “uncivilised behaviour” that tarnishes the image of neighbourhoods and disrupts day-to-day life.Abu Dhabi Police have actively encouraged members of the public to report noisy or disruptive vehicles by calling the emergency number (999). This community-assisted approach emphasizes that residents have a role to play in shaping safer, quieter streets.Loud cars and vehicle modifications have become increasingly popular among certain driving enthusiast groups in the UAE, especially those who enjoy customised engines and aftermarket upgrades. However, police have repeatedly reminded motorists that unauthorised enhancements that amplify noise or alter performance are against the law and subject to penalties.Online discussions from local drivers reflect mixed feelings about the enforcement. Some argue that normal engine sounds from stock vehicles should not count as violations, while others emphasize responsible driving behaviour, particularly in residential zones where noise can cause anxiety and stress.RedditIf you drive in Abu Dhabi or plan to visit from another emirate, here’s how to ensure you avoid a hefty fine and black points on your licence:Ultimately, the new enforcement marks a shift towards prioritising everyone’s right to a safe, peaceful environment. Whether you live in a bustling neighbourhood or pass through Abu Dhabi’s streets on the way to work or leisure, these rules remind drivers that personal enjoyment should never come at the expense of public safety and community harmony.As 2026 unfolds, road users in Abu Dhabi, from enthusiastic petrolheads to daily commuters, will be keen to adapt to these measures, ensuring that the emirate’s streets are not just free-flowing but also free from unnecessary noise and disruption.Abu Dhabi’s increasingly stringent approach is part of a wider UAE trend of enhancing road rules and penalties for a variety of traffic violations, from dangerous manoeuvres to excessive vehicle noise. Across the country, authorities actively use technology and patrols to enforce regulations and educate drivers on safety best practices","Abu Dhabi is doubling down on road safety and community peace with an intensified campaign against noisy driving and disruptive vehicles.

Dubai bans beloved BBQ tradition at Jebel Hafeet: Is this overreach?



Barbecue Tradition Meets a Hard Stop at Jebel Hafeet in Dubai: Here’s What’s Changed





Dubai-area officials have introduced a new rule that is catching weekend warriors and outdoor lovers by surprise. Barbecues are now banned in several parking areas at Jebel Hafeet in Al Ain, one of the UAE’s most beloved mountain getaways. Visitors caught lighting up grills in prohibited spots can face fines that escalate with repeated violations, up to Dh4,000 on the third offence, as authorities clamp down on littering and misuse of the scenic site.Jebel Hafeet, with its dramatic mountain road, sprawling views and family-friendly Green Mubazzarah Park, attracts hundreds of thousands of residents and tourists each year, especially during the cooler months. However, growing concern over environmental impact and mounting waste left behind by visitors has led the Department of Municipalities and Transport and Al Ain City Municipality to take action. Multiple warning signs placed across several parking lots and popular picnic spots now clearly spell out that “barbecue/BBQ is strictly prohibited in this area. ”The penalty framework comes from Law No. 2 of 2012 concerning the Preservation of Public Appearance, Health and Tranquility in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, which imposes a Dh1,000 fine for first-time non-compliance, Dh2,000 for repeated violations and Dh4,000 for subsequent offences, giving authorities a stronger tool to protect the area’s natural beauty and visitor experience.For generations, gatherings around BBQs at scenic venues like Jebel Hafeet have been a weekend staple for UAE families and friends, with visitors often packing food and grills to enjoy the cool mountain air. However, the new restrictions echo past efforts in the region to preserve sensitive outdoor sites as similar rules have been enforced at deserts and parks where litter and irresponsible fire use posed environmental and safety risks.Local social media discussions reflect mixed reactions. Some people lament the loss of a beloved tradition, while others point to the environmental cost of charcoal waste and litter left behind after picnics, noting that stricter enforcement may be necessary to safeguard delicate mountain ecosystems and keep the area inviting for future visitors.While barbecuing on Jebel Hafeet’s parking lots and roadside spots is now off-limits, authorities consistently remind residents and tourists that designated areas in public parks across Abu Dhabi, including Al Sulaimi and Al Mebrazah parks, still permit BBQ gatherings in a responsible and regulated way.In short, if you are planning a scenic winter outing to Jebel Hafeet this season, portable or personal grills need to be left at home or limited to official BBQ zones. The ban aims to balance enjoyment of the mountain’s natural charm with preserving the environment and ensuring that everyone can continue to enjoy the stunning landscape for many years to come.","Dubai-area officials have introduced a new rule that is catching weekend warriors and outdoor lovers by surprise.

Secondary school timings





Boys: 7.10am to 10.30am

Girls: 8am to 11.30am

Private schools and early childhood centres







Wider implications for families









From January 9, schools across the UAE will shorten Fridays, allowing students from kindergarten to grade 12 to leave earlier. The change aligns with the updated 12.45pm Friday prayer time and gives families more time for religious observance, reflecting a nationwide effort to balance academic schedules with cultural and spiritual commitments.Kindergarten classes will run from 8am until 11.30am. For Cycle 1 students, covering grades 1 to 4, schools will use staggered schedules to manage classroom and transport logistics:These changes are designed to allow parents enough time to pick up their children and attend Friday prayers without rushing, while still completing the required curriculum hours.For students in Cycles 2 and 3, which include grades 6 to 12, the Ministry has announced separate timings for boys and girls:In addition, schools may offer online learning for students in Grade 6 and above on Fridays. Such arrangements require consultation with parents and approval from the Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA). This measure is intended to provide flexibility while maintaining academic continuity.Dubai’s KHDA recently confirmed that all private schools and early childhood centres within private schools will end lessons by 11.30am on Fridays starting January 9. Many schools have already begun sending circulars to parents, informing them of the revised hours.The adjustment follows the nationwide shift of Friday prayer times to 12.45pm, as confirmed by the General Authority for Islamic Affairs, Awqaf and Zakat. KHDA emphasized that schools have the flexibility to implement staggered or phased dismissal arrangements to meet operational and academic needs while minimizing disruption to teaching and learning.While the change is mainly aligned with religious timings, parents note that it also affects daily routines beyond the classroom. Earlier dismissal impacts traffic flow, workplace arrangements, and childcare schedules. Families particularly feel the pressure in the short window between school pick-up and Friday prayers, highlighting the practical ripple effects of the new timing.KHDA officially described the move as a careful balance between student's overall well-being and curriculum requirements, ensuring that learning continues effectively while also giving families the opportunity to participate in Friday prayers.","From January 9, schools across the UAE will shorten Fridays, allowing students from kindergarten to grade 12 to leave earlier.

It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

If you have any queries for Dhirendra Kumar you can drop us an email at: toi.business@timesinternet.in

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings



Posters, paperwork and early marketing

A wide-ranging collection of Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings and some of Apple’s earliest products has gone up for auction as the company approaches its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2026. The sale is being handled by RR Auction, which has opened bidding on 191 items spanning Jobs’ early life and Apple’s formative period in the mid-1970s.Among the centrepieces of the auction is the first known cheque issued by Apple Computer, Inc. on March 16, 1976. Signed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, the $500 cheque was made out to Howard Cantin, who designed the printed circuit board for the Apple-1 computer. The document predates Apple’s official incorporation and is described by the auction house as a foundational artefact from the company’s earliest days.Also drawing strong interest is the earliest known prototype motherboard for the Apple-1, alongside other rare hardware from Apple’s pre-Macintosh era. Early bidding has already pushed some items into the tens of thousands of dollars, with expectations that final prices could climb far higher.The auction also includes a functional Lisa-1 computer, a key transitional machine that preceded Apple’s Macintosh line, as well as a first-generation iPhone that was later jailbroken by teenage hacker George Hotz.Together, the items trace Apple’s evolution from a garage-based start-up to a consumer electronics giant.Adding a more personal dimension, the collection features items from Jobs’ childhood and teenage years, provided to the auction house by his stepbrother, John Chovanec. These include bowties, Bob Dylan 8-track tapes, and the wooden desk from Jobs’ bedroom at the Los Altos, California home later associated with the famed “Apple garage”.Other personal effects include components from Jobs’ own Apple-1 computer, hand-annotated car repair manuals, and a short handwritten note to his father on an early Apple business card.Rounding out the auction are original Apple marketing posters from the 1970s and 1980s, along with internal documents and ephemera from the company’s earliest phase. Together, the items offer a rare, material record of Apple’s origins and the personal world of its co-founder.Bidding for the collection is open until January 29, with interest expected to grow as the anniversary year approaches.","Collection of Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings and some of Apple’s earliest products has gone up for auction as the company approaches its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2026.
