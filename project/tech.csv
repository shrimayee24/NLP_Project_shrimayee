OpenAI's Master Plan for India





Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff has declared that he will not use ChatGPT, the AI chatbot developed by Microsoft-backed AI company OpenAI . His comments came after he used Google’s latest AI model, Gemini 3.0, stating that a two-hour experience with Google’s new model has convinced him to switch permanently. Google CEO Sundar Pichai termed the Gemini 3 as the company’s “most intelligent model, that combines all of Gemini’s capabilities together so you can bring any idea to life. ”In a post on X, Benioff claimed that Gemini 3.0 has brought a monumental shift in the AI landscape. The CEO specifically praised Gemini 3’s performance across multiple modalities, noting key improvements in reasoning, speed, image quality, and video processing as the compelling factors behind his decision.“Holy shit. I’ve used ChatGPT every day for 3 years. Just spent 2 hours on Gemini 3. I’m not going back. The leap is insane — reasoning, speed, images, video… everything is sharper and faster. It feels like the world just changed, again. ❤️ 🤖”Benioff’s endorsement highlights the competitive pressure now facing OpenAI as models from rival tech giants like Google make significant advances. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and even OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman praised Pichai following the launch of Gemini 3.The xAI founder said “Congrats” on Pichai’s ""Geminiii"" announcement on X, and “Nice Work” to Demis Hassabis, the chief of DeepMind. Altman posted “Congrats to Google on Gemini 3! Looks like a great model.”Altman even noted potential “temporary economic headwinds” in an internal memo but expressed confidence in OpenAl’s rapid progress and leadership in the Al race.“We have built enough strength as a company to weather great models shipping elsewhere competition... (so), having most of our research team focused on really getting to superintelligence is critically important,” Altman wrote in the internal memo sent to employees.Stripe CEO Patrick Collison also posted on X that Gemini 3 built him an “interactive web page summarising 10 breakthroughs in genetics,” and called it “pretty cool.”Nvidia also responded to Google's stock rally, with a company stating 'We're delighted by Google's success—they've made great advances in AI, and we continue to supply them.' However, this diplomatic response came amid reports that Google's AI chips (TPUs) could potentially challenge Nvidia's market dominance, particularly after news emerged that Meta was in talks to purchase billions of dollars worth of Google's tensor processing units. Despite Google's stock hitting all-time highs and rising over 120% since April, while Nvidia's shares dipped following the competitive news, Nvidia emphasised its leadership position, noting it remains 'a generation ahead of the industry.'","Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff has declared that he will not use ChatGPT, the AI chatbot developed by Microsoft-backed AI company OpenAI.

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Disruption will come from the unexpected





Take lessons from the dot-com era









Billionaire investor and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban has now issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and Meta. Cuban has argued that all these companies are overspending in the race to build the world’s most powerful AI model. As reported by Business Insider, speaking in the Pioneers of AI podcast, Cuban compared today’s AI arms race to the search engine boom of 1990s. The search engine boom ultimately ended with Google dominating the market and leaving all the rivals behind.“You’ve got five, six, whatever it is, companies that are trying to create the ultimate foundational model that we all depend on,” Cuban said. “It’s almost like in the ’90s when all the search engines were competing pre-Google… Now, we know with search engines it’s Google, and then there’s Bing, as, like, 1 or 2% and DuckDuckGo has got a half a percent. So it’s effectively a winner-take-all.”Like many other world leaders and analysts, Cuban has also cautioned that the massive investments done on AI could ultimately lead to the creation of a bubble. “They may be overspending,” he said.“And if they overspend or get too caught up, the bubble is in the competition between all those models because that could pop just like that with any new technology.”Along with this, he also raised concerns about the infrastructure costs behind AI, majorly the massive and expensive data centers which are being built to power large models. “I just can’t imagine over a 10-year period that we aren’t going to improve the technology enough that if you overspend on today’s technology, it just doesn’t feel right to me,” Cuban added.Cuban also emphasised that the disruption AI will not come from incremental improvements but from something “incredible” that no one sees coming. “Somebody’s going to come up with some incredible shit, right? If I knew what it was, I’d do it,” he said, suggesting that the current race may be blindsided by a breakthrough outside the existing competition.Cuban said he recognizes the same mix of hype, excitement, and overspending now playing out in AI. “They anticipate for at least another decade spending every penny they have,” he said of the major model developers. “I mean, if that’s not ripe for disruption to come up with better ways, I don’t know what is.”","Billionaire investor and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban has issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and Meta.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Driving in the UAE comes with responsibilities, and the Black Points System is at the heart of keeping roads safe for everyone. Introduced to curb reckless driving and reduce accidents, it assigns points to your license for traffic violations. Accumulating these points can lead to hefty fines, vehicle impoundment, or even license suspension. For both residents and visitors, understanding how black points work, which violations carry them, and how to check your status is essential. Staying informed can help you avoid penalties and ensure a smoother, safer driving experience across all emirates.Black points are penalties assigned to a driver’s license for traffic violations. Introduced in July 2017 under Ministerial Resolution No. 178/2017, the system applies across all UAE emirates, including Dubai and Abu Dhabi.Violations are recorded using an advanced network of cameras, radars, and AI-powered monitoring systems. Once a violation is detected and confirmed, drivers typically receive an SMS notification within 48 hours detailing the offense, the fine, and the number of black points added.The system is designed not only to penalize drivers financially but also to track repeat offenses, which can ultimately lead to license suspension or mandatory retraining. It ensures safer roads and consistently encourages responsible driving behavior, moreover supporting long-term compliance.The UAE uses a 24 point scale to manage driving penalties:License suspension periods are based on how many times the 24 point limit is reached:Drivers can monitor their black points in several ways:In addition to black points, violations can also result in hefty fines, vehicle impoundment, and a daily impoundment fee of Dh100.The UAE enforces 143 federal traffic laws, each with penalties to maintain road discipline. Some of the most common violations include:These penalties are carefully designed to encourage responsible driving and protect all road users.Checking your black points is simple and can help you avoid penalties:Regular monitoring ensures you are aware of your points and prevents unexpected license suspensions or retraining requirements.By following these practices, drivers can stay safe, avoid fines, and prevent their license from being suspended.","Black points are penalties assigned to a driver’s license for traffic violations.

Paul Ekman, a psychologist who linked thousands of facial expressions to the emotions they often subconsciously conveyed, and who used his research to advise FBI interrogators and screeners for the Transportation Security Administration as well as Hollywood animators, died Nov 17 at his home in San Francisco. He was 91.Ekman sought to add scientific exactitude to the human impulse to interpret how others feel through their facial expressions. He recorded 18 types of smiles, for example, distinguishing between a forced smile and a spontaneous one; a genuine smile, he discovered, crinkles the orbicularis oculi muscle - that is, it creates crow's feet around the eyes.Sometimes described as the world's most famous face reader, Ekman was influential in reshaping the way facial expressions were understood - as the product of evolution rather than environment - and his findings crossed over to popular culture.As a young researcher in the late 1960s, Ekman changed the scientific consensus on facial expressions. In the postwar era, the conventional wisdom of eminent anthropologists like Margaret Mead was that human facial expressions were learned and that they varied across cultures. Ekman believed otherwise. He showed photographs of people making faces expressing 30 different emotions - including anger, joy and fear - to subjects in the United States, Japan and South America.Across cultures, the study's participants linked the expressions they were shown with the same emotions.He then travelled to Papua New Guinea with a colleague, Wallace V Friesen, and showed the same pictures to some 300 Indigenous people who had no exposure to modern media and could not have learned to interpret faces that way. These subjects also connected the expressions to the same emotions.""There is a pan-cultural element in facial expressions of emotion,"" Ekman wrote in a paper in 1970 on returning to the United States.","Paul Ekman, a psychologist who linked thousands of facial expressions to the emotions they often subconsciously conveyed, died Nov 17 at his home in San Francisco.

Why the US limits updates and weapons access even for its allies

Why the F-35 stands beyond Russian fifth-gen capability

Inside the satellite-driven combat network that makes the F-35 nearly invisible





NEW DELHI: The ""Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II"" is not just another fighter jet — it is a geopolitical instrument, a technological ecosystem and the most widely exported fifth-generation aircraft ever produced. No other defence platform in the modern era has reshaped alliances, altered regional balances of power, or influenced international diplomacy the way the F-35 has. From Europe to West Asia, from the Indo-Pacific to Nato’s forward edge, the aircraft has become a tool through which Washington strengthens partnerships, discourages adversaries, builds influence and enforces compliance.The F-35 represents more than stealth — it represents networked warfare, real-time intelligence fusion and precision strike capability that allows pilots to “see first, fire first and disappear.” A US analyst once summarised the aircraft in one sentence: The F-35 is what happens when a jet becomes a computer that kills.Its strategic dominance is the reason states compete to buy it — and also why Washington tightly controls who receives it, at what configuration, when upgrades are released, and what internal code becomes accessible. The F-35 is both a fighter and a foreign-policy lever.As the United States tries to rebalance the Middle East through fighter jet diplomacy and trade, a proposed sale of its most advanced combat aircraft, the F-35, to Saudi Arabia has put Israel firmly at the centre of the debate.The potential deal, discussed during Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit to the White House and his talks with US President Donald Trump, envisages Riyadh joining the exclusive club of F-35 operators. But officials and reports say the Saudi jets, if the sale goes through, will be delivered in a less advanced configuration than those flown by Israel, in line with Washington’s long-standing commitment to preserve Israel’s qualitative military edge in the region.According to Reuters, US officials have indicated that the F-35s planned for Saudi Arabia will lack some of the superior features installed on Israel’s fleet, including advanced weapons systems and electronic warfare equipment. Israel, which has been operating the F-35 for roughly eight years, enjoys unique permissions to modify its aircraft, integrating its own weapons and adding radar-jamming and other upgrades without seeking fresh US approval. Still, the Israeli Air Force has opposed the proposed Saudi sale, warning in a position paper to political leaders that it could erode Israel’s air superiority in the region, The Times of Israel reported. Defence experts also note that even if Saudi Arabia gets the jets, it is unlikely to receive the AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile, the next-generation air-to-air weapon being developed for fifth-generation platforms, as Douglas Birkey of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies has pointed out.A fifth-generation fighter jet is not simply a more modern aircraft — it is a leap in how air warfare is fought, sensed, processed and won. Fourth-generation jets like the F-16, Su-30 or Mirage 2000 are machines of speed, thrust and manoeuvre, designed for visual-range engagements with radar as their primary sensor. Fifth-generation fighters are not built merely to fight — they are built to detect, decide and destroy without ever being seen.In military terms, a fifth-generation fighter is defined by a convergence of technologies rather than a single capability. The first is stealth. These aircraft are engineered to minimise radar cross-section through angled geometry, radar-absorbent composites, internal weapons bays that eliminate external drag signatures, and infrared suppression to reduce heat signature. Unlike earlier fighters, which radiate powerfully when scanning for threats, fifth-generation jets can enter heavily defended airspace without announcing themselves.The second defining feature is sensor fusion. A modern fifth-generation aircraft does not feed a pilot separate streams of radar, infrared, targeting pod and electronic surveillance data. Instead, onboard computers merge all sensor inputs — from the aircraft itself and from external assets such as AWACS, satellites or friendly fighters — into one single tactical picture. Pilots no longer interpret dials; they see the entire battlespace as if viewed from above.The third layer is network-centric warfare. Fifth-generation fighters are not lone hunters. They are nodes in a digital combat mesh, sharing encrypted data silently through low-probability-intercept links. An enemy aircraft detected by one jet can be targeted by another. A missile launched by a ground battery can be guided by the data uplink of an aircraft hundreds of kilometres away. This ability to fight as a distributed swarm rather than as isolated aircraft fundamentally reshapes air power.Advanced avionics and electronic warfare complete the definition. A fifth-generation jet can jam enemy radars, spoof missile seekers, absorb electromagnetic signals for tracking, and identify threats passively without using its own radar. And unlike legacy platforms, which improve only with major hardware refits, fifth-generation jets evolve through software. Each system upgrade can expand detection range, add weapons integration, enhance stealth performance, and reconfigure threat libraries without redesigning the airframe.True fifth-generation capability, therefore, is not just stealth or thrust — it is stealth + fusion + networking + EW dominance + software-driven evolution. Only a few nations have achieved it at scale. The United States leads with the F-22 and F-35, China fields the J-20, and Russia’s Su-57 is still maturing. Others, from Japan and South Korea to India and Europe, are now racing toward sixth-generation development.For United States, selling a fighter jet — especially one as tightly controlled and technologically dense as the F-35 — is never just an arms deal. It is foreign policy with wings. Fighter exports form the backbone of long-term military partnerships, binding nations to American logistics chains, software ecosystems, training infrastructure and, by extension, strategic alignment. Unlike traditional defence sales that end at delivery, fifth-generation platforms create decades-long dependence through updates, maintenance and weapons integration cycles. In practice, a country purchasing an American fighter is not just buying an aircraft — it is entering a relationship.Washington has mastered this form of influence. Nations that operate US platforms rely on American training academies, spare-parts pipelines, engine overhaul depots, weapons testing facilities and encrypted mission-data updates. Every missile added, every software patch authorised, every radar mode unlocked passes through Washington. This system of controlled access means jets double as diplomatic leverage — a partner aligned with US interests receives faster upgrades, deeper integration, and next-generation weapons; one that defies US strategic preferences risks delays, sanctions or removal from programmes entirely.Turkey stands as a pivotal example. Once a full partner in the F-35 programme, it was expelled after purchasing Russia’s S-400 missile system, losing aircraft access, industrial participation and billions in future revenue. The message was clear: ownership is conditional, and alignment is monitored continuously. In West Asia, the dynamic is even sharper. While Israel receives the most advanced F-35 variant with unrestricted modification rights, Saudi Arabia and the UAE face conditional pathways shaped by politics, security guarantees and trust evaluations. The aircraft has become a reward in geopolitical negotiation — allocated not just by purchase capacity, but by reliability as an ally.Washington also uses fighter jet access to shape regional balance. When Russia grows more assertive in Europe, Nato states receive accelerated F-35 deliveries. When China expands its footprint in the Pacific, Japan, South Korea and Australia acquire larger fleets. Where deterrence is needed, jets are not merely sold — they are stationed, forward-deployed and network-integrated. Air power becomes a diplomatic signal: a squadron represents intent; a fleet represents alignment.The possible sale of American F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia has triggered concern within US defence circles, mainly over fears that sensitive technology could slip into the hands of China or Pakistan.A New York Times report, citing a Defense Intelligence Agency brief, outlined concerns that China could eventually access stealth-signature, electronic warfare and radar-absorption modelling if Saudi Arabia imported F-35s into an environment where Chinese contractors provide network infrastructure or defence systems integration. Fifth-generation technology is not just metal and avionics — it is algorithms, mission-data files, sensor-fusion logic, heat-signature shaping and software-defined radar behaviour. Modern aircraft intelligence can be compromised by observing emissions, not stealing hardware.The risk is amplified by how the F-35 works. Its stealth coating chemistry, radar-cross-section shaping and EW system profiles are jealously guarded secrets. Even partial exposure — radar testing from different angles, heat-signature mapping during take-off, or electromagnetic sniffing during exercises — could help adversaries develop counter-stealth solutions. A single compromised maintenance facility, a breached digital-link terminal or a shared runway environment can generate exploitable telemetry.Pakistan emerges as a secondary risk vector. Though Saudi Arabia would not directly transfer Western equipment to Islamabad, support personnel, training officers, or data exposure through joint exercises could indirectly benefit Pakistan’s China-aligned aviation programmes, including development of the J-20 and future stealth derivatives. Washington’s caution reflects precedent: Pakistan received F-16s under strict conditions, and even those platforms faced upgrade restrictions over decade-long concerns of technology diversion to China.This is why, even if Riyadh eventually receives the aircraft, officials quoted by Reuters and defence analysts note the jets would almost certainly be a restricted configuration — without Israel-level electronic warfare autonomy, without independent modification rights, and likely without access to the AIM-260 JATM, the most sensitive next-generation air-combat missile. The architecture would be export-sanitised because leakage is difficult to reverse.US officials say the sale is still under review, and any final agreement will require a detailed security assessment. For now, Washington is weighing two priorities — strengthening ties with Saudi Arabia, and ensuring the F-35’s sensitive technology does not reach rival powers.Fifth-generation fighters remain the rarest and most strategically valuable aircraft in the world — and today, only a handful of nations operate them at scale. At the centre of this landscape is the American F-35, the only fifth-gen platform deployed across multiple continents, services and alliances.The United States leads the field, operating all three variants — Air Force (F-35A), Marine Corps STOVL (F-35B) and Navy carrier-based (F-35C). The jet is now the backbone of Western air power and has been adopted or ordered across Europe, including by the United Kingdom, Italy, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Finland. In the Indo-Pacific, Japan, South Korea and Australia have emerged as major F-35 operators, a deployment pattern closely aligned with Washington’s broader strategy to deter Chinese expansion.Israel became the first operator in West Asia and remains the only regional user to have deployed the F-35 in real combat missions, benefiting from exceptional access, early delivery and custom integration rights.Outside the US-led ecosystem, fifth-generation efforts are smaller and far more limited. China’s J-20 is the most advanced non-Western platform currently in service, designed primarily for long-range interception and air-superiority missions, with an eye on US surveillance aircraft and refuelling tankers in the Pacific. Beijing is also developing a second stealth jet — the FC-31/J-35 — expected to serve aboard future carrier groups.Russia fields the Su-57, but in small numbers, constrained by sanctions, funding pressures and production inefficiencies. While technologically capable in manoeuvrability and close-combat performance, the fleet remains too small to shift global balance in the near term.A few nations are developing future systems — Japan’s F-X, the UK-Italy-Japan Tempest programme, Europe’s FCAS, and India’s AMCA — yet none have reached operational maturity.As of now, the global fifth-generation landscape is essentially a three-pole arena:Until the next generation arrives, the F-35 remains the benchmark — and the only stealth fighter shaping alliances across the world.One of the least visible but most powerful aspects of the F-35 programme is software control. Modern aircraft are software-defined machines. Their flight characteristics, radar modes, electronic warfare responses, weapons employment envelopes and threat libraries are all governed by lines of code. In previous generations, once an aircraft was exported, the buyer had considerable freedom to alter and integrate systems. The F-16 could be rewired and retrofitted domestically, and several countries built their own versions or added indigenous weapons.The F-35 is different. Core mission software, electronic warfare libraries, and threat-identification files are not transferred outright; they are licensed and regularly updated via US-approved channels. This means that Washington retains decisive influence over how far and how fast an F-35 operator can expand its capabilities. Upgrades can be slowed, withheld or tailored. Certain weapons or radar modes can be restricted. In extreme cases, the flow of support and spare parts can be cut altogether.Turkey’s experience offers a case study. After Ankara took delivery of Russia’s S-400 air defence system, the US government removed Turkey from the F-35 consortium, halted planned deliveries and shifted production work away from Turkish firms. In effect, the programme was used not only as a supply contract but as an instrument of sanction. For potential buyers such as Saudi Arabia or the UAE, the message is clear: access to the F-35 comes with expectations about broader strategic alignment, and divergence carries costs.Even among close partners, Washington carefully calibrates the level of capability it provides through the F-35. This is partly driven by the legal requirement to maintain Israel’s qualitative military edge in West Asia, and partly by a broader desire to prevent sensitive technology from falling into hostile hands or being reverse-engineered.In practice, this means that not all F-35 operators receive the same radar modes, electronic warfare options or weapons integration at the same time. Highly sensitive systems such as next-generation air-to-air missiles, advanced stand-off weapons and cutting-edge jamming suites may be offered only to a small subset of trusted allies, or delayed until Washington is confident that the regional balance will not be destabilised.There is also a structural interest in maintaining dependence. If every country had identical capabilities and full control over their F-35 software environment, the leverage that comes from upgrade control would diminish. For the United States, the ability to say “not yet” or “not this particular weapon” is part of how it shapes the behaviour of even close partners. This sometimes generates friction: air forces that see themselves as front-line contributors to coalition operations may resent being held back from the latest configurations. But from Washington’s perspective, the risks of over-sharing are high, particularly in a world where cyber espionage and covert technical cooperation blur the lines of trust.Comparisons between the F-35 and Russia’s Su-57 are often framed in symbolic terms: two rival fifth-generation fighters, representing two competing geopolitical blocs. Yet in practical terms, the two aircraft inhabit different worlds.The F-35 is more numerous by an order of magnitude. Global F-35 deliveries have crossed the four-figure mark and are still rising, with long-term projections of more than 3,000 aircraft over the life of the programme. The Su-57, by contrast, is present only in small numbers, with production hampered by sanctions, industrial constraints and budgetary pressures. This matters because air power, especially in prolonged conflicts, depends not just on the quality of individual aircraft but on the ability to sustain and replace losses.Stealth and networking also separate the two platforms. The Su-57 incorporates stealth features, but open-source assessments suggest that its radar cross-section reduction is inferior to Western designs, particularly from the rear and at certain frequencies. Coating durability, nozzle shaping and panel fit all contribute. The F-35, drawing on decades of US work on the F-117, B-2 and F-22, is widely assessed to have a lower signature and more mature low-observable maintenance regime.More fundamentally, the F-35 is integrated into a wider Western network of satellites, ground stations, AWACS and datalinked assets. The Su-57 operates primarily within Russia’s own air defence and command infrastructure, which does not have the same global reach or the same level of coalition interoperability. In a beyond-visual-range engagement, the ability of a fighter to draw on offboard sensors can be as important as its onboard performance. On that metric, the F-35’s ecosystem gives it a significant advantage.If stealth is the body of the F-35’s advantage, the satellite-networked combat system that surrounds it is the mind. The jet is deeply integrated into secure satellite communication networks that relay encrypted tactical information from across a theatre and beyond. These links allow the F-35 to receive target coordinates and threat data from sources hundreds or even thousands of kilometres away, including space-based sensors, maritime platforms and airborne early warning aircraft.Because it can rely on this stream of external information, the F-35 does not need to use its own radar aggressively to build a picture of the battlespace. Its passive sensors — infrared cameras, electronic support measures and distributed aperture systems — detect emissions from enemy radars, missiles and aircraft. The mission computer fuses these inputs with offboard data, presenting the pilot with a coherent, real-time picture. In a radar-saturated environment such as the Taiwan Strait or Eastern Europe, this allows the F-35 to remain electronically quiet while still operating with full awareness.This networked approach changes how air campaigns are planned. A formation of F-35s can act as forward sensors for other aircraft or missile systems, passing back targeting data without ever exposing themselves. They can launch weapons cued by remote sources or guide munitions fired by other platforms. Rather than thinking of each jet as a discrete combatant, planners increasingly view them as nodes in a mesh network.For countries that buy the F-35, entry into this network is as significant as acquisition of the aircraft itself. For countries that are denied access, the absence is equally stark. That is why the programme has become not simply a procurement issue but a marker of strategic orientation. It defines who is inside the most advanced Western airpower ecosystem — and who remains outside, watching from a different sky.","The F-35 represents networked warfare, real-time intelligence fusion and precision strike capability. No other defence platform in the modern era has reshaped alliances, altered regional balances of power, or influenced international diplomacy the way the F- 35 has. Israel has opposed the proposed Saudi sale, warning that it could erode Israel’s air superiority in the region.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125624202,imgsize-50984,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-ai-image.jpg"

Why PewDiePie stopped playing games and how fans reacted online







Felix “PewDiePie” Kjellberg says he has stepped back from playing video games on YouTube. In his paid newsletter, The Kjellberg Mail, the 36-year-old wrote that becoming a father changed how he values time. He said, “Since becoming a dad, everything does get evaluated differently.” He added that if time is short, “I’d rather be doing something else.” Many fans on X reacted quickly after reports and clips about his note spread online.PewDiePie now posts fewer long gaming streams and more videos about life, projects and Japan, where he lives with his wife, Marzia. People say he is in a semi-retired mode for gaming and focusing on family and new hobbies. At the same time, he’s been experimenting with tech, building a powerful home setup to run open-source AI models, which shows his interests have broadened beyond just playing games.Felix told readers he still could play if he wanted, but he chose not to spend hours on one game anymore. He said every hour “has weight now in a way it didn’t before,” meaning family time matters more.That frank note came in late November and made people talk about creators changing priorities as they get older.Fans on X shared their views. One user wrote that PewDiePie had “figured out life” listing family, calm home and new hobbies.Another said they missed his Minecraft series and might rewatch old videos. Some followers suggested he could balance gaming and fatherhood, while others said stepping back is smart when life shifts.These replies show a mix of support and nostalgia from his audience. At the same time, Felix has been building and testing his own AI tools at home.Reports in early November said he set up a strong PC rig and a custom interface to run open-source models, calling the setup a big creative project.That tech work looks like part hobby and part new content and it helps explain why he’s not doing long game runs anymore. Fans who like his tech videos say this new side of Felix still fits his curious, hands-on style.Also Read: CaseOh Blows Up On Twitch After ChatGPT Suggestion, Internet Explodes Over His ‘10 Years Back’ Rant","Felix ""PewDiePie"" Kjellberg says he has stepped back from playing video games on YouTube.

Union day safety advisory









As the nation gets ready to mark its 54th Union Day, excitement is already building on the streets. To help everyone celebrate in a spirited yet safe way, the Ministry of Interior has issued a clear set of guidelines that outline how residents can decorate their vehicles, showcase the UAE flag and join the festivities without putting themselves or others at risk. The instructions aim to protect the holiday atmosphere by preventing behaviour that could disrupt traffic, create hazards or take away from the joy of the occasion.Authorities have confirmed that residents may celebrate on the roads, but only through two approved practices. Drivers are allowed to place stickers related to Union Day and they may display the UAE flag on their vehicles. The ministry emphasised that these measures help maintain order while still giving people room to express national pride.Officials made it clear that any other type of modification or behaviour that affects visibility, distracts drivers or creates safety hazards will not be permitted. The ministry reminded the public that violations can lead to fines and vehicle impoundment, noting that safe conduct during national celebrations is a shared responsibility.The advisory lists several actions that are strictly banned because of the risks they pose to motorists and pedestrians. These include:Authorities stressed that these measures are in place to prevent accidents, avoid traffic disruptions and ensure that celebrations remain safe for everyone.Drivers are urged to cooperate with traffic officers and to avoid risky actions that could endanger themselves or others.The ministry also highlighted the importance of displaying the UAE flag respectfully. Hoisting the flag is considered one of the most meaningful gestures during Eid Al Etihad, but it must follow approved rules. Officials have issued fifteen guidelines that cover the correct colours, proportions, mounting, maintenance and placement of the flag. These rules ensure the national symbol remains clean, visible and treated with the dignity it represents.Residents are encouraged to actively participate in the celebrations while upholding these shared standards. The ministry noted that the goal is not to limit expressions of patriotism but to ensure that celebrations truly reflect respect for the nation’s community values and commitment to public safety, responsibly.With families finalising their weekend plans and public events being prepared across the country, the Ministry of Interior has reminded everyone that joyful celebrations should never compromise safety. Authorities are urging residents to follow approved practices, maintain order on the roads and celebrate with consideration for others.The ministry concluded by reminding the public that non-compliant vehicles will face fines and impoundment, and that cooperation with traffic officers plays a vital role in ensuring a smooth and enjoyable Union Day for all.","UAE Union Day 54 rules explained.

Funded by Zakat: Uniquely, the program’s funding comes primarily from Zakat, the mandatory Islamic charity, ensuring that the support is distributed to those determined to be truly deserving.

A Safety Net with a Ladder: Unlike old welfare systems, this new structure focuses on rehabilitation, training, and employment. The system categorizes beneficiaries and implements empowerment plans to help those able to work transition from reliance on aid to becoming productive contributors to the economy.

Key Timeline: The modern, enhanced program was introduced in 2022, marking a significant upgrade from the previous system.

Check carefully: Re-enter credentials and ensure you selected the correct programme page (الضمان الاجتماعي).

Still stuck: Contact HRSD through the official portal, the ministry’s support channels, or their verified social accounts for help. News outlets repeatedly advise avoiding rumours and relying only on the ministry’s official site for status and payment confirmation.





The Developed Social Security System (الضمان الاجتماعي المطور), known locally as ""Dhaman Al Ijtima'i Al Mutawwar,"" is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's core financial safety net. Overseen by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development (HRSD), this comprehensive program goes beyond simple aid by focusing on both immediate financial support and long-term empowerment.It aims to achieve the goals of Vision 2030 by ensuring that cash support reaches the most vulnerable while simultaneously transitioning recipients toward financial independence.“Ahlīyatuk” refers to the eligibility result for the developed Social Security (الضمان الاجتماعي المطوّر) program administered by Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development (HRSD). The eligibility check tells applicants whether their support request was approved for the current cycle or if further documentation is needed. This is the single monthly status beneficiaries watch to know if they will receive that month’s cash disbursement. The primary goal of the Developed Social Security program is to alleviate poverty and guarantee that eligible families and individuals secure a minimum monthly income for basic needs.Follow these exact steps to see your eligibility quickly:If the eligibility page or button does not appear, it usually means your application has not yet been processed, the Ministry says eligibility reviews are completed before the 9th of each Gregorian month.Applicants should wait until that window closes before checking again.HRSD has a fixed disbursement routine: approved beneficiaries generally receive their social security payment on the 1st day of each Gregorian month. For example, the news guidance confirms the December 2025 payment is scheduled for 1 December 2025; rumors of early payouts are false, the Ministry has said. Use the HRSD payments page to confirm the deposit date and transaction details.A clear, fast eligibility check reduces anxiety for applicants and cuts the spread of false claims about early payments or changed dates.

“Tommy just lost 50% of his supporters with this one move!”

“Nick Fuentes defends extremism abroad while aiming at the wrong targets at home.”

“People are saying the timing of his Israel trip explains everything — and it’s no coincidence.”

“Fuentes is a Qatari-backed spy-op sent to split the movement — wake up!”

“Shouldn’t you be focusing on England instead of picking fights online?”

“He’s part of the very system he claims to fight against.”

“Fuentes has answered the January 6 question countless times — stop trying to paint him as a fed.”

“America has no idea how Islamic communities operate — Tommy needs to get on US podcasts and explain it.”

“Fuentes has no clue what it’s like living near Islamic neighbourhoods — he’s speaking from a bubble.”

“Your constant alignment with Israel is hurting your own cause — this isn’t helping you.”

Tucker Carlson, Nick Fuentes & Trump: Inside the Chain Reaction Splitting Republicans Wide Open





Conservative commentator Tucker Carlson challenged Piers Morgan to say a gay slur on camera while discussing free speech in the United Kingdom.During Wednesday’s episode of The Tucker Carlson Show, the topic arose after Carlson referenced a story from The Daily Mail about Elizabeth Kinney, a 34-year-old woman who was convicted of a hate crime for using the slur against her attacker in text messages. She was fined and sentenced to a 12-month community order.Arguing that “you’re allowed to be homophobic if you want in a free country,” Carlson asked Morgan directly: “Would you say the word on camera?”Morgan, who said he hadn’t heard the story before, replied, “No.”Carlson pressed: “Why? You don’t want to get arrested, do you?” He added provocatively, “Ohhh, because it’s so harmful to people? Is it like gay-bashing? What’s wrong with that?”Morgan said you don’t need to use derogatory language about the LGBTQ community to make a point about women’s rights.Carlson used the word several times saying, “I’m using it because you’re not allowed to because you’re …”“I am allowed to, I just choose not to,” Morgan replied.Carlson defended himself, saying he is not anti-gay and “never has been,” adding: “I can use any word I want. How about this? Let my life, the way that I actually live and treat people, be the testament to my heart. That’s how I feel. And if I’ve mistreated someone, that is a sin.”Morgan interrupted, suggesting Carlson wouldn’t use the word directly to a gay person’s face. Carlson responded: “Not in a mean way. Just like the only people who say the ‘N-word’ are Black. Period.”He added that during his time in TV news, he had been around many gay people who used the word themselves.Carlson, who was fired from Fox News in April 2023, has a history of controversial remarks and conspiracy theories.He previously claimed in his biography, Tucker, by Chadwick Moore, that “being racist is not a crime,” though he acknowledged it might be a moral crime.","Conservative commentator Tucker Carlson challenged Piers Morgan to say a gay slur on camera while discussing free speech in the United Kingdom.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.
