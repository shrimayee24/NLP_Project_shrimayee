Charlie’s Snapchat check raises concerns for Twitch and other streaming platforms





Australia has started enforcing a world-first rule that stops kids under 16 from using major social media and streaming platforms. This includes apps like Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Twitch and other streaming sites. The goal is simple: keep kids safer online. But even before the ban fully takes effect, teens are already finding ways around the system.Some kids are using fake birth dates. Others are testing selfie checks. And in one strange case shared online, users said they uploaded photos of dogs, including a golden retriever, to age-check systems, and the system still approved them as adults. These stories are raising big questions about how strong and reliable these age checks really are, especially for live streaming platforms where kids spend hours watching and chatting.The issue became very real after Guardian Australia reported on a 15-year-old Sydney boy, called Charlie to protect his identity. Last week, Charlie got a message from Snapchat saying he needed to prove his age to keep using the app because of the new ban. Even though his account used an old birth date that made him look over 16, Snapchat still asked for a check.Charlie chose the selfie option. He took a photo of his face, sent it in, and passed.Seconds later, he got a message saying, “Thank you, we won’t bother you any more.” Charlie said he was shocked it worked so easily.Charlie’s mother, Christine, told Guardian Australia she now wants to report her own child’s account. She questioned how a computer system can really tell the difference between a 15-year-old and a 16-year-old. “It just feels like we’re not going to win,” she said, adding she still hopes the new law helps families in the long run.Snapchat later said it has warned the government about how hard it is to fully block under-age users using current technology. A company spokesperson explained that better age checks might work at phone, device or app-store level. Snapchat also said parents can report accounts they believe belong to under-age children.Meanwhile, teens are still active on other platforms. Charlie said he uses Instagram, TikTok and streaming apps but has not been asked to verify his age there yet. That worries experts, because platforms like Twitch and other live streaming sites often have fewer checks and fast-moving chats.In an opinion piece for News Corp, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the ban will not be perfect. But he stressed the message matters. Just like drinking laws, he said, rules still help even if some teens find ways to break them.For now, kids, parents, and tech companies are locked in a game of catch-up, and the ban’s real test is only just beginning.Also Read: Influencer Jeri Wirtz Of Jeri And Mike TikTok Fame Dies At 74 After Nine Year Cancer Fight","Australia has started enforcing a world-first rule that stops kids under 16 from using major social media and streaming platforms.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible.

But I’ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

That’s why I’ll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and it’s the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder

They’ve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

It’s been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.

And now, I’ll be doing the same.

Looking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I won’t break anything (no promises).

Kianni also took a break from her studies so that she could quickly learn everything about the industry they were going to work in, she told Vogue.","Bill Gates has donated his time and experience to his daughter Phoebe's startup, Phia.

AI videos are fooling millions on social media. No one is ready,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ai-videos-are-fooling-millions-on-social-media-no-one-is-ready/articleshow/125876523.cms,"



Videos created with OpenAI's new app Sora show how easily public perceptions can be manipulated by tools that can produce an alternate reality with a series of simple prompts. In the two months since Sora arrived, deceptive videos have surged on X, YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, according to experts who track them. The deluge has raised alarm over a new generation of disinformation and fakes.Most of the major social media companies have policies that require disclosure of AI use and broadly prohibit content intended to deceive. But those guardrails have proved woefully inadequate for the kind of technological leaps OpenAI's tools represent.While many videos are silly memes or fake images of babies and pets, others are meant to stoke the kind of vitriol that often characterises political debate. They have already figured in foreign influence operations. Researchers who have tracked deceptive uses said the onus was now on companies to do more to ensure people know what is real and what isn't.""Could they do better in content moderation for mis- and disinformation? Yes, they're clearly not doing that,"" said Sam Gregory, executive director of Witness, a human rights organisation focused on the threats of technology.""Could they do better in proactively looking for AI-generated information and labelling it? The answer is yes, as well.""The companies behind the AI tools say they are trying to make clear to users what content is generated by computers. Sora and the rival tool offered by Google, called Veo, both embed a visible watermark onto the videos they produce. Sora, for example, puts a ""Sora"" label on each video. Both companies also include invisible metadata, which can be read by a computer, that establishes the origin of each fake. The idea is to inform people that what they are seeing is not real and to give the platforms that feature them the digital signals to automatically detect them.Some platforms are using that technology. YouTube uses Sora's invisible watermark to append a small label indicating that the AI videos were ""altered or synthetic."" ""Viewers increasingly want more transparency about whether the content they're seeing is altered or synthetic,"" said Jack Malon, a YouTube spokesman.People with malicious intent have discovered that it is easy to get around the disclosure rules. Some manipulate the videos to remove the watermarks. Several firms have sprung up offering to remove logos and watermarks.OpenAI said it prohibits deceptive or misleading uses of Sora and takes action against violators of its policies. The company said its app was just one among dozens of similar tools capable of making increasingly lifelike videos - many of which do not employ any safeguards on use. A spokesman for Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said it was not always possible to label every video generated by AI.","Deceptive videos have surged on X, YouTube, Facebook and Instagram. The deluge has raised alarm over a new generation of disinformation and fakes. Most of the major social media companies have policies that require disclosure of AI use and broadly prohibit content intended to deceive.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125876523,imgsize-895297,width-400,resizemode-4/125876523.jpg"
"Watch: Black bear attacks keeper during stage show at Hangzhou Safari Park, viral video triggers safety debate",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/watch-black-bear-attacks-keeper-during-stage-show-at-hangzhou-safari-park-viral-video-triggers-safety-debate/articleshow/125827140.cms,"



A pleasant and peaceful performance at Hangzhou Safari Park in East China’s Zhejiang Province on Saturday turned terrifying when a black bear suddenly attacked its keeper.Several videos are going viral on social media, showing audience members watching as two keepers guided two black bears onto the stage for another round of performance. One bear successfully performed, while the other, nearing the stage, pounced on its keeper and knocked him to the ground, Global News reported.The fallen keeper struggled to escape while nearby staff grabbed chairs and poles to separate the animal. After the bear was pulled away, it lunged at the keeper again, and staff had to use force to separate them.This footage prompted an online debate over whether animal performances should be banned. Other staff immediately intervened and used props to separate the bear from the keeper. Multiple social media users posted videos of the incident recorded during the bears’ show.The park explained that the incident occurred as the keeper was carrying a large bag of carrots and apples; the bear saw the bag, became excited, and pounced on the keeper in an attempt to get the food, according to the notice. The notice also stated that the keeper said the incident reminded him to be more careful in dealings with the bear in the future.The official social media account of Hangzhou Safari Park posted a notice on Saturday stating that neither the keeper nor the bear was injured.One user, Momo, on the China's social media platform commented, “Safety must be a priority, and we should have respect for animals. Never think of them as cute and docile, or that we can control them.”Another user, Zero Geqian Qianqian, also emphasised the need to focus on safety. Many others have called for the cancellation of animal performances. A user named “Don’t Call Me Ma Ma Ma” asked, “When will animal performances be canceled? Isn’t it in animals’ nature to be food-driven and protective of their food?”Some users expressed sympathy for the bear. A user named “The Girl is Out, I’m at Home” said, “A small bear is like a little baby. How could we make it perform? If it has apples, let it eat! If it were your child, would you make it perform first and then eat? If it’s hungry, then let it perform how to eat, it would be happier, the keeper and the bear would be more harmonious, and the audience would still enjoy it.”On the X also, several users commented on the video. One of the user said, ""I see why the Russians train with them 🤣🤣🤣 that bear is a professional grappler.""Another said, ""Maybe if we didn't lock these animals up for our own amusement they wouldn't attack people.""After the video of the bear attack went viral online and sparked debate, the park released a follow-up video showing that the bear and the keeper have since “reconciled.” While feeding the black bear carrots, the keeper gently petted its head and said, “If you want carrots, why did you snatch mine? [Even if you didn’t], I’ll still give you some.” The black bear stood calmly and ate peacefully, displaying a gentle demeanour.",A black bear suddenly attacked its keeper at Hangzhou Safari Park in East China's Zhejiang Province on Saturday.

Day 1 Abu Dhabi’s Bridge Summit

Idris Elba empowering Africa

$2.8 trillion revolution

‘Leapfrog’ advantage





Abu Dhabi’s BRIDGE Summit opened today (Dec 8, 2025), bringing together creators, platforms, investors and stars to map how AI, creators and global storytelling will reshape media. The three-day event mixes headliner keynotes, hands-on sessions and dealmaking, and the tone is unapologetically ambitious.The Bridge Summit 2025 officially kicked off today at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC), immediately setting a bold tone for the future of global media. Running for three days, the event has attracted a massive convergence of over 60,000 creatives, media specialists, artists, investors, and entrepreneurs.The scale is truly global, with more than 400 speakers, including policymakers and innovation leaders, and attendees from 182 countries.Organizers emphasized that the summit is designed to be the global industry’s new home, a dedicated space for forging high-value partnerships, developing production ecosystems, and exchanging expertise. As stated in the evocative opening film, the message is clear: ""Abu Dhabi is not looking toward the future; it is building it.""A major highlight was the panel featuring Hollywood superstar Idris Elba, who stated he views his own identity as a ""bridge"" between his heritage, the stories he tells, and global audiences. His core mission is to empower African creators and rewrite the continent's global narrative, which has long suffered from misrepresentation.Elba identified a critical issue: many African creators who achieve viral success are blocked from receiving earnings by banking restrictions and digital barriers. To solve this practical problem, he created Akunna (named after his middle name), a platform centered around the Akunna Wallet designed to ensure creators can actually be paid for their work.The opening sessions underscored the sheer economic power of the sector, noting that global media and entertainment generated over $2.8 trillion last year. The line between traditional creative fields is rapidly blurring; today, musicians are becoming developers, and filmmakers are building immersive digital worlds. Key discussions centered on technology, revealing that nearly 70% of content creators are already utilizing AI tools in their work.Speakers explored AI's promise for efficiency and scaling creativity, but also highlighted the associated risks to integrity, authorship, and truth. The consensus was that while AI is a powerful tool, the priority must be establishing frameworks to guide its ethical use and rebuild trust in an age of deepfakes and misinformation.Elba stressed that Africa has a unique advantage: the ability to ""leapfrog"" old infrastructure and build entirely new creative systems, citing the global success of Afrobeats as powerful proof. He argued that the potential for African gaming and fantasy is immense because it operates on a ""blank canvas.""However, he sharply criticized the lack of governmental support, pointing out that some African nations still do not have a dedicated film policy. His message to policymakers was direct: if you want a healthy creative ecosystem, you need infrastructure, distribution, and protection, not just conversation.He concluded that while AI is not the enemy, ""actual intelligence is more powerful than artificial intelligence,"" and requires strong frameworks to maintain authentic human creativity.Beyond panels, BRIDGE is a marketplace: organisers expect the summit to catalyse MoUs, studio deals and investment into production hubs and creative platforms. Abu Dhabi’s push to host the event signals a strategic shift, the emirate wants to be a media-tech crossroads that connects capital, talent and festivals.","The Bridge Summit 2025 officially kicked off today at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC) The event has attracted a massive convergence of over 60,000 creatives, media specialists, artists, investors, and entrepreneurs.

Madinah’s Taibah University action

Why this happened?

Advice for students and staff

What is Blackboard?





The academic routine at Taibah University in Madinah, Saudi Arabia , saw a sudden, mandatory shift this week, prioritizing the safety of its community over traditional classroom attendance. Taibah’s notice cites National Center of Meteorology reports as the reason for the suspension; students were directed to Blackboard for remote study instructions. The university announced the suspension of all in-person classes across its extensive network of campuses, immediately transitioning to a fully digital learning environment.The suspension of physical attendance applied comprehensively to the university’s main campus in Madinah and all of its subsidiary branches located throughout the wider Madinah region. This decision was specifically implemented for Monday, December 8, 2025. To ensure educational continuity without delay, all scheduled lessons and lectures were immediately converted to a distance learning format.The university confirmed that instruction would be conducted entirely through the established Blackboard system. This switch demonstrated the institution’s prepared infrastructure for managing disruptive events while upholding academic obligations.The critical reason behind the rapid change was a severe weather warning issued by the national meteorological body. The university’s announcement, reported by Al-Riaydh newspaper, was made following official reports from the National Center of Meteorology (NCM).These reports indicated the high probability of heavy rainfall across the area, posing a significant risk to commuters and campus safety. The primary motivation for the suspension, confirmed by university officials, was the deep concern for the safety of both students and administrative staff and faculty. The university affirmed that this pre-emptive step was taken in coordination with all relevant specialized authorities tasked with managing regional weather crises.Students and faculty should: (1) log into Blackboard before scheduled class times to confirm session links and any revised assessment arrangements; (2) follow Taibah University’s official social channels and the university portal for real-time notices; and (3) avoid travel to campus while alerts are active. The university’s message stresses that classes remain in session remotely, so attendance and coursework expectations continue as normal unless otherwise announced.Blackboard is Taibah University’s official online learning platform used to deliver classes, assignments, exams and course materials remotely. When in-person classes are suspended, Blackboard becomes the main way for students and teachers to continue lessons without interruption.Students can access Blackboard through the university portal or the mobile app. After logging in with their university ID, they can open each course page to find live class links, lecture recordings, assignments and announcements. Teachers may also upload new schedules or send messages about any changes. Students should keep notifications enabled and check their course dashboards regularly, especially during weather-related closures.The decision by Taibah University reflects a broader pattern of instability in the region's weather conditions. Contextual reports, including the Saudi Gazette, confirmed that the NCM had warned of a widespread rainy spell commencing around this time, affecting not only Madinah but also neighboring regions like the Makkah highlands.","Taibah University in Madinah, Saudi Arabia, suspended all in-person classes this week.

Australia won't penalise parents or kids for accessing social media...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/australia-wont-penalise-parents-or-kids-for-accessing-social-media-/articleshow/125876869.cms,"...But Cos Can Be Fined Up To A$50M

What social media services are covered by the law?

How will the platforms verify users' age?

What if you're not logged in to a social media account?

What do the companies say?

What are the penalties?





There are an estimated 440,000 Australian teens, ages 13 to 15, on Snapchat. On Instagram, 350,000 of that age group are active users, and on TikTok, 200,000. Even Facebook - not exactly squarely in the Gen Alpha zeitgeist - reportedly has 150,000. On Wednesday, those numbers drastically changed under a landmark law that requires users in Australia to be at least 16 to have accounts on social media platforms. Here is how the law is expected to work.The platforms currently affected by the law are Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, Twitch, X and YouTube. Other services widely used by young teens were excluded because Australia's eSafety commissioner deemed them to be primarily for messaging or gaming, including: Discord, Messenger, Pinterest, Roblox, WhatsApp and YouTube Kids. Regulators say they will continue to review the services.The burden is on the respective tech companies to deactivate younger users by utilising an array of age estimation and verification technologies at their disposal, in addition to the user's self-reported age. Regulators have said the companies may rely on factors like how long the account has been active; whether it interacts with other underage users; facial or voice analysis; or activity patterns consistent with school hours.Phones are already banned in all Australian schools. The law says that the platforms cannot require users to provide govt identification as the only option to verify their age, a response to privacy concerns.Underage users will continue to be able to access posts or videos that are openly available to those without an account. Even so, govt says barring kids from having accounts will spare them from the apps' most harmful design features, like the algorithms or push notifications that are central to their addictive potential.Tech companies have criticised the law as being poorly designed, saying teens will no longer benefit from features that they have been introducing to make their platforms a safer place, like parental controls or teen-specific accounts.There are no punishments for children or parents who continue to access social media. The companies, however, can face fines up to 50m Australian dollars ($33m) for not taking steps to prevent users younger than 16 from having accounts on their platforms.","Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, Twitch, X and YouTube are covered by the law.

2025 Words of the Year — Explained Word Meaning Slop Low-quality, mass-produced AI content that floods the internet — from fake videos and automated articles to meaningless posts that clog feeds and dilute real information. Rage bait Content designed to provoke anger and outrage on purpose. Outrage is used to drive clicks, shares, and algorithmic reach rather than to inform or enlighten. Parasocial One-sided emotional relationships people form with influencers, celebrities or even AI personalities — it feels like connection, but it’s not mutual. 6-7 A viral meme phrase with no fixed meaning — an inside joke used playfully by younger internet users, symbolising absurd humour and the escape value of nonsense.

Are we helpless?







NEW DELHI: Once upon a time, new words made the world feel larger. They came from science, from art, from discovery. They named planets, ideas, emotions. They made language feel like progress.In 2025, the words made language feel like a warning.This year’s 'Words of the Year' did not arrive gently. They arrived with an edge:, and the inexplicably viral. These are not terms that celebrate where we are going. They describe what we are drowning in — low-quality content, manufactured outrage, artificial closeness and meme culture untethered from meaning.The dictionary, it turns out, has become something of a diary. And what it recorded this year was not confidence, but confusion.The Economist crowned 'slop' its word of the year — a term that has travelled from describing muddy liquid in the 1400s to a modern label for low-quality artificial content clogging the internet. Oxford University Press chose 'rage bait', defined as digital content engineered to provoke outrage for clicks. The Cambridge Dictionary selected 'parasocial', pointing to our one-sided emotional bonds with influencers or celebrities.And then, in a wonderfully surreal flourish, Dictionary.com honoured '6-7', a viral yet essentially meaningless meme birthed from TikTok, basketball edits, and internet in-jokes.Put together, these words do not describe a stable world. They describe a noisy one. A polluted one. A world where content multiplies endlessly, meaning thins out, and emotional manipulation is an industry in itself.If words are cultural weather reports, 2025’s forecast is thick with fog.The Economist’s choice 'slop' has a deliberately unglamorous sound. It conjures soggy food, leftovers, and careless mixing. That’s exactly the point.Slop is what happens when content is generated faster than it can be consumed, filtered, or valued. It is AI-written health advice, fake videos with synthetic voices, bot-generated opinions, low-effort listicles, and endless motivational quotes with no author and no soul. It is not always wrong; it is often just hollow.What makes slop different from spam or clickbait is scale.The industrialisation of content via artificial intelligence has tilted the internet from being a library to being a landfill. Anyone can produce thousands of articles, images, and videos in hours. Feeds no longer feel curated; they feel flooded.Once, publishing implied effort. Today, it implies automation. The old internet rewarded originality. The new one requires filtration. Users must develop instincts not only for truth and falsehood, but for value and worthlessness.“Slop” is the first mainstream term that openly acknowledges something internet users have felt for years: that the digital experience itself has become diluted.Yet the Economist argues that slop may indirectly rescue journalism. When everything feels unreliable, people return to the reliable. When Google results are flooded by ghost-written pages, a trusted newspaper feels like shelter. When social media becomes a slurry of recycled sentiments, real reporting regains flavour.In an ugly way, slop may make quality visible again — by contrast.If 'slop' describes the content flood, 'rage bait' describes how attention is harvested from it.Oxford’s Word of the Year defines 'rage bait' as content engineered to enrage. These are not posts designed to inform or persuade, but to provoke. Outrage is not an accident of the internet. It is infrastructure.Rage bait thrives on emotional shortcuts:- A headline that distorts.- A video clip taken out of context.- A caption that implies scandal where there is none.- A screenshot stripped of explanation.Anger is the easiest emotion to manufacture. It is fast. It is sticky. It is contagious. Algorithms did not invent outrage — but they weaponised it.And AI has poured petrol on it.Automated systems can now:- Mass-produce inflammatory headlines.- Generate comment wars using bots.- Flood a platform with synthetic disagreement.- Fabricate voices, arguments, faces.- Outrage has become programmable.The danger is not just misinformation but emotional exhaustion. A user locked in an environment of constant anger is always alert, always reactive, and rarely reflective.Rage bait doesn’t persuade. It polarises. Over time, it doesn’t make people ignorant — it makes them tired. And tired people stop verifying. They share first. They question later.Cambridge Dictionary’s word, 'parasocial,' feels gentler than 'slop' or 'rage bait' — but it is no less revealing.A parasocial relationship is a psychological phenomenon where one person forms a bond with someone who does not know they exist. Originally used to describe TV presenters and celebrities, the term has exploded in usage alongside influencers and live-streamers.In the age of stories, streams, vlogs and podcasts, public figures do not feel distant anymore. They eat on camera. Cry on camera. Argue with partners. Reveal insecurities. Celebrate birthdays.You know their dog’s name. But they don’t know yours...Parasocial bonds are not unhealthy by default. Humans have always attached themselves to fictional heroes and public figures. But social platforms intensify the illusion of closeness. Interaction mimics friendship. Likes resemble affirmation. Replies feel like intimacy.AI complicates this further. With chatbots, virtual companions, and AI-generated personalities, parasocial no longer refers only to celebrities. It now includes synthetic relationships.Loneliness now has a user interface. 'Parasocial' being Word of the Year signals an uncomfortable fact: social connection is becoming engineered.And we are accepting it.Dictionary.com’s word: '6-7' is nothing but a meme.'6-7' has no agreed meaning. It is joke, reference, chant and aesthetic combined. It exists because the internet liked how it sounded. It spread because it made no sense. It endured because it didn’t need to.This might be the most truthful Word of the Year of them all.In an age of information overload, nonsense feels lighter. In a world anxiously analysing AI risks, war news, and climate fear — inside jokes become oxygen. '6-7' is absurdist comfort.Where 'rage bait' feeds anger, memes feed relief. Not everything viral needs logic. In fact, meaninglessness is sometimes the appeal. If 'rage bait' weaponises emotion, memes sedate it. And perhaps both are forms of coping.Each of these 'Words of the Year' tells a story. Together, they tell one larger story.2025 is the year:- We realised content had stopped meaning quality (slop).- We understood outrage had become an industry (rage bait).- We admitted relationships were becoming synthetic (parasocial).- And we escaped into nonsense when reality felt heavy (6-7).This is not simply an 'AI story.' It is a human one. AI is the accelerator. But the emotions are ours.We built machines that mimic intelligence faster than we built systems that protect attention. We flooded platforms before we built dams. We created speed before we created moderation.The result is a cognitive traffic jam. Too many words. Too many images. Too much reaction. Too little silence.In 2024, words such asandhighlighted a world grappling with identity, self-image and the mental consequences of social media overload.'Brain rot' captured the sense of mental exhaustion from trivial content, 'manifest' spoke to a surge in self-help and self-empowerment vibes, 'demure' reflected a social-media driven rethinking of modesty and style — and 'kakistocracy' voiced political anxieties during an unstable global moment.Now in 2025, the lexicon has shifted — but the underlying anxieties remain sharper. Words like 'slop' and 'rage bait' point less to image, identity or spirituality — and more to degradation, manipulation and existential overload. Slop describes a flood of low-quality, AI-driven content.While 2024’s words loosely traced a generation redefining style, self-belief and politics, 2025’s terms reflect a deeper fatigue — a sense that the internet isn’t just changing culture, but eroding meaning itself.Not necessarily.Language doesn’t just record change. It enables resistance. The moment we name a phenomenon, we weaken it. Calling something 'rage bait' is an act of refusal. Calling something 'slop' is a rejection of mediocrity. Recognising 'parasocial' bonds is emotional self-defence. Laughing at '6-7' is a reminder that absurdity still belongs to humans.The 'Words of the Year' are no longer just linguistic curiosities. They are cultural alarms.When dictionaries start ranking nonsense, anger, artificial closeness and digital pollution, they are not tracking how we speak. They are tracking how we live.2025 did not give us a vocabulary of progress. It handed us a glossary of exhaustion. The internet was once a tool. This year, it felt like a force — one that reshaped attention, rewired relationships and monetised emotion.If we continue scrolling without scepticism, sharing without reflection and reacting without reading, then slop will thicken, rage will deepen and algorithms will do our thinking for us.Humans still choose what goes viral.

Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has completed 595 new public bus passenger shelters across key locations, bringing the wider shelter project to about 89% completion of the target 762 units. The RTA says the rollout forms part of a long-term plan to modernise street-level public transport infrastructure and make waiting for buses more comfortable and reliable for everyone.The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in Dubai has reached a major milestone in modernizing the city’s public transport network, rolling out hundreds of state-of-the-art bus shelters. This ambitious initiative aims to construct a total of 762 sophisticated shelters by the end of 2025.To date, the project is near completion, with 595 shelters already installed, marking a substantial 89% overall progress. This upgrade is far more than an aesthetic facelift; it’s a pivotal step toward cultivating an integrated urban environment that supports sustainability and enhances the daily lives of residents and visitors.The strategic importance of this project is immense, as the bus network currently serves over 192 million passengers annually.To maximize efficiency and ridership, the RTA carefully selected locations based on future demand, high population density, and the need for integration with other ""soft mobility"" options. Many of the new stops are major hubs, designed to handle high volumes of traffic, with certain locations serving more than ten bus routes per shelter.The new shelters boast a sleek, contemporary aesthetic that perfectly complements Dubai’s modern architectural landscape. However, the true transformation lies in the user-friendly technology and comfort features integrated into the design.For stops classified as Primary Shelters (serving over 750 passengers daily), the RTA provides top-tier amenities:The RTA categorizes all 762 shelters into four tiers based on passenger volume to ensure appropriate amenity levels at every stop:In a move showcasing Dubai's focus on future technology, the RTA is also exploring the use of 3D printing technology for the construction of some shelters on a trial basis, blending functionality with cutting-edge innovation.H.E. Mattar Al Tayer, Director General and Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors of the RTA, emphasized the project's greater role, stating: “The new shelters represent a pivotal step in RTA's efforts to develop an integrated urban environment that encourages residents and visitors to use public transport, improves quality of life, and promotes comfort and well-being.”He added that ensuring the shelters combine modern design with services that guarantee a better mobility experience is key to reinforcing public confidence in the network and supporting long-term sustainability objectives, including emissions reduction.The initiative aligns with Dubai’s broader vision for inclusive urban development. The design of every new shelter is fully compliant with the Dubai Universal Design Code, ensuring complete accessibility for all community members. This focus includes dedicated, comfortable spaces specifically tailored for wheelchair users (People of Determination).This commitment to inclusivity supports the ""My Community … A City for Everyone"" initiative, launched by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai.",Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has completed 595 new public bus passenger shelters across key locations.

One step renewal

Citizen driven design

Faster and efficient

Part of zero bureaucracy





In a major step towards seamless government services, the UAE has introduced a unified system that allows Emirati citizens to renew their passports and Emirates ID cards in a single, integrated process. The move, part of the “Zero Bureaucracy” initiative, promises to cut processing times, reduce administrative hurdles, and transform the way citizens manage key identity documents.The Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has launched a smart service enabling citizens to renew both passports and Emirates ID cards together. Previously, individuals had to complete separate applications for each document, navigate different forms, and make multiple payments. The new system consolidates all these steps into one seamless process via the UAEICP smart application.Citizens whose passports have expired and whose Emirates ID is due to expire within six months will now see an option to conveniently renew both documents on a single page within the app. The platform also allows users to easily update personal information and photographs without needing to re-enter data multiple times.The integrated renewal service directly addresses public concerns identified during the “Zero Bureaucracy Expo.” Many residents expressed frustration over managing different expiration dates for passports and ID cards, which often caused administrative confusion. By synchronizing the renewal process, the government ensures that citizens no longer have staggered expirations, simplifying document management.Officials highlighted that the system’s development was shaped by citizen input, evolving from a simple service improvement into a comprehensive smart solution. This reflects a broader commitment to responsive governance, where services are designed to meet the real needs of the public.The new unified platform is expected to cut processing times by at least 50 per cent while reducing inquiries and customer calls by around 40 per cent. It supports the national goal of simplifying procedures, improving government responsiveness, and delivering faster, more integrated services.By centralizing the management of all passports and identity documents for an entire family, the application represents a major leap forward in digital government services. The initiative prioritizes efficiency, quality, and tangible impact, leveraging technology and best practices to make citizens’ lives easier with minimal effort.This development forms part of the second phase of the Zero Government Bureaucracy (ZGB) Programme, launched in June by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai. The program aims to establish a world-leading model for government services, emphasizing proactive, user friendly, and fully integrated digital solutions.The unified passport and Emirates ID renewal service exemplifies the UAE government’s ongoing commitment to eliminating unnecessary administrative hurdles and creating a modern, citizen-centric public service environment.","UAE has introduced a unified system that allows Emirati citizens to renew their passports and Emirates ID cards in a single, integrated process.

This new patrol car is not just a high-performance vehicle; it is a global rarity, being one of only seven customized units of its kind in the entire world.The vehicle was specially modified by the German tuning house Mansory, giving it an aggressive yet sophisticated look perfectly suited for the streets of Dubai. The custom upgrades include a full carbon-fibre exterior kit, a sporty front bumper, a prominent rear wing, and custom forged FC.5 wheels.Inside, the cabin features a bespoke interior with premium leather and carbon-fibre trims, reflecting the city’s commitment to high-end excellence.The car’s performance is as impressive as its looks.

This celebration marked a significant milestone: 12 years of the Dubai Police’s luxury patrol fleet.The concept of using supercars for police patrols began in 2013 with the introduction of a Lamborghini, quickly turning the fleet into an international symbol of Dubai's innovative approach to security. Today, the luxury fleet has grown to an impressive 56 high-performance vehicles.The strategic purpose of these vehicles, including the new Ferrari, is not chase or speed, but enhanced visibility and global branding.Brigadier Saeed Al Hajri, Director of the General Department of Criminal Investigation, confirmed that the fleet reflects Dubai Police's commitment to innovation and service excellence.

By positioning these eye-catching cars in high-traffic areas, the police aim to bolster the sense of safety and showcase Dubai’s modern image.The fleet’s community role extends far beyond patrolling. Lieutenant Colonel Muhammad Abdulrahman noted that the patrol cars have participated in 1,184 events over the last three years. Crucially, they are also used to engage with the public on a personal level, having helped fulfil 49 wishes for children between 2023 and 2025, reinforcing the police’s focus on community happiness and positive interaction.","Dubai Police has redefined luxury law enforcement once again by adding a highly customized Ferrari Purosangue Mansory to its world-famous fleet.

How the selection and registration works





New system upgrades and early registration





Quota, oversight, and support









Qatar is gearing up to welcome pilgrims for the Hajj 1447 AH season as the Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs (Awqaf) launches its electronic selection process. Starting December 2, 2025, the Hajj and Umrah Affairs Department will guide shortlisted applicants through a digital system designed to make registration smooth, transparent, and efficient. This initiative also gives operators the ability to plan trips effectively, ensuring top quality services for pilgrims.Pilgrims who are shortlisted will receive an SMS notifying them of their approval. Once notified, they have seven days to complete the registration process with one of the 24 accredited Hajj operators through the official website, www.hajj.gov.qa. Missing this deadline will result in automatic cancellation.During registration, applicants are required to pay an advance of QAR 10,000. This is part of the total Hajj cost, not a separate registration fee, and the final price depends on the services chosen, including accommodation and transportation. Pilgrims must also sign an electronic contract selecting their preferred operator through the online system.The advance payment ensures that applicants are serious about performing Hajj.It also helps operators plan their trips carefully, making sure all arrangements are ready for pilgrims’ arrival. Applicants are encouraged to review the services and costs of each operator, as they may vary in terms of residency, hospitality, and transportation.This year, the electronic system comes with a smoother online payment mechanism, allowing pilgrims to pay comfortably according to the prices set by their chosen operator. Building on the success of previous seasons, early registration is now open, giving operators the chance to finalize contracts and organize trips well in advance.These upgrades aim to provide a seamless pilgrimage experience. Pilgrims can focus on performing Hajj in a calm and organized setting while benefiting from high quality services.Qatar’s quota for this season is set at 4,400 pilgrims. The electronic selection process fully respects this allocation and follows established standards. Awqaf is working closely with the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah in Saudi Arabia, along with other relevant authorities, to ensure the pilgrimage runs smoothly and meets the expectations of Qatar’s pilgrims.For any questions about registration, selection, or services, pilgrims can contact the hotline at 132. The ministry emphasized that these coordinated efforts reflect its commitment to providing an organized, transparent, and fulfilling Hajj experience for all pilgrims from Qatar.","Qatar is gearing up to welcome pilgrims for the Hajj 1447 AH season.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Meet Charlie Javice: Woman who scammed JP Morgan for $175M — but the bank is paying her $142M legal bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meet-charlie-javice-woman-who-scammed-jp-morgan-for-175m-but-the-bank-is-paying-her-142m-legal-bills/articleshow/125369591.cms,"How a startup deal turned into a massive fraud

A conviction that didn’t stop the bills

The controversial expenses

Why JPMorgan cannot simply stop paying

Charlie Javice’s story sounds almost too bizarre to be real: a young fintech founder who tricked JPMorgan into buying her startup for $175 million, ended up convicted of fraud, and is now serving a prison sentence, yet the same company she scammed is still paying more than $142 million for her legal bills, including questionable expenses like luxury hotel upgrades and “cellulite butter. ”Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid. When JPMorgan considered acquiring the startup in 2021, she reportedly presented the bank with millions of supposed student user accounts. Prosecutors later revealed that these numbers had been fabricated, with Javice allegedly hiring a data scientist to generate fake profiles to inflate Frank’s value.JPMorgan completed the acquisition believing Frank had more than four million users, only to discover after the deal that the platform had a tiny fraction of that. The bank alerted authorities, and by 2023 Javice was arrested on federal fraud charges.In March 2025, Javice was convicted of multiple fraud counts and sentenced to more than seven years in prison. But here’s where the story takes an unusual twist: despite defrauding the bank, she is still allowed to bill JPMorgan for her legal defence because of an indemnification clause included in the acquisition agreement.This contractual protection, which is common in startup buyouts, requires JPMorgan to cover certain legal costs for former executives of Frank.As a result, the bank has already paid over $142 million in defence expenses for Javice and her former colleague Olivier Amar.The clause itself is a standard feature in mergers, designed to protect executives from being financially ruined by lawsuits connected to their time at the company. In normal situations, it is meant to ensure fairness and prevent frivolous legal targeting after an acquisition. But in this case, it has trapped JPMorgan in a bizarre obligation: they must keep funding the defence of someone who defrauded them.Had the bank conducted even a simple, early-stage verification of Frank’s user data—such as requesting direct access to the platform’s actual customer records or running a basic audit—this entire dispute could have been avoided. Instead, delayed due diligence and overconfidence in the startup’s claims set the stage for a costly legal mess that continues years after the fraud was uncovered.JPMorgan’s frustration has grown as the legal bills have ballooned. The bank claims the expenses submitted include personal items such as cellulite butter, first-class travel upgrades, and hotel luxuries. Its lawyers argue that the billing records contain “extreme abuses,” including claims for work hours that seem physically impossible.Javice’s spokesperson denies that she personally submitted these questionable charges, stating that her legal team is responsible for all billing decisions.Even though Javice has already been convicted, she is now appealing her case, and the indemnification clause means the bank must continue paying her legal fees unless a court orders otherwise. JPMorgan is currently trying to convince a Delaware judge to halt these payments, arguing that the system is being misused.The saga has become a major lesson in the risks of fast-paced startup acquisitions. JPMorgan’s failure to properly verify Frank’s user base before buying the company has left it entangled in one of the most embarrassing and expensive due diligence failures in recent corporate history.","Charlie Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid.

He likes watching sports, going to his daughters’ dance recitals, and open white shirts, just normal stuff. His favorite candy is the not-very-exciting Butterfinger. If you ask him to be in your YouTube video, he’ll probably do it. He won’t be great in it, but neither will he be horrible,” reads Mohan’s TIME profile.“YouTube today is like a metropolis with lots of interconnected dependencies, and what you do on one street impacts what happens on another street,” says Mohan. “In the early days, it was much more like a village, where lots of the creators knew each other. And I think that if you’re the leader of one vs. the other, you’re forced to think about decisions in maybe a different way.”Mohan is a graduate in electric engineering from Stanford University. He joined Google in 2008. Born in Indiana, US, the executive spent much of his childhood there before relocating to Lucknow with his family in 1985, aged 12.He became YouTube's Chief Product Officer in 2015. He had played pivotal roles in the launch of some of biggest products, including YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium and Shorts.Mohan has also worked with Microsoft and sits on the board of Stitch Fix and genomics and biotechnology company 23andMe. He previously spent nearly six years at DoubleClick, a company Google acquired in 2007, and later served for about eight years as senior vice president of display and video advertising at Google.","Neal Mohan took charge as YouTube CEO in 2023 after his mentor Susan Wojcicki stepped down.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai celebrates new breakthrough in quantum algorithm; Elon Musk replies: ‘Looks like…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-celebrates-new-breakthrough-in-quantum-algorithm-elon-musk-replies-looks-like/articleshow/124754841.cms,"



What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently shared a post on X, formerly Twitter, announcing a new breakthrough in quantum algorithms. “Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage,” Pichai wrote in the post, adding it is “13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers”. Pichai’s post caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk . The tech billionaire replied to Pichai’s post saying “Congrats. Looks like quantum computing is becoming relevant.”Announcing the major breakthrough, Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote:The achievement marks a historic breakthrough in quantum computing. For the first time ever, a quantum computer has performed a complex, verifiable calculation faster than any supercomputer could — about 13,000 times faster. This moment is being called a “verifiable quantum advantage.""Using Google’s Willow quantum chip, researchers ran an advanced algorithm called Quantum Echoes (or OTOC — out-of-order time correlator).This algorithm helps scientists study how information spreads in quantum systems — things like molecules, magnets, or even black holes.The key part: the result was verifiable and repeatable, meaning other quantum computers could confirm it independently.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently shared a post on X, formerly Twitter, announcing a new breakthrough in quantum algorithms.
