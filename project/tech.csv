Two decades of sat data show gradual dip in Uttarakhand hills green cover,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/two-decades-of-sat-data-show-gradual-dip-in-uttarakhand-hills-green-cover/articleshow/128129466.cms,"BENGALURU: Satellites watching the sweep of the Himalayas have begun to read the mountains like a slow-moving diary. Grasslands revive with the seasons, forests deepen in colour, and valley flora shifts its pattern, yet the same images also carry warnings of strain. An analysis of two-decade data of Uttarakhand’s vegetation shows how closely the region responds to climate and how those rhythms are starting to falter.Mountain ecosystems react faster than most landscapes to changes in temperature and rainfall. Rising global surface temperatures and altered precipitation patterns are already influencing plant growth, soil moisture, and snow cover. Scientists say this makes local and long-term monitoring essential if govts are to prepare for floods, droughts, and biodiversity loss.To track these changes, researchers from the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) in Nainital, an autonomous institute under the department of science and technology (DST), worked with Indian and international collaborators using Google Earth Engine, or GEE, a platform that processes large volumes of satellite data.The tool allows scientists to study land degradation, urban growth, dust movement, and temperature trends without the heavy burden of storing raw images.The team examined satellite records from 2001 to 2022 and relied on a widely used indicator called the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The index measures how plants reflect light and provides a simple guide to their health. Low NDVI values point to rock, sand, water, or snow, while higher values signal dense forests, croplands, or wetlands. The researchers also studied the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which performs better in areas with thick biomass.Their findings of the study led by Umesh Dumka from ARIES, published in the journal “Environmental Monitoring and Assessment”, reveal clear seasonal cycles. NDVI and EVI peak after the monsoon when hills turn lush, and fall to their lowest levels before the rains. Monthly and yearly variations follow a familiar pattern, yet the long-term graphs show a gradual decline.The study links this drop to deforestation, expanding agriculture, illegal logging, and rising pollution from towns and industries. Pollution, the researchers note, does not strike evenly. Some pockets suffer heavier damage, adding to the stress created by warming temperatures and erratic rainfall. Such pressures threaten wildlife habitats, river systems, and the livelihoods of millions who depend on the mountains downstream.Using time-series maps generated through GEE, the scientists compared vegetation trends with climate data and applied Pearson’s correlation to understand their relationship. The approach allowed them to pinpoint districts where greenery has weakened most sharply.The authors argue that satellite science can serve as an early-warning system. By identifying vulnerable zones, authorities can plan afforestation, regulate construction, and control emissions before losses become irreversible. The Himalayas, they say, are signalling distress in a language of pixels and numbers. Listening to that message may decide how resilient the region remains in the decades ahead.","Mountain ecosystems react faster than most landscapes to changes in temperature and rainfall.

Apple iPhone 17e price (expected)

Apple is reportedly gearing up to announce the successor to last year’s iPhone 16e. Likely to be called iPhone 17e, the smartphone “is due imminently”, claims Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman in the latest edition of his weekly PowerOn newsletter. “Apple will market the 17e heavily to users in emerging economies and enterprises — two areas the company plans to target aggressively this year with both devices and software,” Gurman writes in the newsletter. He also shared that the phone will come with a few “big changes” that include iPhone 17’s A19 chipset and MagSafe charging, among others.The upcoming iPhone 17e, Gurman says will be powered by the A19 chip that comes with iPhone 17. The A19 offers a modest boost in CPU speed compared to the A18, but most of its improvement is in GPU, thus allowing it to be even better for AI features and gaming.Further, the handset is tipped to get MagSafe charging feature. Another change coming the iPhone 17e is that it may be equipped with Apple’s newest in-house cellular and wireless chips.Korean news outlet The Elec previously reported that the iPhone 17e is expected to feature slimmer display bezels while retaining the iPhone 14-era OLED panel. Other major new features include an 18MP front camera with Center Stage. This camera automatically extends to show everybody in a group selfie, even when you hold the phone vertically.As far as the pricing of the upcoming iPhone 17e is concerned, Gurman says that the company is planning to keep pricing the same as iPhone 16e. To recall, iPhone 16e launched in 2025 with a price tag of $599 or Rs 59,900 in India.","Apple is reportedly gearing up to announce the successor to last year’s iPhone 16e.

Q: How much time should I be dedicating to career cushioning?

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

"As ChatGPT gets ads, starting today, Anthropic's 1000-plus words to explain why what Sam Altman is doing with ChatGPT is wrong",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/as-chatgpt-gets-ads-starting-today-anthropics-1000-plus-words-to-explain-why-what-sam-altman-is-doing-with-chatgpt-is-wrong/articleshow/128142273.cms,"Sam Altman, CEO, OpenAI

Here’s the blog post shared by Anthropic

There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them.

Advertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns, and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry.

But including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.

We want Claude to act unambiguously in our users’ interests. So we’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. Our users won’t see “sponsored” links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude’s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for.

The nature of AI conversations

When people use search engines or social media, they’ve come to expect a mixture of organic and sponsored content. Filtering signal from noise is part of the interaction.

Conversations with AI assistants are meaningfully different. The format is open-ended; users often share context and reveal more than they would in a search query. This openness is part of what makes conversations with AI valuable, but it’s also what makes them susceptible to influence in ways that other digital products are not.

Our analysis of conversations with Claude (conducted in a way that keeps all data private and anonymous) shows that an appreciable portion involve topics that are sensitive or deeply personal—the kinds of conversations you might have with a trusted advisor. Many other uses involve complex software engineering tasks, deep work, or thinking through difficult problems. The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous—and, in many cases, inappropriate.

We still have much to learn about the impact of AI models on the people who use them. Early research suggests both benefits—like people finding support they couldn’t access elsewhere—and risks, including the potential for models to reinforce harmful beliefs in vulnerable users. Introducing advertising incentives at this stage would add another level of complexity. Our understanding of how models translate the goals we set them into specific behaviors is still developing; an ad-based system could therefore have unpredictable results.

Incentive structures

Being genuinely helpful is one of the core principles of Claude’s Constitution, the document that describes our vision for Claude’s character and guides how we train the model. An advertising-based business model would introduce incentives that could work against this principle.

Consider a concrete example. A user mentions they’re having trouble sleeping. An assistant without advertising incentives would explore the various potential causes—stress, environment, habits, and so on—based on what might be most insightful to the user. An ad-supported assistant has an additional consideration: whether the conversation presents an opportunity to make a transaction. These objectives may often align—but not always. And, unlike a list of search results, ads that influence a model’s responses may make it difficult to tell whether a given recommendation comes with a commercial motive or not. Users shouldn’t have to second-guess whether an AI is genuinely helping them or subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable.

Even ads that don’t directly influence an AI model’s responses and instead appear separately within the chat window would compromise what we want Claude to be: a clear space to think and work. Such ads would also introduce an incentive to optimize for engagement—for the amount of time people spend using Claude and how often they return. These metrics aren’t necessarily aligned with being genuinely helpful. The most useful AI interaction might be a short one, or one that resolves the user’s request without prompting further conversation.

We recognize that not all advertising implementations are equivalent. More transparent or opt-in approaches—where users explicitly choose to see sponsored content—might avoid some of the concerns outlined above. But the history of ad-supported products suggests that advertising incentives, once introduced, tend to expand over time as they become integrated into revenue targets and product development, blurring boundaries that were once more clear-cut. We’ve chosen not to introduce these dynamics into Claude.

Our approach

Anthropic is focused on businesses, developers, and helping our users flourish. Our business model is straightforward: we generate revenue through enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions, and we reinvest that revenue into improving Claude for our users. This is a choice with tradeoffs, and we respect that other AI companies might reasonably reach different conclusions.

Expanding access to Claude is central to our public benefit mission, and we want to do it without selling our users’ attention or data to advertisers. To that end, we’ve brought AI tools and training to educators in over 60 countries, begun national AI education pilots with multiple governments, and made Claude available to nonprofits at a significant discount. We continue to invest in our smaller models so that our free offering remains at the frontier of intelligence, and we may consider lower-cost subscription tiers and regional pricing where there is clear demand for it. Should we need to revisit this approach, we’ll be transparent about our reasons for doing so.

Supporting commerce

AI will increasingly interact with commerce, and we look forward to supporting this in ways that help our users. We’re particularly interested in the potential of agentic commerce, where Claude acts on a user’s behalf to handle a purchase or booking end to end. And we’ll continue to build features that enable our users to find, compare, or buy products, connect with businesses, and more—when they choose to do so.

We’re also exploring more ways to make Claude a focused space to be at your most productive. Users can already connect third-party tools they use for work—like Figma, Asana, and Canva—and interact with them directly within Claude. We expect to introduce many more useful integrations and expand this toolkit over time.

All third-party interactions will be grounded in the same overarching design principle: they should be initiated by the user (where the AI is working for them) rather than an advertiser (where the AI is working, at least in part, for someone else). Today, whether someone asks Claude to research running shoes, compare mortgage rates, or recommend a restaurant for a special occasion, Claude’s only incentive is to give a helpful answer. We’d like to preserve that.

A trusted tool for thought

We want our users to trust Claude to help them keep thinking—about their work, their challenges, and their ideas.

Our experience of using the internet has made it easy to assume that advertising on the products we use is inevitable. But open a notebook, pick up a well-crafted tool, or stand in front of a clean chalkboard, and there are no ads in sight.

We think Claude should work the same way.

OpenAI has started testing ads in ChatGPT for select users starting today. The Sam Altman-led AI company announced that it will start showing ads to a subset of free and Go users in the US. This comes after weeks of criticism and public jabs from rival Anthropic that published ads and changed Claude's homepage aimed at mocking OpenAI’s decision to bring ads. The company also published a long blog post explaining why it believes advertising does not belong inside AI conversations and why its chatbot, Claude, will stay ad-free.In the blog post, Anthropic said advertising works well in places like search engines and social media, where users expect a mix of organic and sponsored content. However, it argued that conversations with AI assistants are different. The company said that people often share personal details, sensitive issues, or complex work problems when chatting with AI.According to Anthropic, placing ads in such conversations would feel out of place and, in some cases, inappropriate. It added that many users treat AI tools like a trusted advisor, which makes advertising a poor fit. The Claude-maker further warned that advertising introduces incentives to keep users engaged for longer, which may not align with being helpful.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman: Ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking. Users won’t see “sponsored” links adjacent to their conversations withClaude, he says.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128142287,imgsize-47682,width-400,resizemode-4/as-chatgpt-gets-ads-starting-today-anthropic39s-1000-plus-words-to-explain-why-what-sam-altman-is-doing-with-chatgpt-is-wrong.jpg"
"Mysterious tunnels found beneath 5,000-year-old pagan graves in Germany leave experts stunned",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/mysterious-tunnels-found-beneath-5000-year-old-pagan-graves-in-germany-leave-experts-stunned/articleshow/128133862.cms,"Where the tunnels were found

What was found inside the tunnel





Archaeologists in Germany have uncovered a narrow medieval tunnel system hidden beneath a much older pagan burial site, a discovery that has surprised experts and raised new questions about how different eras interacted with the same landscape. The find was announced in a January 29 press release by the State Office for Heritage Management and Archaeology of Saxony-Anhalt, following excavations near Reinstedt. While the graves date back roughly 5,000 years to the Neolithic period, the underground passage was dug thousands of years later, during the late Middle Ages, creating a rare overlap of prehistoric and medieval activity at a single site.The tunnels were found within a Middle Neolithic burial complex associated with the Baalberge culture, which flourished in the 4th millennium BC. The site consists of a large ditch enclosure and several poorly preserved burials that were originally used for ritual and funerary purposes. Excavations were carried out ahead of planned wind turbine construction, a routine process in Germany that often precedes large infrastructure projects.Archaeologists initially believed they were uncovering a grave after encountering a trapezoidal pit and a stone slab at one end.Further excavation revealed that the feature continued downward into the loess subsoil and was in fact an erdstall, a narrow underground tunnel system typically dated to the late Middle Ages. Erdstalls are found in parts of Central Europe, but their purpose has long remained unclear.The underground passage contained late medieval pottery, an iron horseshoe, animal remains, numerous stones and traces of charcoal from a brief fire. At the narrowest point of the entrance, archaeologists found larger stones stacked together, suggesting the tunnel was intentionally sealed. These finds confirmed that the structure was man-made, used for a period of time, and deliberately closed.The most striking aspect of the discovery is its location. Medieval builders chose to dig the tunnel directly beneath a prehistoric pagan burial site, a decision that archaeologists say was unlikely to be accidental. One theory is that the ancient earthworks were still visible in the Middle Ages and provided a convenient landmark. Another possibility is cultural: medieval Christian communities may have avoided disturbing pagan graves, making such sites discreet places for hidden structures.The function of erdstalls remains debated. Scholars have suggested they may have served as temporary hiding places, storage spaces, or sites for ritual or cultic activity. The narrow dimensions of the Reinstedt tunnel and the limited evidence of long-term occupation support the idea of short-term or episodic use, rather than permanent habitation.","Archaeologists in Germany have uncovered a narrow medieval tunnel system hidden beneath a much older pagan burial site.

Greenland crisis boosted Danish apps designed to identify and help boycott US goods,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/greenland-crisis-boosted-danish-apps-designed-to-identify-and-help-boycott-us-goods/articleshow/128064201.cms,"AP file photo

Canada, Greenland Show Of Power Amid Trump's ‘Invasion’ Storm; 'Difficult Times Are...'





The makers of mobile apps designed to help shoppers identify and boycott American goods say they saw a surge of interest in Denmark and beyond after the recent flare-up in tensions over U.S. President Donald Trump's designs on Greenland.The creator of the ""Made O'Meter"" app, Ian Rosenfeldt, said he saw around 30,000 downloads of the free app in just three days at the height of the trans-Atlantic diplomatic crisis in late January out of more than 100,000 since it was launched in March.Apps offer practical help Rosenfeldt, who lives in Copenhagen and works in digital marketing, decided to create the app a year ago after joining a Facebook group of like-minded Danes hoping to boycott U.S. goods.""Many people were frustrated and thinking, 'How do we actually do this in practical terms,'"" the 53-year-old recalled. ""If you use a bar code scanner, it's difficult to see if a product is actually American or not, if it's Danish or not. And if you don't know that, you can't really make a conscious choice.""The latest version of ""Made O'Meter"" uses artificial intelligence to identify and analyze several products at a time, then recommend similar European-made alternatives.Users can set preferences, like ""No USA-owned brands"" or ""Only EU-based brands."" The app claims over 95% accuracy.""By using artificial intelligence, you can take an image of a product ... and it can make a deep dive to go out and find the correct information about the product in many levels,"" Rosenfeldt told The Associated Press during a demonstration at a Copenhagen grocery store. ""This way, you have information that you can use to take decisions on what you think is right.""'Losing an ally' After an initial surge of downloads when the app was launched, usage tailed off. Until last month, when Trump stepped up his rhetoric about the need for the U.S. to acquire Greenland, a strategically important and mineral-rich Arctic island that is a semiautonomous territory of Denmark.Usage peaked Jan. 23, when there were almost 40,000 scans in one day, compared with 500 or so daily last summer. It has dropped back since but there were still around 5,000 a day this week, said Rosenfeldt, who noted ""Made O'Meter"" is used by over 20,000 people in Denmark but also by people in Germany, Spain, Italy, even Venezuela.""It's become much more personal,"" said Rosenfeldt, who spoke of ""losing an ally and a friend.""Trump announced in January he would slap new tariffs on Denmark and seven other European countries that opposed his takeover calls, only to abruptly drop his threats after he said a ""framework"" for a deal over access to mineral-rich Greenland was reached with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte's help. Few details of that agreement have emerged.The U.S. began technical talks in late January to put together an Arctic security deal with Denmark and Greenland, which say sovereignty is not negotiable.Rosenfeldt knows such boycotts won't damage the U.S. economy, but hopes to send a message to supermarkets and encourage greater reliance on European producers.""Maybe we can send a signal and people will listen and we can make a change,"" he added.The protest may be largely symbolic Another Danish app, ""NonUSA,"" topped 100,000 downloads at the beginning of February. One of its creators, 21-year-old Jonas Pipper, said there were over 25,000 downloads Jan. 21, when 526 product scans were performed in a minute at one point. Of the users, some 46,000 are in Denmark and around 10,000 in Germany.""We noticed some users saying they felt like a little bit of the pressure was lifted off them,"" Pipper said. ""They feel like they kind of gained the power back in this situation.""It's questionable whether such apps will have much practical effect.Christina Gravert, an associate professor of economics at the University of Copenhagen, said there are actually few U.S. products on Danish grocery store shelves, ""around 1 to 3%"". Nuts, wines and candy, for example. But there is widespread use of American technology in Denmark, from Apple iPhones to Microsoft Office tools.""If you really want to have an impact, that's where you should start,"" she said.Even ""Made O'Meter"" and ""NonUSA"" are downloaded from Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store.Gravert, who specializes in behavioral economics, said such boycott campaigns are usually short-lived and real change often requires an organized effort rather than individual consumers.""It can be interesting for big supermarket brands to say, OK, we're not going to carry these products anymore because consumers don't want to buy them,"" she said. ""If you think about large companies, this might have some type of impact on the import (they) do.""On a recent morning, shoppers leaving one Copenhagen grocery store were divided.""We do boycott, but we don't know all the American goods. So, it's mostly the well-known trademarks,"" said Morten Nielsen, 68, a retired navy officer. ""It's a personal feeling ... we feel we do something, I know we are not doing very much.""""I love America, I love traveling in America,"" said 63-year-old retiree Charlotte Fuglsang. ""I don't think we should protest that way.""","""Made O'Meter"" uses artificial intelligence to identify and analyze several products at a time, then recommend similar European-made alternatives. The app claims over 95% accuracy. Another Danish app, ""NonUSA,"" topped 100,000 downloads at the beginning of February.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128064177,imgsize-1259189,width-400,resizemode-4/ap-file-photo.jpg"

A man, while surfing his regular channel for adult content, found himself on the website. On screen, he saw the quality time he had spent with his girlfriend in a hotel in China's Shenzhen three weeks ago.This incident sparked an investigation into China's spy-cam porn industry, exposing how the genre, heavily fueled by the voyeuristic audience, has been operating a sophisticated network of hidden cameras, livestreams, and paid subscriptions that exploit hotel guests nationwide.A report by BBC World Service found evidence of a structured industry involving multiple actors, including installers, “camera owners”, agents, and online distributors. The content is promoted on Telegram, a channel banned in China, while higher-level operators reportedly manage camera installations and streaming infrastructure.One of the Telegram channels, managed by an agent named 'AKA' had up to 10,000 members and was promoting access to over 180 hotel-room spy-cams livestreaming intimate moments to paying consumers for fees of around 450 Yuan monthly.Subscribers were able to select from multiple feeds, which are triggered immediately after the hotel guests put their key cards in.The website also had the options to rewind footage, download clips from the archives and a chatroom.In a period of seven months, 54 cameras were identified (half active), potentially capturing thousands of unaware guests based on occupancy rates.Operators install miniature hidden cameras, sometimes as small as a pencil eraser, inside hotel fixtures such as ventilation units, wiring them directly into the building’s power supply. The agents operate as intermediaries for “camera owners”, who are believed to oversee both the physical installation of devices and the running of the online platforms.Platform archives examined in the probe contained more than 6,000 edited clips dating back to 2017, and when one camera in a Zhengzhou hotel was discovered and removed, a replacement feed was activated within hours.Although regulations introduced in April 2025 require hotels to conduct routine inspections for hidden cameras, investigators were still able to identify thousands of newly uploaded videos on six different platforms over an 18‑month period.Law enforcement cases appear scattered across multiple provinces, but experts say the sustained demand for “raw”, non-consensual footage continues to drive the market, and tests show that many commercially available camera detectors fail to identify professionally concealed devices.","Investigation into China's spy-cam porn industry exposes sophisticated network of hidden cameras, livestreams, and paid subscriptions. 54 cameras were identified (half active), potentially capturing thousands of unaware guests based on occupancy rates.

Looking ahead: Education and sustainable growth through Al Dhaid Wildlife Museum







In a significant cultural and educational milestone for the UAE’s central region, his highness Sheikh Dr Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah, inaugurated the Al Dhaid Wildlife Museum in Al Dhaid City, reinforcing the emirate’s long-term vision for environmental stewardship and public engagement with nature.Officially opened adjacent to the historic Souq Sharia’t Al Dhaid, the museum represents a qualitative addition to Sharjah’s growing network of educational and conservation-focused destinations. Its launch follows a broader transformation of Al Dhaid into a multi-faceted region where heritage, nature and community life intersect.The Wildlife Museum has been intentionally designed as an interactive and educational platform that invites families, students, researchers and nature enthusiasts to explore the rich biodiversity and ecological dynamics of the Arabian desert landscape.Spanning several specialised halls, exhibits cover a wide range of natural topics, from desert animal adaptations and plant life to geological formations and seasonal cycles. One notable feature includes a three-dimensional model of desert fauna anatomy, designed to deepen visitors’ understanding of how species thrive in harsh environments.By deploying advanced digital technologies and interactive learning tools, the museum aims to make environmental science accessible and engaging.This aligns with an emerging trend across the Gulf of blending technology with natural history to attract younger audiences and bolster public science literacy.During the inauguration speech, the Ruler emphasised the importance of sustained scientific work to preserve local ecosystems and wildlife, reaffirming Sharjah’s ongoing commitment to conservation efforts. These efforts extend beyond museum walls. For example, long-term projects such as seed collection and storage initiatives, including multi-million seed banks, reflect broader strategies to protect plant diversity and support scientific research.By featuring educational laboratories and dedicated spaces for research within the museum, the institution is positioned not only as a destination for visitors, but as a learning hub for scholars and environmental professionals. It supports initiatives that promote ecological understanding and sustainable development, which are values increasingly central to national agendas across the UAE.Spanning 2,755 square metres, the museum is thoughtfully designed with a series of specialised halls that explore the Arabian desert’s unique environment, the ways life adapts to its challenging conditions, and the rich biodiversity of plant and animal species that thrive within it.The museum’s main entrance reflects traditional Emirati architecture of the central region, featuring an arched gateway reminiscent of historic forts and heritage buildings. This design serves as a symbolic passage into a space dedicated to culture, knowledge, and environmental awareness.The earth-toned façade blends seamlessly with the surrounding desert landscape, while the hand-carved wooden gate, adorned with Islamic-inspired motifs, adds a sense of craftsmanship and authenticity. Together, these elements present a contemporary architectural expression rooted in Emirati identity and memory of place.Supporting its scientific and educational mission, the museum is equipped with a comprehensive range of facilities. These include administrative offices, dedicated spaces for scientific researchers, a fully equipped laboratory and a technical support department. Additional facilities include offices for environmental education, a programmes and activities department, a guidance unit and visitor services such as parking and support amenities.The opening of the Wildlife Museum forms part of a larger effort to reposition Al Dhaid as a destination that celebrates both its natural environment and its historical roots. Alongside the museum, restorations and new attractions are enhancing the region’s cultural circuit, bringing heritage tourism into harmony with environmental exploration.This initiative runs parallel to the restoration of historic structures and marketplaces, which collectively offer a layered visitor experience, from traditional architecture and souq culture to immersive encounters with nature. Such developments support wider sustainability narratives in the UAE, where environmental conservation, cultural preservation and community engagement are increasingly integrated into urban and regional planning.The Al Dhaid Wildlife Museum highlights how cultural institutions are evolving to serve multiple roles as centres for public education, platforms for scientific collaboration and anchors for tourism development. By promoting ecological awareness through interactive experiences and scientific engagement, the museum not only reflects Sharjah’s heritage but helps shape a future generation of environmentally conscious citizens.As the museum opens its doors, it stands as a testament to how investments in environmental education can deepen public appreciation of nature while advancing broader cultural and developmental goals across the UAE.","Al Dhaid Wildlife Museum is a hub for interactive environmental learning in Sharjah.

Why fragrance matters more during Ramadan in the Gulf



Ramadan's Secret Weapon: How Gulf Men Are Using Scent to Make a Statement in 2026





As Ramadan 2026 settles in, scent is once again taking centre stage across the Gulf. Far beyond a grooming afterthought, fragrance during the holy month is a quiet marker of identity and are worn for evening prayers, family iftars and the social rhythms that lead into Eid. This year’s Arabic cologne trends reflect a deeper return to heritage notes, layered with modern sensibilities and long-lasting compositions designed for reflective nights and festive gatherings.Deep, smoky woods continue to dominate Ramadan fragrance preferences. Oud-inspired compositions that are rich, resinous and unapologetically bold, remain a cultural staple, particularly for evening wear. These scents often unfold slowly, starting dense and powerful before settling into warm, grounding bases that linger for hours.For many men, woody fragrances feel intrinsically tied to Ramadan nights as they are dignified, spiritual and deeply comforting. Their longevity makes them ideal for long taraweeh prayers and extended family gatherings, where subtle presence matters more than projection.Amber-forward fragrances are seeing renewed popularity this season, prized for their soft warmth and enveloping character. These colognes often blend sweet resins with balsamic undertones, creating a scent profile that feels intimate rather than overpowering.Perfect for Ramadan evenings, amber scents evoke a sense of calm and contemplation, aligning naturally with the month’s reflective mood. They are especially favoured by men who want something rich yet restrained, offering depth without heaviness.For those who prefer their fragrance to make a statement, spicy oriental profiles are trending strongly in 2026. Think warm spices layered over dark woods and subtle sweetness as fragrances that feel celebratory and confident.These colognes are often chosen for post-iftar socialising and Eid gatherings, where boldness feels appropriate. The spice notes add energy, while the oriental base ensures the scent remains grounded and culturally resonant.A newer category gaining traction blends freshness with traditional depth. These fragrances typically open with citrus or aromatic notes before transitioning into woody or musky bases. The result is a cleaner, lighter take on Arabic perfumery, which is ideal for daytime fasting hours or warmer evenings.This hybrid style appeals to younger wearers and those seeking versatility: fragrances that move seamlessly from mosque visits to casual gatherings without feeling too heavy.Musk-based colognes, often paired with soft leather nuances, are emerging as understated favourites this Ramadan. These scents sit closer to the skin, offering a personal rather than performative presence.Favoured for their elegance and restraint, musky profiles align well with the quieter, inward focus of the holy month. They are particularly popular among men who prefer a refined signature scent that does not announce itself loudly but leaves a lasting impression.Across categories, one theme is clear: performance and emotional resonance matter more than novelty. Men are gravitating towards scents that last through long evenings, feel appropriate for spiritual settings and carry a sense of cultural familiarity.In Ramadan 2026, Arabic colognes are less about chasing trends and more about honouring moments, from silent prayers to joyful Eid embraces. Whether woody, spicy, amber-rich or softly musky, the season’s fragrances reflect a balance of devotion, tradition and modern personal style.","Scent is a quiet marker of identity and worn for evening prayers, family iftars and the social rhythms that lead into Eid.

Shahi Tharoor’s thoughts on reading, children and AI





Dubai’s vibrant literary scene was abuzz recently as Shashi Tharoor , Indian politician, author and former diplomat, delivered a memorable session at the Emirates Literature Festival, one of the Middle East’s premier cultural events celebrating books, ideas and global literary voices. Held annually under the patronage of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and organised by the Emirates Literature Foundation, the festival draws hundreds of speakers and thousands of readers from around the world.The 2026 edition featured more than 200 speakers from over 40 countries, bringing a mix of fiction, non-fiction, Arabic literature, poetry, performance and discussion to Dubai audiences.Tharoor’s session, titled A Wonderland of Words, also the name of his latest book, quickly became a highlight of the festival. Unlike typical lectures, his appearance blended humour, personal anecdotes and linguistic insight in a talk that felt more like an intimate conversation than a formal presentation.Moderated by British presenter Amandeep Bhangu, the session focused on how language shapes thought, culture and connection, drawing laughter and reflection in equal measure. Tharoor described his book as a series of short, reflective bursts rather than dense arguments, “bite-sized chapters, ideal for dipping in and out”, a format that felt like a quiet validation of modern reading habits.However, the real charm of the session lay in how effortlessly he braided the personal with the public, tracing his lifelong love of language back to his father, who taught himself English through persistence and curiosity rather than polish. Arriving in London and recognising the limits of his learning, his father began filling notebooks with quotations from Byron, Shakespeare and Dickens, not to impress but out of sheer delight in words.He revealed that back home, language was treated like a game: Scrabble before it was fashionable, word-building challenges where Tharoor admitted he “usually won” and even a homemade, pre-digital precursor to Wordle that allowed 20 guesses and offered no clues. Yet beneath the playfulness of his father was emotional precision, a man who wrote letters so moving that people remembered them long after his passing, whether for moments of grief, joy or setback.From him, Tharoor learned that words are not decorative flourishes but exact instruments, a pleasure in themselves and powerful because of what they can carry.Tharoor traced his fascination with language to his father’s passionate approach to English, recalling how notebooks full of quotations and impromptu wordplay games shaped his early years. “You don’t really choose a language, a language chooses you through the circumstances of your life,” he told the audience, capturing the personal, almost serendipitous nature of linguistic affinity.He also tackled the stereotype of his own “difficult vocabulary,” underscoring that words should serve clarity and connection, not confusion. “I unfortunately have an undeserved reputation for difficult words. I use the most appropriate words for what I’m trying to convey. If I can’t convey my thoughts to the audience, I’m a poor communicator. I use language to get my message across, not to confuse or impress,” he said to applause.Tharoor’s playful side surfaced in anecdotes about English eccentricities, like explanations of humorous linguistic terms and the cultural quirks of borrowing words across languages. Dubai, a global crossroads where multilingual communication is part of daily life, provided a fitting backdrop for Tharoor’s reflections on language and identity.His remarks on how English interacts with other languages and cultural contexts resonated with an audience intimately familiar with linguistic blending across communities. Quoting Nelson Mandela’s famous insight that speaking in someone’s language reaches the mind, while speaking in their own language reaches the heart, Tharoor highlighted the emotional power embedded in words and communication.In a Q&A segment, Tharoor urged parents and readers to model lifelong reading for children, asking whether they read themselves before encouraging others to read. He also warned against over-reliance on artificial intelligence in writing, stressing that outsourcing thought can dilute individuality and creative voice.Tharoor’s session exemplified the broader ethos of the Emirates Literature Festival, a belief in the transformative power of books and discussion to spur curiosity, understanding and cross-cultural exchange. Each year, the festival brings a mix of authors, thinkers and artists to Dubai, offering everything from panels and workshops to performances and interactive discussions. Its inclusive programming has helped position the city as a major cultural hub in the region.Tharoor’s appearance in Dubai was more than a book talk; it was a reminder of language’s enduring influence in an era dominated by rapid communication, digital media and global diversity. In blending personal narrative, linguistic curiosity and cultural observation, he offered the audience both entertainment and reflection. These are the qualities that make literature festivals more than mere gatherings but platforms for collective imagination and dialogue.","Shashi Tharoor is an Indian politician, author and former diplomat.

Million-Dirham Decisions Made Simple: The Tool Luxury Buyers in Dubai Are Quietly Using

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Dubai’s ultra-luxury property segment, including homes priced above Dh20 million, remains one of the hottest real estate markets globally, drawing affluent local and international investors alike. However, while listing volumes are high, identifying the right inventory with real market value and credibility can still be challenging.With hundreds of luxury transactions recorded annually, including more than 750 properties above Dh50m and over 250 valued above Dh100m in 2025 alone, the challenge for affluent buyers is not just seeing inventory but identifying the right opportunities backed by real market behaviour. Platforms like Bayut are simplifying this process with data-led tools, verified listings and specialist agent networks designed to empower discerning buyers.Instead of simply providing endless listings, Bayut focuses on three core pillars of data insights, verified availability and expert partnerships to help buyers separate signal from noise in a dynamic market environment.One of the biggest challenges for luxury buyers is knowing whether a listed price reflects actual market activity rather than wishful thinking.Bayut tackles this by offering transaction-backed insights, drawing on official Dubai Land Department (DLD) records, so that buyers can see what similar properties are really achieving in terms of sales volume and pricing.In 2025, Dubai recorded thousands of high-value property sales, including more than 750 transactions for properties above Dh50 million and over 250 above Dh100 million, underscoring both demand and the need for accurate context. This type of benchmark pricing helps buyers understand if a property is competitively priced, overpriced, or a rare value play — a crucial step before making multi-million-dirham commitments.Luxury real estate is not just about price tags, it is about deep market knowledge, negotiation experience and access to exclusive opportunities. Bayut’s ecosystem highlights specialist agents with proven track records in high-value transactions, rather than generalists who may be active across all segments.Programs like TruBroker, Bayut’s quality standard for agent credibility, help buyers identify intermediaries who are consistent, data-savvy and focused on premium markets. This makes it easier to form partnerships with professionals who understand how to position offers, anticipate buyer preferences and secure coveted properties.Luxury inventory, especially at the very top end, can be distorted by outdated listings, duplicate posts or units that are no longer available. Bayut’s technology emphasises verified listings through tools like TruCheck and cross-referencing with systems like DLD’s Madmoun to ensure that a property you’re considering is truly active and not a relic of old marketing efforts.This verification helps buyers avoid wasted time and misaligned expectations, accelerating decision-making and reducing friction in negotiations.Luxury buyers also benefit from tools that help them evaluate whether asking prices make sense relative to market benchmarks. Bayut’s TruEstimate offers valuation estimates, historical price movement analysis and demand indicators that serve as a sense check for where a property stands, helping buyers discern possible overpricing or hidden opportunity without removing the emotional appeal of design or location.Such analytical signals are especially valuable in a segment where architectural uniqueness or waterfront views can command premium pricing that may not be immediately intuitive.High-end property purchases often emerge from long-term observation rather than last-minute decisions. Features like portfolio tracking (where buyers can keep an eye on pricing trends, status shifts and comparisons across multiple shortlisted properties), give investors a structured way to monitor the market over time, rather than making impulsive choices.This kind of forward-looking visibility keeps serious buyers informed about pricing shifts, new inventory that enters the high-end space, and when timing might be right to make a move. As Dubai continues to attract wealthy buyers from Europe, Asia and the Gulf with significant activity in places like Palm Jumeirah, Dubai Hills Estate and Mohammed Bin Rashid City, the need for clarity and confidence in property selection has never been greater.Bayut’s combination of transaction-backed data, verification, specialist networks and valuation insights positions it not just as a listing portal but as a trusted guide through one of the world’s most dynamic luxury markets. In an era where information overload can mislead as easily as it informs, access to accurate data, specialised expertise and transparent tools helps buyers make smarter and more efficient decisions, whether they are picking a trophy asset or a strategic long-term investment.","Dubai’s ultra-luxury property segment, including homes priced above Dh20 million, remains one of the hottest real estate markets globally.

Dubai’s iconic coastline is undergoing one of its most ambitious transformations in years, with major beach development projects already underway and more planned through the Blue and Green Spaces 2030 Roadmap unveiled at the World Governments Summit 2026. These changes are set to reshape how residents and tourists experience Dubai’s shores, from innovative night swimming options and panoramic ocean views to entirely new “all-season” beach destinations.At the heart of this coastal evolution is Dubai Municipality’s master plan to increase public beach length from roughly 21 km to 105 km, expand facilities by up to 400% and boost recreational infrastructure, all aligned with the emirate’s broader urban lifestyle and tourism strategy.One of the most eagerly awaited upgrades is at Jumeirah Beach 1, where redevelopment is now nearly complete and official opening is expected imminently. The project has expanded the beach by about 50% and integrates new cycling, jogging and pedestrian paths alongside modern amenities such as smart lockers, Wi-Fi, AI-enhanced safety systems and climate-resilient design features.These enhancements aim not only to support active lifestyles but also to future-proof the beach against environmental pressures, with significant sand nourishment and coastal protection measures engineered into the master plan.Another major pillar of Dubai’s seaside reinvention is Al Mamzar Beach Corniche. Part of a Dh355 million redevelopment programme, the corniche will feature a 200-metre floating pedestrian bridge, the first of its kind in Dubai, connecting both sides of the beach and offering new waterfront perspectives and viewing points.The project also expands walking, running and cycling tracks, enhances public services and includes dedicated areas for active recreation, leisure dining and wellness. A 125,000 sqm women-only beach area with secure entry and tailored amenities, including children’s play zones and night swimming opportunities, will also be introduced.Night swimming has already proven wildly popular at existing beaches such as Jumeirah 2, Jumeirah 3 and Umm Suqeim 1, collectively drawing roughly 1.5 million visitors in 18 months, indicating strong public appetite for round-the-clock coastal leisure.In early February 2026, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Dubai Executive Council approved a Dh500 million master plan to transform Umm Suqeim Beach, which currently spans about 3.1 km. The redevelopment seeks to elevate the area into a year-round destination that combines urban beach life with broader tourism appeal, aiming to welcome up to 6 million visitors annually.The comprehensive project includes infrastructure upgrades, expanded parking, smart lighting for night use and integrated transport hubs, all designed to make the beach more accessible, vibrant and enjoyable. Covering nearly 445,000 square metres, the project will expand the usable beach area by around 30%.A strong focus on accessibility and safety underpins the upgrade. Smart lighting will be installed across 130,000 square metres, allowing for safer evening and night-time use. Parking capacity will increase by 200% to approximately 2,400 spaces, alongside improved road access. Connectivity across the site will be enhanced through 10 mobility hubs and 11 dedicated taxi pick-up and drop-off points, while new cycling tracks, electric vehicle facilities and scooter infrastructure will encourage sustainable transport.Dubai’s beach transformation does not stop at the sea. A new artificial “mountain beach” project in Hatta will feature a Crystal Lagoon and waterfront amenities within the mountainous landscape, bringing a unique beach experience far from the Gulf shore. This destination, complete with walking paths, cycling trails, water sports zones, dining spots and even outdoor cinemas, aims to redefine what beach tourism can look like in Dubai’s varied terrain.One of the project’s standout features is a 38-metre observation tower, inspired by Dubai’s maritime heritage. Designed as a visual landmark, the tower will offer panoramic views of the coastline, adding a new experiential highlight to the beach.Technology and sustainability are central to the redevelopment. AI-powered monitoring and operational systems will improve safety and operational efficiency, while engineering measures such as retaining walls and elevated beach levels have been incorporated to address sea-level rise. Sustainable design principles are woven throughout the public spaces, reinforcing Dubai’s long-term vision for resilient and future-ready coastal destinations.Across all projects, Dubai’s beach strategy prioritises accessibility, inclusivity and smart technology:Many of these enhancements align with Dubai’s long-term plans to elevate quality of life, boost tourism and create coastal public spaces that rival global beach destinations. The coming years will see Dubai’s beaches evolve from simple seaside escape routes into multi-faceted public destinations that blend lifestyle, technology, inclusivity and sustainability.Whether it is the expanded Jumeirah Beach 1, the connected Al Mamzar Corniche with its floating bridge, the mammoth Umm Suqeim makeover or the innovative mountain-lagoon scene in Hatta, Dubai is redefining what a beach experience can look like in the 21st century. With more space, new services and night-long leisure options, the emirate’s coastline is poised to become an even greater magnet for residents, tourists and global visitors, a continuous celebration of sun, sea and urban life.","Dubai’s iconic coastline is undergoing one of its most ambitious transformations in years.

How the service works





Why it matters









The UAE has rolled out a new public-facing security reporting service, giving residents a direct and confidential way to alert authorities to potential threats, as the State Security Department strengthens its preventive security framework.The UAE State Security Department has launched the “SSD” service, a dedicated channel that allows members of the public to report security-related concerns that could affect public safety and social stability. The initiative is designed to support faster responses, improve the efficiency of preventive security operations, and reinforce the national security system.Authorities say the service is rooted in the belief that security is a shared responsibility. Public awareness and participation are viewed as the first line of defence against potential threats. By opening a direct line of communication, the department aims to encourage individuals to take an active role in protecting national achievements and maintaining a safe and stable society.The SSD service receives reports covering a wide range of security issues. These include extremist activity, suspicious behaviour, threats to community security and individual safety, insults to the state and its symbols, information leaks, espionage, and other actions or observations that may impact social stability.Reports can be submitted through a toll-free number, 800 6600, which provides a fast and direct way for the public to share security-related information. The department has emphasised that all reports are handled with strict confidentiality. The identity of the reporter is not disclosed, and the highest standards of privacy and data protection are applied, allowing individuals to share information freely and without concern.Officials say the service is intended to strengthen community partnership and build trust between the public and security institutions. By enabling early reporting, authorities aim to prevent risks before they escalate and to preserve social peace.The launch of the SSD service also coincides with the verification of the State Security Department’s official account on the X platform. The account is positioned as an interactive channel to raise security awareness, share accurate information and alerts, and encourage constructive engagement with the public in support of national security and stability.","The UAE State Security Department has launched the ‘SSD’ service, a dedicated channel that allows members of the public to report security-related concerns.

Weather in UAE today





Early morning alert

Why this weather pattern?





Dubai and parts of the UAE are under a weather pattern that brings light rain and cloudy skies, especially in the early hours of the morning. Local forecasters including the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) have forecast light rainfall on Friday, February 6, 2026, with some coastal and inland areas seeing droplets or short showers.This comes as part of a broader unstable weather system, influenced by shifts in pressure and cloud cover building over the region, which increases the chance of rain, especially in northern and eastern parts of the UAE.Today’s daytime conditions in Dubai are expected to be fair to partly cloudy, with a pleasant high of around 26 °C and a low at night near 17–18 °C.As night approaches, humidity levels will rise, particularly over coastal areas and islands. This overnight increase in moisture raises the likelihood of fog or mist formation, which can make early morning visibility challenging for drivers and pedestrians.Winds will be light to moderate, generally from southeasterly to northeasterly directions at around 10–20 km/hr, with occasional gusts reaching up to about 30 km/hr, which might stir patches of moisture and keep the skies feeling cool and breezy.According to the latest satellite imagery from the NCM, the most consistent rainfall is predicted for Dubai, Sharjah, and Ajman.However, the ""heavy hitters"" are expected in the mountainous regions of Fujairah and Ras Al Khaimah, where the terrain naturally pushes clouds higher, leading to more concentrated downpours.In Dubai, the rain is likely to be ""intermittent,"" meaning you might experience a quick burst of heavy rain followed by a lull. For those in Abu Dhabi, the weather will remain mostly cloudy with a lower chance of direct rainfall compared to their northern neighbors.One of the biggest weather talking points for today is visibility concerns early in the morning. Because of increased humidity and the cooler night temperatures, the NCM predicts fog or mist formation across parts of Dubai and neighbouring emirates, especially in areas near the coast and low-lying districts.This morning fog could affect traffic visibility on major roads, so authorities and media outlets are advising residents to drive with caution, reduce speeds, and use headlights in foggy conditions.The recent forecasts from weather news services and the NCM highlight a trend that has been developing since earlier this week: spells of partly cloudy weather with intermittent rain chances and increasing humidity at night.Across the UAE, cloud cover has increased, bringing lighter showers and thicker skies over inland and some northern regions. This pattern is typical for the winter transition period, where moisture and temperature fluctuations make rain and fog more likely than in drier seasons.Meteorologists note that while the rain today is unlikely to be heavy, the combination of clouds, occasional showers and fog will shape the weather through today and into the weekend, so residents should stay informed through official bulletins.","Dubai and parts of the UAE are under a weather pattern that brings light rain and cloudy skies.

How job scams are evolving in the Gulf: AI and bots



Official advice: How to protect yourself against job scams in the Gulf



Verify every job offer:



Use the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) platforms to confirm a job offer’s validity. For work visas, use official government channels like GDRFA (General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs) or ICP’s eChannels in the UAE. In Saudi Arabia, check with the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development (MHRSD) or relevant Saudi government recruitment verification systems.

Never pay fees to recruiters



Check the company’s legitimacy



Use official communication channels



Retain records



What to do if you encounter a job scam in the Gulf



Stop all communication immediately.

Report the scam to local authorities such as Dubai Police’s eCrime platform or the relevant law enforcement agency in your area.

Contact your embassy or consulate for help verifying job offers from abroad.

Share warnings with friends and networks to prevent others from falling victim.

Most companies today don’t post jobs to hire.

They post jobs to collect data and train their AI.

As the Gulf continues to attract millions of job seekers, from local professionals to expatriates and international applicants, fraudulent job offers and fake recruitment schemes have become a persistent problem in the UAE and Saudi Arabia . These scams have grown more sophisticated, leveraging social media, messaging apps and even AI-powered bots to deceive applicants into losing money or exposing their personal information.Sweat not as we spill the beans on how these scams work, what the authorities are warning about and the practical steps you can take to stay safe.Dubai, Abu Dhabi in the UAE and other Gulf cities including Riyadh and Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, are magnets for global talent because of their diverse economies and high demand for skilled workers. Unfortunately, fraudsters exploit this demand by posting fake job ads that promise high salaries, minimal experience requirements and even immediate work visas.These tactics can trap unsuspecting applicants into giving up money, documents or personal data without ever receiving a legitimate job offer. Authorities have noted that the scammers use a wide range of channels, from social media and job boards to WhatsApp, Telegram and email, to make their offers look official, often using real company names or logos to lend credibility.Understanding common warning signs is one of the best defenses against job scams. Experts and police advisories in the UAE emphasise the following red flags -Recent reports highlight that fraudsters are increasingly using AI-powered bots to automate the creation of thousands of fake listings that look legitimate at first glance.These bots can even carry out simple “interviews” via automated chat before handing applicants over to human fraudsters. This makes spotting scams even harder without careful verification.Authorities in Dubai and across the UAE have issued clear guidance to job seekers on how to stay safe -Genuine employers cover visa processing and recruitment costs; if you are asked to pay any charges, it is likely a scam.Research the company’s name, trade licence information and official website. Using official registries like the UAE’s National Economic Register can help confirm legitimacy.Always prefer communication via official email addresses or company phone numbers listed on corporate websites — and avoid ad hoc WhatsApp or social media chats.Keep all correspondence, offer letters, screenshots and names in case you need to report or investigate suspicious activity.If you suspect a job offer or agent is fake:Police and labour authorities are actively cracking down on fraud; in fact, over 1,300 companies were fined AED 34 million for fake job practices in 2025 as part of a broader enforcement effort. Job scams in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, from fake offers to fraudulent visa promises, pose real risks to job seekers. With fraudsters becoming more sophisticated and using tactics like AI bots and social media deception, it is more important than ever to stay vigilant.By learning the warning signs, verifying offers through official channels and never paying upfront fees, applicants can protect themselves and make informed career decisions in one of the Gulf’s most competitive job markets.","Job scams have become a persistent problem in the UAE and Saudi Arabia.

Use of family home footage sparks privacy concerns

Questions Raised Over Police Cooperation

Who Is Lucy Letby?





A new Netflix documentary on convicted British neonatal nurse Lucy Letby has sparked fresh controversy in the UK, with her parents accusing the streaming giant of a “complete invasion of privacy” for allegedly using footage of their family home without consent.The Investigation of Lucy Letby, set to stream from February 4 on Netflix, promises viewers “unseen footage and unheard insider accounts” from one of Britain’s most disturbing criminal cases.However, even before its release, the series has drawn criticism from Letby’s family, reopening debates around ethics, victimhood and privacy in true-crime storytelling.Lucy Letby’s parents, Susan and John Letby, have said they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.In a statement to The Guardian, the couple said previous media coverage, including televised images of their daughter being led away in handcuffs, had already been “heartbreaking,” but claimed the Netflix production crossed a new line.“This documentary is on another level,” they said. “We will not watch it. It would likely kill us if we did.”A major point of contention for the Letbys is the alleged inclusion of footage filmed inside or around their long-time family home, without their knowledge.The couple said they were unaware that the documentary would feature images of the house where they have lived for more than 40 years, located in a small town where, they say, “everyone knows everyone.”They also criticised a clip shown in the documentary’s trailer, which reportedly depicts Lucy Letby being arrested in her bedroom and saying goodbye to one of her cats.“All this taking place in the home where we have lived for decades,” they said, calling it “a complete invasion of privacy.”The parents further questioned why an investigating officer involved in the case was permitted to discuss or show what occurred inside their home on the day of Letby’s arrest.“We always cooperated fully,” they said, asking why Netflix and the production company did not inform them before using such material.Netflix and ITN Productions, which produced the documentary, have not publicly responded to these claims.Lucy Letby, born 4 January 1990, is a former neonatal nurse who worked at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England. She came under suspicion after an unusually high number of infant deaths occurred in the neonatal unit between June 2015 and June 2016.After a lengthy investigation, Letby was charged in November 2020 with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder involving newborn babies.In August 2023, she was convicted of seven counts of murder and seven counts of attempted murder.She received a whole-life prison sentence, meaning she will never be eligible for release. In July 2024, she was also found guilty in a retrial of an attempted murder charge on which the jury had previously failed to reach a verdict.Letby is currently incarcerated at HMP Low Newton in Durham.","Lucy Letby’s parents say they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.

Storm Chandra

will bring persistent rain, heavy at times, later Monday and overnight before steadily clearing northeastwards on Tuesday morning. 30–50mm rainfall is likely widely, with 60–80mm across some higher ground, especially south Dartmoor. Falling on saturated ground, this is likely to lead to flooding and disruption, particularly on Tuesday morning. Strong southeasterly winds are also expected.”

“Whilst accumulating snow is unlikely at low-levels, there will be a sharp increase in snow depths with elevation, with the potential for 2–5cm in places above about 300m, 5–10cm above 400m, and 10–20cm above 500m. This may impact some high-level routes, with drifting possible in rather brisk southeasterly winds. Strong, gusty winds, especially to the west of hills, may exacerbate the potential for transport disruption.”

Initially strong winds will impact the Isles of Scilly, western Cornwall and southwest Wales which are still vulnerable after Storm Goretti, gusts of 70 to 80mph are possible here. Heavy rain is an additional hazard as it falls on saturated ground in Dorset and southern parts of Devon, Somerset and Cornwall.

As Chandra interacts with colder air further north snow becomes a hazard, with 10–20cm of snow possibly accumulating over higher ground in the Pennines, southern Scotland and the Highlands. With a complex spell of weather, it’s important people stay up to date with the forecast and any warnings in your area.”

The three items households are urged to have ready

First, a torch. British Gas recommends a battery-powered or wind-up (kinetic) torch to ensure light is available if electricity supplies are interrupted.

Second, spare batteries. Households are advised to stock up on appropriate batteries. such as AA or AAA, for torches and other essential devices.

Third, a backup charger for mobile phones. A portable battery pack with a charging cable can help people stay connected and access updates during an outage.

“You might even consider a battery-powered radio, to keep on top of local updates if you can’t use your mobile.”





The Met Office has issued a series of weather warnings covering snow, rain and wind from late Monday through Tuesday. These include a 17-hour yellow warning for rain and snow from midnight Tuesday until 5pm, an amber warning for wind in eastern Northern Ireland, and an amber warning for rain across parts of south-west England.Explaining the risk in the south of England, the Met Office said:In northern England and Scotland, snow rather than rain is the main concern. The Met Office warned:In a broader briefing on the storm, the Met Office said Storm Chandra will bring “a further spell of wet and windy conditions later Monday and into Tuesday”, with gusty winds initially affecting the Isles of Scilly, western Cornwall and south-west Wales before moving north through the Irish Sea.An amber warning for wind has been issued for eastern Northern Ireland, where gusts of 60–70mph are expected widely, with up to 75mph possible in coastal areas. Heavy rain falling on already saturated ground in south Devon, Dorset, southern Somerset and south-east Cornwall could lead to flooding, while colder air further north will turn precipitation into hill snow across northern England and Scotland.Met Office Chief Forecaster Paul Gundersen said:With the risk of power cuts rising during periods of severe weather, energy firm British Gas has urged households to make sure they have three key items readily available.British Gas added:While additional supplies such as non-perishable food and blankets can be useful, the focus of the advice is on lighting, communication and access to information during potential power disruptions as Storm Chandra moves across the UK.","UK households urged to prepare torches, spare batteries and phone chargers ahead of potential power cuts.

Samuel was sent this picture as claimed proof of delivery, though he pointed out the phone should have been signed for (Kennedy News and Media)





A delivery driver has been removed after home security footage appeared to show him faking the delivery of a £1,200 iPhone and driving away with the parcel instead.Samuel Taylor, 20, from Rochdale, ordered a £1,264 iPhone 17 Pro Max through Giffgaff, with delivery handled by DPD. On 19 January, Taylor received a photo notification claiming the parcel had been posted through his letterbox. When he returned home from work, the phone was nowhere to be found. His father confirmed no delivery had taken place.Footage from the family’s security camera showed a courier pulling up outside the house, selecting a parcel from his van and approaching the front door. Moments later, the driver appeared to walk back to the vehicle still holding the same package before driving off.“I was shocked,” Taylor said. “When I got home my dad said it wasn’t actually there. We checked the cameras and saw what happened. I was just really annoyed and I feel robbed.”Taylor contacted DPD to complain but said he was initially told the phone had been delivered and advised to raise the issue with Giffgaff. Instead, he reported the incident to Greater Manchester Police and posted the footage on social media in an effort to force the company to respond.“Since DPD are not interested in their driver not delivering my £1,200 iPhone I thought I’d shame them on here,” he wrote.Reviewing the footage later, Taylor said it became clear the driver appeared unaware he was being recorded, ruling out the possibility of an administrative mix-up or a delayed return to the depot.“I don’t think he noticed the cameras,” Taylor said. “I thought it might’ve gone back to the warehouse, but we got in touch with DPD and they said it hadn’t been signed back in.DPD later confirmed that the driver had been “removed from the business” following an internal investigation. A spokesperson said: “We have carried out a thorough investigation and can confirm that the driver has been removed from the business. We have a zero-tolerance approach to incidents such as this and will always take firm action. We apologise whole-heartedly to Mr Taylor and have informed Giffgaff.”Giffgaff said the proof of delivery did not meet its standards and confirmed Taylor’s deposit had been refunded while the case is reviewed. “We’re sorry to hear that Samuel did not receive his new iPhone as intended,” a spokesperson said.Taylor said he still has not received the phone and no longer trusts the courier. “With something that expensive it has to be signed for anyway,” he said. “I just want the phone I paid for.”","Samuel Taylor, 20, from Rochdale, ordered a £1,264 iPhone 17 Pro Max through Giffgaff, with delivery handled by DPD.

Apps to boycott US goods gain traction amid Trump's threats to Greenland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/apps-to-boycott-us-goods-gain-traction-amid-trumps-threats-to-greenland/articleshow/128090506.cms,"EU's Huge Greenland Reveal After Trump Backs Off On Tariff Threat Over Invasion Protest





COPENHAGEN: The makers of mobile apps designed to help shoppers identify and boycott American goods say they saw a surge of interest in Denmark and beyond after the flare-up in tensions over President Trump's designs on Greenland.The creator of the ""Made O'Meter"" app, Ian Rosenfeldt, said he saw around 30,000 downloads of the free app in just three days at the height of the trans-Atlantic crisis in late Jan out of more than 100,000 since it was launched in March 2025.Rosenfeldt, who works in digital marketing, decided to create the app a year ago after joining a Facebook group of like-minded Danes hoping to boycott US goods. ""Many people were frustrated and thinking, 'How do we actually do this in practical terms,'"" the 53-year-old recalled. ""If you use a bar code scanner, it's difficult to see if a product is actually American or not. And if you don't know that, you can't make a conscious choice. ""The latest version of ""Made O'Meter"" uses artificial intelligence to identify and analyse several products at a time, then recommend similar European-made alternatives. Users can set preferences, like ""No USA-owned brands"" or ""Only EU-based brands."" The app claims over 95% accuracy.""By using AI, you can take an image of a product ... and it can make a deep dive to go out and find the correct information about the product in many levels,"" Rosenfeldt told Associated Press during a demonstration at a Copenhagen grocery store. ""This way, you have information that you can use to take decisions on what you think is right.""After an initial surge of downloads when the app was launched, usage tailed off. Until last month, when Trump stepped up his rhetoric about the need for the US to acquire Greenland, a strategically important and mineral-rich Arctic island that is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark.Usage peaked Jan 23, when there were almost 40,000 scans in one day, compared with 500 or so daily last summer. It has dropped back since but there were still around 5,000 a day this week, said Rosenfeldt, who noted ""Made O'Meter"" is used by over 20,000 people in Denmark but also by people in Germany, Spain, Italy, even Venezuela. ""It's become personal,"" said Rosenfeldt, who spoke of ""losing an ally and a friend."" Rosenfeldt knows such boycotts won't damage the US economy, but hopes to send a message to supermarkets and encourage greater reliance on European producers.Another Danish app, ""NonUSA,"" topped 100,000 downloads at the beginning of Feb. One of its creators, 21-year-old Jonas Pipper, said there were over 25,000 downloads Jan 21, when 526 product scans were performed in a minute at one point. Of the users, some 46,000 are in Denmark and around 10,000 in Germany. ""We noticed some users saying they felt like a little bit of the pressure was lifted off them,"" Pipper said. On a recent morning, shoppers leaving one Copenhagen grocery store were divided. ""We do boycott, but we don't know all the American goods. So, it's mostly the well-known trademarks,"" said Morten Nielsen, 68, a retired navy officer. Sixty-three retiree Charlotte Fuglsang said, ""I love America, I love travelling in America. I don't think we should reegister protest that way.""","""Made O'Meter"" uses artificial intelligence to identify and analyse several products at a time.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

When Marc Benioff said Agentforce is central to Salesforce business

Salesforce has reportedly reduced its workforce at the start of this month. According to Business Insider, the company has cut nearly 1,000 jobs. Impacted teams include marketing, product management, data analytics, and Salesforce's Agentforce AI product that Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has previously said “is part and parcel of Salesforce”. In an interview with CNBC’s Jim Cramer, Benioff said the company’s AI program, Agentforce, is central to business. “People don’t understand that Agentforce is part and parcel of Salesforce,” Marc Benioff then said adding “It is the core of every product we make now, it is the platform.”For those unaware, Agentforce helps companies use autonomous bots to perform tasks and is meant to increase efficiency.The Business Insider report says that many of the laid off employees as part of Salesforce job cuts shared on LinkedIn that their roles had been eliminated. At least nine posts reviewed showed job losses across different teams, it says, adding two employees also confirmed the layoffs while speaking to the publication.The job cuts come at a time of leadership changes at the company. Salesforce has appointed six new executives to senior roles, replacing five top leaders who have announced their exits since December. The changes mark a period of transition in the company’s leadership structure.Salesforce has been increasingly using AI e across its operations. In August, CEO Marc Benioff said the company had used AI agents to reduce the size of its customer support team. According to Benioff, the support staff was cut from about 9,000 employees to around 5,000 by using AI-driven tools.As mentioned above, in 2025, Benioff said that Agentforce is a key part of the company’s business. He then revealed that the Agentforce platform has developed significantly since the company first introduced it in 2024. Benioff then said Agentforce has “10s of 1000s of deployments, and those customers are all ready to get to another level of execution.”","Salesforce has reportedly reduced its workforce at the start of this month.

Ads in ChatGPT: Privacy and safety rules

After weeks of criticism and public jabs from rival Anthropic, OpenAI has started testing ads in ChatGPT. Sharing a blog post, the company said it has started testing ads in the AI tool in the United States and will apply only to logged-in adult users on the Free and Go plans. “We’re starting to roll out a test for ads in ChatGPT today to a subset of free and Go users in the U.S,” OpenAI said in an X post adding “Ads do not influence ChatGPT’s answers. Ads are labeled as sponsored and visually separate from the response. Our goal is to give everyone access to ChatGPT for free with fewer limits, while protecting the trust they place in it for important and personal tasks.”OpenAI said ads are meant to help fund the infrastructure needed to keep the Free and Go tiers running and to support broader access to AI tools. The company said it will study feedback closely before expanding the program.“Keeping the Free and Go tiers fast and reliable requires significant infrastructure and ongoing investment. Ads help fund that work, supporting broader access to AI through higher quality free and low cost options, and enabling us to keep improving the intelligence and capabilities we offer over time,” the company stated in the blog post.OpenAI added that while advertising may grow over time, ChatGPT’s answers will remain independent, and user privacy will remain a core priority.As announced by the company, ads will appear only for adult users on the Free and Go tiers. Paid tiers such as Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise and Education will remain ad-free. Free users can also opt out of ads, but this will reduce the number of daily free messages they can send.OpenAI said ads will not affect how ChatGPT answers questions and that user conversations will stay private. The company described the move as a limited test aimed at learning from real-world use before any wider rollout.Users will be able to dismiss ads, give feedback, view ad history, delete ad data and manage personalization settings. OpenAI said these controls are meant to give users clear choices over their experience.OpenAI said ads will be clearly labeled as sponsored and shown separately from ChatGPT’s answers. The company stressed that ads do not influence responses. Ads are selected by matching advertiser submissions with the topic of a user’s conversation, along with past chats and past ad interactions.“During the test, we decide which ad to show by matching ads submitted by advertisers with the topic of your conversation, your past chats, and past interactions with ads. For example, if you're researching recipes, you may see ads for meal kits or grocery delivery. If there are multiple advertisers, we'll select the one that is most relevant to your chat to show you first,” OpenAI said in the blog post.OpenAI said advertisers do not have access to your chats, chat history, memories, or personal details. Advertisers will only receive aggregate information about how their ads perform such as number of views or clicks, the company stressed.Further, it will not show ads in accounts where the user is under 18 and “ads are not eligible to appear near sensitive or regulated topics like health, mental health or politics.”","OpenAI has started testing ads in its ChatGPT AI tool in the United States.

Why Microsoft needs a quality czar right now

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre. Charlie Bell, who led the company's security operations since 2021, is stepping down from that role to become what's effectively an engineering quality czar—reporting directly to Nadella.""Charlie and I have been planning this transition for some time, given his desire to move from being an org leader to being an IC engineer,"" Nadella wrote in an internal memo shared on Wednesday. ""And I love how energized he is to practice this craft here day in and day out!""Bell's replacement? Hayete Gallot, who's returning to Microsoft after an 18-month stint as Google Cloud's President of Customer Experience. She previously spent over 15 years at Redmond, climbing to the rank of corporate vice president across Windows, Office, and security teams.The shift is significant. Bell oversaw a team of roughly 10,000 people and was the driving force behind Microsoft's Secure Future Initiative—a company-wide push launched after Chinese hackers breached US government email accounts through a Microsoft Cloud exploit in 2023. That incident triggered a scathing review from the Department of Homeland Security, which called Microsoft's security culture ""inadequate.Now, Bell will work closely with cloud and AI chief Scott Guthrie and Mala Anand on what Nadella calls the ""Quality Excellence Initiative."" The initiative is aimed at delivering ""durable, high-quality experiences at global scale""—corporate speak that likely translates to fewer Azure outages, fewer broken Windows patches, and fewer out-of-band emergency fixes.Gallot's appointment signals a shift in how Microsoft thinks about its security business. Nadella specifically highlighted her ability to combine ""product building with value realization for customers."" She'll also oversee Ales Holecek, who takes on a newly created Chief Architect for Security role.The timing isn't random. During last week's earnings call, Nadella talked up momentum in security products like Security Copilot agents and Purview. The company clearly wants someone who can sell security as aggressively as they build it.Nadella's memo doesn't spell out exactly why engineering quality needs its own dedicated leader at this moment. But the clues aren't hard to find. Microsoft now uses AI to write around 30 percent of its own code, Azure outages remain a recurring headache, and Copilot adoption sits at a modest 3.3 percent among Microsoft 365 users. Bell's got his work cut out.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre.
