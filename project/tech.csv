"6 months after riot, 11 UP families return not to homes but rubble",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/6-months-after-riot-11-up-families-return-not-to-homes-but-rubble/articleshow/118130895.cms,"BAREILLY: Six months after the violence, the dust in Gausganj still hasn't settled. On July 18, communal clashes left one Hindu man dead and several injured. In the days that followed, 42 Muslim families fled or were forcibly displaced, and eight homes were bulldozed by the administration for ""encroaching on government land"". The 58 Muslim men held continue to languish in jail.Scattered and uncertain, the displaced families sought refuge in the homes of relatives in different villages, only to move again when they could afford to rent modest dwellings. With no stable income, they continued working as labourers whenever they could find work. Their children, once students, saw their education come to an abrupt halt.Now, 11 families have returned under security cover - not to homes, but to rubble, looted cupboards, shattered doors, and a village that doesn't know whether to welcome them back or push them away.Shafeekan, 60, steps carefully over what used to be her doorstep, now just a jagged remnant of concrete. ""At least I have my home back,"" she says. ""We are a family of daily wagers and I have no money to fight the cases of my two sons and husband. I don't know how they'll come out of jail.""Ruksana Begum, 62, sits on the narrow ramp of her front porch, her gaze darting toward the cops patrolling the village. ""We do not want to talk. We have no problem,"" she murmurs, before vanishing behind a tattered curtain.Mohd Tahir, 23, is here, but not to stay. ""I don't live here anymore. I work in Haryana,"" he says, his voice low, his eyes watchful. ""I came to settle my parents. Nothing is left. We have to start from scratch.""Al Jabah, 9, won't be going back to school soon. ""I saw my schoolbag torn. I don't go to school now,"" she says.For now, the survival of these families depends on charity. ""An NGO provides us with meals and basic necessities like utensils and brooms,"" says Mevish Jahan, whose son Yasinis behind bars. ""Our electricity metres are broken, and water supply is erratic.""Gausganj, once home to marginal farmers and labourers, became an open battleground following the violence. Livestock was taken. Tractors and farming equipment were seized. Land, too, is now under threat. ""We get offers through common connections, asking us to sell at throwaway prices,"" says a returnee. ""When we protested, we were threatened with more FIRs. We have little hope of justice.""For some families in the village, resentment still runs deep. Tejpal, a 23-year-old Hindu man, was killed in the riots and his family is still seeking justice. ""He was my nephew,"" says panchayat assistant Raj Kumari. ""He was murdered. And now they are being allowed back? How can we tolerate this? Today, police are with us, but what about after six months? Who will guarantee our security?"" Tensions are expected to peak as Holi approaches. ""We have set up a police picket at the village entrance,"" says Shahi SHO Amit Balyan. ""A large Hindu gathering is expected, so we're keeping a heavy force deployed.""","On July 18, communal clashes left one Hindu man dead and several injured. 42 Muslim families fled or were forcibly displaced, and eight homes were bulldozed.

IndiGo should do better here."" Another joked, ""You should carry a drill machine and hammer; make them your own. They are developing our skills."" Others added lighthearted comments like, ""Window closed for the day,"" and ""They want you to draw a window with the pink highlighter on your shirt.""While the internet had its fun, some users criticised IndiGo for a lack of transparency, arguing that passengers should be informed about seat configurations during booking.

Kendrick Lamar Shocked Everyone By Bringing Serena Williams For A Special Appearance As He Performed “Not Like Us” At The Super Bowl Halftime



Kendrick Lamar Is Being Criticised For Making His Super Bowl LIX Halftime Performance All About Drake

Kendrick Lamar made history last night as he performed his popular song “Not Like Us” at the Super Bowl Halftime. While many fans felt that Kendrick Lamar made his whole Super Bowl Halftime performance about Drake, many applauded Kendrick Lamar for having famous athlete Serena Williams as a surprise guest during his song. As many speculate the reason for bringing Serena Williams as he performed Not Like Us, fans are currently losing their minds over this.The moment Serena Williams was spotted dancing to Kendrick Lamar’s Not Like Us, fans got to work and started decoding the reason behind her appearance. Apparently, Serena Williams had dated Drake many years ago. While it is not confirmed how long the two were together, a source had revealed to Page Six that, “Serena briefly dated Drake around 2011 and even though it didn’t end that well, they have remained friends since.”However, other reports say the two were together till 2015 with Drake being spotted at matches supporting Serena. It is not confirmed how long the two were together for, but fans are applauding Kendrick for pulling this off since “Not Like Us” is a diss track against Drake.A fan took to X and wrote, “Every time I watch Kendrick I get inspired to be a bigger hater. Him having Serena Williams dancing to a diss track of drake knowing Serena history with drake is diabolical . Truly inspiring stuff.”Another fan wrote, “kendrick be so calculated i love it bc he had serena williams, who not only was raised in compton like kendrick but was also was drake’s ex dancing to not like us a diss that ruined that man’s whole life…LIKE WHO THINKS OF THAT?”But many fans have also criticised Kendrick Lamar heavily for making his whole performance at the Super Bowl Halftime all about Drake. A fan made a post on X that read as, “If we’re being honest it seemed like Kendrick Lamar’s whole superbowl performance was based around Drake. The songs, the shade, him bringing out Serena Williams, down to the “A” chain around his neck standing for “Aubrey”. That proves who the GOAT really is”Kendrick Lamar really shocked his audience by performing the diss track as many felt the NFL might not allow him to perform this song because of the ongoing lawsuit against it that has been filed by Drake.In the song “Not Like Us”, Kendrick Lamar has accused Drake of “liking” minors; an allegation that has been completely denied by Drake.A statement from Drake is awaited for the whole controversy surrounding him and Kendrick Lamar.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s booing at Super Bowl LIX possibly tied to ongoing Blake Lively-Justin Baldoni controversy, fans believe",Kendrick Lamar Shocked Everyone By Bringing Serena Williams For A Special Appearance As He Performed “Not Like Us” At The Super Bowl Halftime.

Reports Suggest Elon Musk Might Spend $40M on Super Bowl Ads Targeting Government Waste,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/reports-suggest-elon-musk-might-spend-40m-on-super-bowl-ads-targeting-government-waste/articleshow/118089210.cms,"Image via Getty Images

The Rumors Behind Musk’s Super Bowl Ad Campaign

Tesla and Electric Vehicles – The Super Bowl could be the perfect stage for Musk to unveil Tesla’s latest advancements, such as the highly anticipated Roadster 2.0 or new self-driving capabilities.

X (formerly Twitter) and Free Speech – Musk has repeatedly positioned X as a platform for unrestricted speech. A Super Bowl ad could promote its vision as the ""everything app.""

Dogecoin and Cryptocurrency – Musk has long been a supporter of Dogecoin. A playful ad could reinforce his support for the cryptocurrency, potentially driving up its value.

SpaceX and the Future of Space Travel – A teaser for the first human mission to Mars or a futuristic ad about space tourism would undoubtedly capture global attention.

Will Musk Attend Super Bowl LIX?

As the excitement builds for Super Bowl LIX , speculation is swirling about whether billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk will make a surprise appearance in the coveted lineup of commercials. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO, known for his unconventional marketing strategies and social media presence, is rumored to be spending a staggering $40 million on multiple Super Bowl ads. But is there any truth to these claims? Here’s what we know so far.Super Bowl commercials are among the most expensive advertising slots in the world, with millions tuning in to watch the spectacle. This year, a viral tweet from a user suggested that Musk is planning to run five commercials during the game, allegedly targeting government spending inefficiencies, particularly through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).Musk has been vocal in his criticism of USAID, calling it a ""viper’s nest of radical-left Marxists"" and questioning its funding. His newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has reportedly been working to expose what he perceives as unnecessary expenditures. While there has been no official confirmation from Musk or his representatives, the billionaire has a history of making bold, unexpected moves, which keeps fans and critics on edge.If Musk were to air a Super Bowl ad, it would likely focus on one of his flagship ventures. Here are a few possible themes:Despite widespread speculation, Elon Musk did not attend the game. He was present at the last two Super Bowls—once with media mogul Rupert Murdoch and later with his son, X Æ A-12. With former U.S. President Donald Trump making history as the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl, many speculated whether Musk would do the same, especially considering his increasing political influence."," speculation is swirling about whether billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk will make a surprise appearance in the coveted lineup of commercials.

The $25,000 Super Bowl Ring Incident: Did Vladimir Putin Really Steal It?

""disappeared""

In a hilarious yet wild twist, Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, is asking Russian President Vladimir Putin to return a Super Bowl ring that Putin allegedlyback in 2005. This whole drama resurfaced thanks to the release of Apple TV’s “The Dynasty” series, leaving everyone questioning: Did Putin really just walk off with Kraft's bling? Let’s dive into this strange, almost comical, story.Back in 2005, Kraft was in Russia for a business trip. Naturally, he took his Super Bowl ring along to show off—because who wouldn't, right? He had the world's attention, and Putin was in the room. According to Kraft, he showed the ring to Putin, who then put it on, made a chilling comment like,and then—just like that—took it. Yep, he walked away with it while three KGB agents apparently stood around, making it pretty clear this wasn’t your average “Hey, take a look at my ring” moment.Kraft’s ring was valued at around $25,000, although Super Bowl rings typically range between $30,000 and $50,000, depending on customization and diamond quality. So, it’s not exactly a cheap piece of jewelry—each ring is a symbol of victory, crafted with precision and sentiment. Now, imagine how much cooler it would look in Vladimir Putin’s collection of extravagant gifts from world leaders, which just so happens to include Kraft’s shiny treasure, proudly displayed in the Kremlin. Among rare artifacts and diplomatic tokens, the Super Bowl ring stands out as a unique, unexpected piece of sports history tucked away in Russia’s halls of power.After the ring mysteriously disappeared into Russian hands, Kraft publicly asked for it back. But here’s where things get weird. The White House reportedly told him to claim that he hadthe ring to Putin in order to avoid causing any tension in US-Russian relations. Kraft went along with it, stating the ring was a token of respect for the Russian people. However, he later admitted that wasn’t true at all—it was actually the U.S. government’s idea, not his.In the end, Russia insists the ring was a gift, so it's now part of Putin's private collection, safely housed in the Kremlin. But Kraft is not letting go. At a lighthearted event honoring Tom Brady, Kraft humorously asked for the ring back, joking that it hadand was still missing.This story is far from over, and with the public attention now back on it, maybe Kraft will get his bling back after all.Also read - How the Super Bowl Got Its Name: The Surprising Story Behind the Iconic Title","Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, is asking Russian President Vladimir Putin to return a Super Bowl ring that Putin allegedly stole in 2005.

Theare facing significant injury concerns as they prepare to host the Sacramento Kings on Monday, February 10, at the American Airlines Center. Star forward, listed as day-to-day with a groin injury, headlines the team’s injury report, which includes seven players in total. Anthony Davis is most likely not going to play tonight due to the injury inflicted on him in his debut game for the Mavs. The Mavericks’ injury woes extend beyond Davis. P.J. Washington (ankle), Max Christie (shoulder), and Dante Exum (illness) are all questionable, while Caleb Martin (hip) and Dereck Lively (ankle) have been ruled out. Dwight Powell, also dealing with a hip issue, is listed as day-to-day.Dallas, currently 11th in the NBA with 115.5 points per game, will rely heavily on players like Kyrie Irving and Klay Thompson to step up if Davis is sidelined. Thompson, the team’s most prolific three-point shooter, averages three made threes per game, ranking 18th in the league.Davis, who leads the Mavericks with 25.7 points per game (10th in the NBA) and averages 12 rebounds (6th in the league), is a critical piece of Dallas’ lineup. His potential absence could severely impact the team’s performance against a Kings squad that enters the game with a clean bill of health.The Kings, on the other hand, have no players on their injury report. Domantas Sabonis, averaging a league-leading 14.3 rebounds per game, and DeMar DeRozan, contributing 22.3 points per game, will look to capitalize on Dallas’ depleted roster.The game, scheduled for 8:30 PM ET, will be broadcast on NBCS-CA, KFAA, and WFAA, with live streaming available on Fubo.

Theare set to take on the Milwaukee Bucks at Fiserv Forum on Monday, February 10, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET, but all eyes are on the injury report as both teams navigate key absences. While the Warriors’ star guardis not listed on the injury report, the team will be without forward Jonathan Kuminga, who is sidelined with an ankle injury. Stephen Curry , who leads the Golden State Warriors with 23.0 points per game, remains a critical piece for Golden State as they aim to break their .500 record (26-26). Over the last 20 games, Curry has averaged 20.8 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 4.9 assists, while knocking down 3.9 three-pointers per game. His ability to stretch the floor and create scoring opportunities will be vital against a Bucks team missing their own superstar, Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is out with a calf injury.Golden State’s injury report, while relatively light compared to Milwaukee’s, still poses challenges. Kuminga’s absence leaves a gap in the Warriors’ frontcourt, putting additional pressure on Kevon Looney and Trayce Jackson-Davis to step up. Looney, averaging 6.9 rebounds per game, will need to anchor the defense and control the boards against a Bucks team that ranks 17th in rebounds per game (44.1).The Warriors’ three-point shooting, led by Stephen Curry’s league-leading 4.3 made threes per game, could be the difference-maker. Golden State averages 15.5 three-pointers per game, fourth-most in the NBA, and will look to exploit Milwaukee’s perimeter defense, which allows opponents to shoot 35.7% from deep.The Bucks will also be without Pat Connaughton, also sidelined with a calf issue. Milwaukee’s offense will rely heavily on Damian Lillard, their leading scorer at 25.5 points per game, to compensate for the absence of Antetokounmpo. Lillard has been a consistent force, averaging 24.6 points and 7.0 assists over the last 20 games.Fans can catch the game on NBA TV, NBCS-BA, or FDSWI, with live streaming available on Fubo.

On Wednesday, themade a historic trade by acquiring Jimmy Butler in a multi-team trade with the Miami Heat. The addition of Butler gave the Warriors an extra layer of star power as they approach the second half of the season. However, despite this high-profile acquisition, Golden State’s roster still has its flaws, particularly in terms of perimeter shooting.To address this issue, the Golden State Warriors may be eyeing a former New York Knicks forward, Bojan Bogdanovic , who could potentially land on the buyout market. Known for his sharp shooting ability, Bogdanovic could offer much-needed support to Stephen Curry and the Warriors’ offensive scheme.Clutch Points’ Jedd Pagaduan wrote Saturday.While the comparison is not perfect, the need for an experienced shooter like Bogdanovic could be significant for the Golden State Warriors, especially with Curry leading the charge.Bogdanovic, who spent the first half of the 2023-24 season with the Detroit Pistons before being traded to the Knicks, has been plagued by injuries, which have limited his time on the court. The 35-year-old forward appeared in 29 regular-season games and four playoff contests with New York, averaging 10.4 points on 37.0% three-point shooting during the regular season. He also posted 6.0 points on 40% three-point shooting in the postseason before a wrist injury and a season-ending foot injury took him out of the lineup.Though he has been cleared for on-court work, it’s unclear if Bogdanovic can fully recover in time to make a major impact.Pagaduan questioned, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the veteran’s health.After undergoing offseason foot surgery, Bogdanovic has not appeared in any games for the Brooklyn Nets this season. Despite this, his reputation as a strong perimeter shooter makes him a potential fit for the Golden State Warriors, a team that relies heavily on long-range shooting. While he may struggle defensively, his ability to space the floor and shoot from deep could provide an immediate offensive boost for Golden State.Also read: NBA Buyout Rumor: Golden State Warriors reportedly eyeing $5.25 million NBA Champion to replace $25 million star guard; better fit for Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler?

When Kendrick Lamar took the stage at the Super Bowl Halftime Show , he didn't just deliver To put it mildly, it was an incendiary performance – he set the internet on fire. From his iconic rhymes to that heart-pounding energy, K.Dot had everyone vibing both in-stadium and at home. As we all know, wherever there is hype, there is also something negative.Here's Maria Hader, the wife of MLB superstar Josh Hader; she fights for every good thing in this world and doesn't care whether she lives or dies in the fight. Maria also had the perfect placating response to the minuscule negativity surrounding Kendrick's performance. In all that sass and charm of a woman who knows her way around a heated section of commentary, Maria reshared a blazing video of Serena Williams , who appeared completely lost in the moment during the performance of ""Not Like Us."" That clip was all-action as it showed the Grand Slam champ firing up to the tunes with the same energy we expect from a Grand Slam champ.Maria hasn't just reshot the video on her Instagram story, but then she has added a bit of zest with the ultimate caption: ""YESSSS!"" If you've seen Serena groove, you know it doesn't get more legendary. And Maria's reaction? Pure gold. That little word - YESSSS - said so much.A lot of people greased their hands with discussions about Kendrick’s inclusion into the show, but Maria wasn't one of them. She has brought the house down for her lady and led any negative comment into just more charcoal at the funeral pyre. The clip was not only an exhibition of her dance moves but also a declaration that the public had tried futilely to drain the coolness and creativity Kendrick brought on the table.And let's keep it real: if there is anyone who knows the power of a ""clapback,"" it's Maria Hader. We've seen her defend her husband, Josh, in such fierce loving ways, and just as in this cheerful but bold response to those hating on Kendrick, she's always keeping it 100.Well, in short, Kendrick Lamar will forever be remembered in terms of his performance and what can be said about the vibes that Serena brought into the whole show. And Maria? Again, she proved that when it comes to putting someone on the defense for things she loves-whether music, sports, or women empowerment-she is apt enough to combine her elation and confidence to spin it. So tomorrow when you want to come for the king of hip hop or his fans, know that Maria Hader has the ""YESSSS"" ready.",Kendrick Lamar's performance at the Super Bowl Halftime Show set the internet on fire.

The 47-year-old rapper's recent antics both online and in public have raised concerns about his mental health and behaviour.The controversy began on the Grammys red carpet, where West made headlines by asking his wife, Bianca Censori, to remove her black coat, revealing a provocative see-through dress to photographers. West later boasted that Bianca's Google search numbers had surpassed those related to the Grammy Awards.However, it was West's online behaviour that triggered alarm bells. In a podcast interview, he dismissed claims of bipolar disorder, asserting instead that he is autistic, a statement met with scepticism. His X account soon became a platform for unfiltered and offensive content, including anti-Semitic, misogynistic, and racist remarks. West even went as far as declaring himself a Nazi, promoting Nazi-themed merchandise on his website, criticising overweight women, and sharing porn.Prominent figures like David Schwimmer and Piers Morgan publicly demanded the suspension of West's account. In response to the growing criticism, West posted cryptic messages, hinting at his potential removal, ""Elon stopped following me, so I don't know how much longer I'll be on Twitter / X. If I'm deleted, go to [link to his merchandise site].""In what appeared to be a farewell post, West wrote, ""I'm logging out of Twitter. I appreciate Elon for allowing me to vent.

Known as the ""hunchback"" minaret, it earned its name due to its leaning shape.Unesco spearheaded the restoration of this architectural marvel, which stands as part of the Al-Nuri Mosque , utilising original brickwork in the reconstruction process.Abdullah Mahmoud from Iraq's antiquities department expressed the significance: ""Al-Hadba is our identity, and restoring it means the city has reclaimed its identity"". The 12th-century structure maintains its distinctive 160-centimetre lean, identical to its tilt in the 1960.The Al-Nuri Mosque, where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed his self-styled caliphate in July 2014, was razed in June 2017 during Mosul's liberation battle. Iraqi officials stated that IS forces planted explosives before withdrawing.The five-year Unesco restoration incorporated 26,000 original bricks for the exterior, with 96,000 new bricks added internally for structural support. The foundation received additional reinforcement to stabilise the tilt.The restoration effort extended to the mosque's columns, dome and courtyard. The mihrab was restored using original stonework, whilst the minbar required substantial reconstruction due to missing original components.Former muezzin Imad Zaki observes the restoration daily, stating: ""Every day I stand here for an hour to watch as they are restored to their original state. Today one can feel the spirituality. It's as if our souls have finally found peace.""Unesco's broader restoration initiative includes the Al-Tahira Church from 1862, featuring reconstructed arcades, pillars and stained-glass windows. Archaeological discoveries include an underground cellar and wine vessels, now displayed beneath glass flooring.Unesco Iraq's senior project manager Maria Acetoso noted the transformation: ""When I arrived here in 2019, it looked like a ghost city. In five years plus, there has been a massive change.""Despite progress, Mosul's recovery continues. The clearance of 12,000 tonnes of debris was necessary for landmark restoration, whilst numerous neighbourhoods remain damaged.In the Old City, buildings marked 'safe' in red indicate explosive clearance. Many former inhabitants, particularly Christians, await return.Mohammed Kassem, now residing in a new dwelling, believes the city requires further reconstruction and the return of its original residents, particularly the Christian community.Saad Mohammed, 65, residing opposite Al-Nuri Mosque, recounts the IS period: ""We opened the window once and saw the black IS flag on top of the minaret. Then we opened it again, and the minaret was gone."" Now, with restored landmarks, he remarks, ""Today the minaret has risen again.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.
