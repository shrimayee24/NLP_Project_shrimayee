Alex Bregman Can Still Sign The $156 Million Offer Pending And Rejoin The Houston Astros



The Houston Astros Team Is Also Eager To Welcome Alex Bregman Into The Team Again



Alex Bregman, one of the most talented players in the Major League Baseball, still remains a free agent with the Spring Training being just a few weeks away. Alex Bregman had reportedly rejected a six year deal for a whopping $156 million with his former team, the Houston Astros. But now the deal is ‚Äústill on the table‚Äù as per USA Today's Bob Nightengale‚Äôs statement on ""Area 45 with Bijani and Creighton"".Bob Nightengale has gone on to explain that even though the star player of Major League Baseball had rejected his former‚Äôs team offer, the offer is still left on the table for Alex to consider and come back to. But this time, it is not just his former team, the Houston Astros, who are offering a six year deal for $156 million; it is also one of the strongest teams in the MLB, the Toronto Blue Jays, that has ended up making a similar offer to the star player.But nothing has been confirmed yet either by Alex Bregman nor by his agent, Scott Boras. Many fans believe that the Toronto Blue Jays are aiming to acquire Alex Bregman because Pete Alonso has not been able to ‚Äúmake up his mind‚Äù.A fan took to X and wrote, ‚ÄúThe Toronto blue jays seem to be prepared for plan B, since Alonso can‚Äôt make his mind up, offering Alex Bregman a 6 year contract.‚ÄùAnother fan hoped that Alex Bregman chooses the Toronto Blue Jays over the Houston Texas. The fan wrote, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôd be nice if Alex Bregman signs with the Toronto Blue Jays üôè‚ÄùHowever, fans of Alex‚Äôs former team, the Houston Astros are hoping that he makes a return to his former team. A few days ago, at the Houston Astors Fan Fest, the team had spoken about Alex Bregman returning the the Astros since he still remains a free agent.As per a video posted by MLB.com‚Äôs Brian McTaggart on X, Dana Brown, the general manager of the Houston Astros said, ‚ÄúThe fact that he‚Äôs still available, it just makes it interesting. Like man, this guy is such a good player, he‚Äôs done so many wonderful things here.‚Äô We‚Äôll stick with the cracked door and see where our conversations lead.‚ÄùAt the same event, Alex Bregman‚Äôs long time friend and teammate, Jose Altuve has spoken about changing his position and moving to Left Field for Alex Bregman to come back since the Astros have already signed a deal with Isaac Paredes and Christian Walker.While Jose has attracted a lot of appreciation for his statement, many fans have slammed Alex Bregman for turning down the Houston Astros. With Spring Training coming up in just a few weeks, Alex Bregman‚Äôs position remains unconfirmed.Also Read: Pete Alonso won‚Äôt be firing Scott Boras despite losing a $70 million deal and Mets negotiations causing a stir","Alex Bregman, one of the most talented players in the Major League Baseball, still remains a free agent.

Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic. In his memoir, Spare, the Duke of Sussex talks about reaching out to a medium with supernatural abilities to communicate with Diana, who passed away in a car accident in Paris in 1997, just before his 13th birthday, The Mirror reported.The Duke received a message from his mother through the psychic, who told him, ""You're living the life she wanted for you."" Harry, now 40, says that the medium also told him his mother was with him ""right now,"" which made his neck warm and his eyes fill with tears. The psychic shared that Diana knew Harry was ""looking for clarity"" and ""feels your confusion."" She added that Diana understood Harry had ""so many questions"" and that answers would come in time.Another anecdote involved Prince Harry‚Äôs son, Archie. The psychic reportedly described how Diana‚Äôs spirit witnessed Archie accidentally breaking a Christmas tree ornament shaped like Queen Elizabeth. When asked, Harry admitted the incident had occurred, adding that Archie had attempted to fix the ornament.The medium suggested Diana found humour in the situation, delighting in the antics of her grandson she never had the chance to meet.In Spare, Prince Harry also recounts an extraordinary encounter with a leopard during a trip to Botswana with his brother, Prince William. He interpreted the animal‚Äôs presence as a comforting sign from his late mother, suggesting that ""everything will be fine."" However, the experience was not without fear, as he briefly worried the leopard might attack.Harry has been candid about the psychological toll of losing Diana so young. As reported by The Mirror, he disclosed a haunting period after her death when he entertained the possibility that she had staged her demise. His anguish led him to repeatedly drive through the Paris tunnel where Diana‚Äôs life was cut short, attempting to make sense of the tragedy.","Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic.

What Swastika Mukherjee said about Uber Pet

Bengali actor and animal lover Swastika Mukherjee has criticised Uber's pet taxi service for its high prices after being charged Rs 487 for a 5km ride in Delhi. This follows an incident where an Uber driver allegedly refused a ride to Rakshita Singh, owner of the Dular Amaanat Foundation, who was carrying puppies in a basket during a medical emergency. The driver reportedly told Singh to exit the cab, stating it was ‚Äúintended solely for human passengers and not for animals.‚Äù She then booked an Uber pet taxi and was charged a significantly higher fare compared to a traditional cab for the same distance.Responding to the criticism, Uber took to the comment section of the post to write: ‚Äú@straysofdelhi_ Hi there - At Uber, we're committed to providing a smooth, reliable experience for both pet owners and drivers. The surcharge for Uber Pet covers the costs associated with vehicle cleaning and maintenance to ensure that the car is ready and comfortable for subsequent riders.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, ‚ÄúTo do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.‚ÄùUsers will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

The artificial intelligence (AI) industry has seen rapid advancements in recent years, with companies from around the world competing to develop the most powerful and cost-effective models. A new entrant, DeepSeek, a Chinese AI application, has emerged as a significant competitor to established U.S. firms such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. DeepSeek has gained widespread attention for its claim that its R1 model was developed at a fraction of the cost of its competitors, prompting discussions about the future of AI and its global economic impact.The app has already made waves in the market, becoming the most downloaded free app in the United States within a week of its launch.Its success has even prompted political figures, including former U.S. President Donald Trump, to call it a ‚Äúwake-up call‚Äù for the American technology sector. But how does DeepSeek compare to well-established AI platforms such as ChatGPT and Google‚Äôs Gemini? Here's a detailed look at DeepSeek‚Äôs capabilities across various domains, including writing assistance, coding, brainstorming, and research.One of the most common uses of AI models is content generation. ChatGPT has gained popularity for its ability to assist users with writing blog posts, summarizing information, and structuring ideas in a logical and well-organized manner.To compare their writing abilities, DeepSeek and ChatGPT were given a simple prompt:While both AI models performed well, ChatGPT‚Äôs response was more structured and comprehensive, whereas DeepSeek delivered a factual list with a brief description.Developers have increasingly relied on AI models to assist with debugging, generating code snippets, and problem-solving. Recently, when ChatGPT experienced an outage, many developers took to social media, expressing their dependence on AI-powered coding assistance.AI researcher Javier Aguirre from Samsung Medical Center in South Korea tested DeepSeek's ability to solve complex coding problems. According to his analysis:According to Addy Osmani, Head of Chrome Developer Experience at Google, DeepSeek is not only highly capable but also significantly cheaper compared to OpenAI‚Äôs latest models. This cost-effectiveness could make it an attractive alternative for companies and individual developers alike.Another key use of AI models is idea generation and creative writing. To test this, both DeepSeek and ChatGPT were given the prompt:While ChatGPT provided a variety of creative directions, DeepSeek‚Äôs approach was to generate a complete narrative instantly. This suggests that DeepSeek may be better suited for users looking for a full draft rather than brainstorming multiple concepts.AI models are frequently used for research and education, particularly for simplifying complex historical and scientific topics. A common challenge is explaining the causes of World War I, a topic often covered in school curricula.Overall, ChatGPT and Gemini provided more comprehensive research-based responses, whereas DeepSeek‚Äôs strength lies in delivering concise summaries.DeepSeek‚Äôs rapid rise has demonstrated that the U.S. AI companies no longer have a monopoly over the market. Its ability to perform tasks at a lower cost while maintaining competitive accuracy and efficiency raises questions about the future of AI development and global competition.Experts, including Professor Neil Lawrence from the University of Cambridge, believe that AI innovation is just beginning. He compared the current AI landscape to historical breakthroughs in engineering, noting that ‚Äúthere is plenty of space for budding James Watts to emerge,‚Äù referring to innovators who may refine and improve existing AI models rather than invent entirely new systems.","DeepSeek is the most widely used AI chatbot globally.

Use process of elimination: Cross off words as you place them into groups, narrowing the possibilities for the remaining categories.

Think creatively: Some categories require outside-the-box thinking, like interpreting word segments or understanding cultural references.

Learn from mistakes: Each incorrect guess provides clues. Use these to refine your approach for future puzzles.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle‚Äôs theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you‚Äôve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you‚Äôve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Microsoft to bring DeepSeek to Copilot+ PCs; read the company‚Äôs statement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-to-bring-deepseek-to-copilot-pcs-read-the-companys-statement/articleshow/117792603.cms,"What Microsoft said about running DeepSeek models on Copilot+ PCs



‚ÄúThe optimized DeepSeek models for the NPU take advantage of several of the key learnings and techniques from that effort, including how we separate out the various parts of the model to drive the best tradeoffs between performance and efficiency, low bit rate quantization and mapping transformers to the NPU. Additionally, we take advantage of Windows Copilot Runtime (WCR) to scale across the diverse Windows ecosystem with ONNX QDQ format.‚Äù

Microsoft has announced that it will bring the latest DeepSeek R1 artificial intelligence models directly to Windows 11 Copilot+ PCs. This will allow developers to build and run AI apps locally on these devices. The distilled 7B and 14B variants of DeepSeek R1 will be available through the AI Toolkit which will be optimised for the NPUs (Neural Processing Units) found in these PCs.This move aims to empower developers and accelerate the creation of AI-powered apps on Windows.Initially, DeepSeek models will be available on Qualcomm Snapdragon X-equipped PCs, followed by Intel Core Ultra 200V (Lunar Lake) CPUs and others. Developers can use these models for experimentation and local deployment, accessing them through the AI Toolkit VS Code extension.Microsoft claimed that it has incorporated insights gained from Phi Silica, a small language model (SLM) for Windows 11, particularly in optimising battery consumption and PC resource usage, and applied them to the DeepSeek models.In a blog post, the company wrote:This means that DeepSeek AI-optimised apps will run locally on Copilot+ PCs. To meet the requirements, these Windows 11 devices must feature a neural processing unit (NPU) with at least 40 TOPS (trillion operations per second), 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and 256GB of storage.These specifications align with many PCs powered by Snapdragon X Elite, X Plus, and the newly announced Snapdragon X chips, such as the Dell XPS 13.Microsoft has quickly embraced DeepSeek, despite concerns over data collection and allegations of copying ChatGPT. However, it's important to note that the company is deploying a local model of DeepSeek R1.",Microsoft has announced that it will bring the latest DeepSeek R1 artificial intelligence models directly to Windows 11 Copilot+ PCs.

DeepSeek , a Chinese artificial intelligence chatbot, has rapidly gained global attention, sparking debates over privacy, data security, and national security concerns. Since its launch, the chatbot has become one of the most downloaded AI applications, particularly in Western countries like the United States and the United Kingdom. However, its rapid rise has also led to scrutiny from government officials and cybersecurity experts who worry about how user data is being handled.Australia's science minister, Ed Husic, has become the first Western government official to openly question DeepSeek‚Äôs privacy policies, urging caution over its potential risks.Similar concerns have been raised by U.S. officials, including the White House and the U.S. Navy, which has reportedly banned the use of DeepSeek by its personnel. While DeepSeek has yet to respond to these criticisms, its data collection practices and affiliations with Chinese entities have fueled concerns that it could be used for surveillance or data harvesting.As debates continue, many users remain unaware of the possible implications of using DeepSeek. This article explores the concerns raised by government officials, the app‚Äôs data collection practices, and whether it is safe for public use.On Tuesday, Australia‚Äôs science minister, Ed Husic, told ABC News that there were still many ""unanswered questions"" about how DeepSeek manages data and privacy. He warned users to be ""very careful"" and emphasized that such risks must be taken seriously.Husic‚Äôs statement comes amid ongoing global scrutiny of Chinese technology companies, with firms like Huawei and TikTok previously facing similar allegations. Many Western nations worry that Chinese tech companies could be linked to the Chinese government and that user data may be exploited for intelligence gathering.While Husic has not called for any immediate bans or restrictions, his statement marks the first time a Western government official has publicly expressed concerns about DeepSeek‚Äôs data policies.In the United States, concerns about DeepSeek have also reached high levels of government. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that the National Security Council was investigating the potential risks associated with the chatbot.Additionally, according to a report from CNBC, the U.S. Navy has reportedly prohibited its personnel from using DeepSeek due to ""potential security and ethical concerns."" The Navy has not officially commented on the ban, but the move highlights growing fears that DeepSeek could pose risks to national security.Former U.S. President Donald Trump also weighed in on the matter, calling DeepSeek a ""wake-up call"" for the United States. However, rather than framing it as a direct security threat, Trump suggested that competition from DeepSeek might push American companies to innovate and lower costs.Despite the scrutiny, DeepSeek has continued to gain popularity in the U.S., with millions of downloads reported in recent weeks.According to its privacy policy, DeepSeek collects a significant amount of user data, including:DeepSeek claims that this data is stored securely in China and is used to improve the chatbot‚Äôs performance, security, and stability. Additionally, the privacy policy states that DeepSeek may share user data with:The policy also states that DeepSeek will keep this data ""for as long as necessary,"" though it does not specify an exact timeframe.Cybersecurity experts have raised alarms over a particular clause in the privacy policy, which states that data may be used ""to help match you and your actions outside of the service."" Lauren Hendry Parsons , a digital privacy advocate from ExpressVPN, warned that this clause ""should immediately ring alarm bells for anyone concerned with their privacy.""While DeepSeek‚Äôs data collection practices have sparked controversy, some experts argue that they are not fundamentally different from those of other AI models, including:Many of these AI services also collect personal data to improve performance and provide more accurate responses. However, concerns surrounding DeepSeek stem from its Chinese ownership and the lack of clear data protection regulations governing its operations.Emily Taylor, CEO of Oxford Information Labs, pointed out that any AI model with a web or app interface collects user prompts and responses. ""Anyone working on confidential or national security areas needs to be aware of those risks,"" she said.Similarly, Dr. Richard Whittle from the University of Salford noted that while he has concerns about DeepSeek, he also has ""plenty of concerns"" about U.S.-based AI models. He advised consumers to be cautious, especially when dealing with a new and highly popular AI service.As concerns grow, regulatory bodies have started addressing the potential risks associated with AI-powered chatbots.The UK‚Äôs Information Commissioner‚Äôs Office (ICO) has urged users to be aware of their rights regarding how their personal data is used to train AI models. In a statement to BBC News, the ICO emphasized that AI developers must:The ICO also warned that it would take regulatory action against companies that fail to comply with these expectations.Meanwhile, Australian officials continue to monitor DeepSeek‚Äôs operations, and it remains to be seen whether further restrictions or regulatory measures will be introduced.","Australia warns users to be cautious about DeepSeek‚Äôs data privacy policies.

AT&T CEO John Stankey was asked about DeepSeek that shocked US stock market earlier this week, wiping out billions from market capital of technology companies led by AI chip giant Nvidia.AT&T CEO Stankey was asked about the impact of Deepseek and if the company planned to use cloud and AI to both improve relationships with customers, improve product and lowering their overall expenses.To this Stankey replied, ""We‚Äôve used it a lot internally in our operations. We‚Äôre seeing demonstrative improvements in our code effectiveness. And I shared this on a previous call, we‚Äôre spending less right now to develop new code internally and getting more. And it‚Äôs through the application of AI and the technology and what we‚Äôre able to do with generative AI.""Commenting further on the impact of DeepSeek, he said,""I would expect for a nascent technology like this that we‚Äôre going to have those moments because necessity is the mother of invention. And there‚Äôs a lot of money, an awful lot of money and a lot of creative minds working on this. And people are going to come up with better ways to apply it,"" he added.""And we‚Äôre all going to have to stay on our game to make sure we use it effectively so none of us are in a disadvantaged position relative to our competitors on cost structure effectiveness. I think there are places where I would like to see our business get better at doing this, which is using the data that we have to start doing things that are unique to us, which handling particular customers and segments of the base and those that we don‚Äôt have as customers and understanding how we price and attack those things and using the unique data sets that we have around our infrastructure, how that lines up to particular customer segments, in particular, industries to get more effective in the market,"" we went on to add.Talking about the gaol for 20025, Stankey said, ""If I were to say I had a goal for 2025, I would like to this time next year be talking about good momentum we‚Äôve received in business as a result of executing on some of those things moving forward.""","DeepSeek is a hot topic on earnings calls this quarter.
