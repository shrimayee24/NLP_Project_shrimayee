What is causing this aurora event

Clouds and city lights change the experience





Northern skies do not usually proclaim themselves. Most nights are calm, even when something faraway moves above the earth. This week is little different. A pulse of solar activity is travelling across Earth's magnetic field, and this change could be enough to bring the northern lights into view in portions of the United States. It is not guaranteed, and it will not appear the same everywhere. Some people may notice a gentle tint on the horizon, while others may see nothing. However, for a brief period in early January, the odds shift somewhat. Space weather forecasters and sky watchers are keeping a tight eye on the darkness, hoping it may reveal something unexpected rather than being empty for once during the harshest stretch of winter evenings.The strongest chances sit far north, as they usually do. Alaska remains the most reliable place, almost separate from the rest of the map when it comes to aurora watching. Parts of:These areas lie closer to where Earth’s magnetic field funnels charged particles into the atmosphere. NOAA forecasts suggest activity could peak overnight between January 8 and January 9, though timing often slips by hours. In these states, the lights may form brighter arcs or slow-moving curtains rather than faint smudges.Even then, nothing is promised. Auroras are known for appearing briefly and fading without warning.States a little below the usual aurora belt are not entirely out of luck. Minnesota, Michigan, and Maine often sit on the edge during moderate geomagnetic storms, and this week could be another of those moments. The display in these places is usually subtle. Colour may appear washed out, sometimes closer to grey than green. It often stays low in the northern sky, easy to mistake for a cloud or distant glow. Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire, and parts of New York fall into a similar category. For viewers there, seeing the aurora often depends on patience and expectations. Many who do catch it only realise later when photos reveal more than the eye noticed at the time.The trigger comes from the Sun, though not in a dramatic, cinematic way. A coronal mass ejection has sent a stream of charged particles outward, interacting with a co rotating interaction region already moving through space. Together, they disturb Earth’s magnetic field just enough to produce a G1-level geomagnetic storm. That rating is considered minor, but minor does not mean invisible. It simply means effects are more local and less intense. Space weather remains difficult to predict with precision. Solar wind speed, density, and direction can all shift suddenly. Forecasts improve as the storm arrives, but uncertainty never fully disappears.Even the strongest aurora means little under thick cloud. Cloud cover remains the biggest reason people miss these events, regardless of solar activity. Clear skies matter more than most other factors. Light pollution is the next obstacle. Urban lighting can wash out faint auroras entirely, especially in southern locations. Rural areas, coastal stretches, and dark sky parks offer better odds. Many experienced observers suggest letting your eyes adjust and avoiding phone screens for a while. Cameras often see more than humans do, especially in low light modes. Sometimes the night still looks empty. Sometimes it does not. That uncertainty is part of the pull.","A pulse of solar activity is travelling across Earth's magnetic field.

Leon Draisaitl of the Edmonton Oilers drives a Genesis from Genesis Edmonton!

Details on Leon Draisaitl's luxury car collection



Leon Draisaitl, a two-time NHL Art Ross Trophy winner, has made a name of being exceptional both on and off the ice. Outside of hockey, being an Edmonton Oilers player, Draisaitl is a person who enjoys quality and modest cars. He does not belong to the group that prefers high-powered sports cars but prefers comfort, practicality, and long-term value in his car purchases.The luxury car collection by Draisaitl shows that he is connected to his German heritage but with a contemporary style. His collection has received extensive coverage in other media, such as YouTube reviews and car coverage, which gives fans an idea of the lifestyle of one of the best stars in the NHL.The main product that Draisaitl features in his ambassador position with the brand is the Genesis GV80, a luxury SUV that he drives. A review on YouTube argues that Genesis has quality craftsmanship and modern design, which is in line with the idea of Draisaitl, who is fond of understated but luxurious cars.In Ontario, Draisaitl was seen in a Jeep Wrangler Rubicon and a Jeep Grand Cherokee, which combine both competency and rough versatility. These options reflect his practicality without loss of style, which is ideal when it comes to outdoor activities or city driving.German engineering is also something that Draisaitl likes, and he owns a vehicle such as the Volkswagen Tiguan and the BMW models, among other cars. These choices give him a real connection to his German roots and can provide him with reliable and high-performance cars. His luxury car line consists of an extended lifestyle: grounded, personal, and planning, with lifestyle and functional excellence.To the NHL news outlet enthusiasts or those interested in tracking the lifestyle stories of the Edmonton Oilers, the choice of cars Draisaitl drives should provide an idea of how even high-performance, high comfort, and high personal branding athletes can balance their choices. His portfolio includes luxury SUVs, practical jeeps, and elegant German cars as a testament to quality, considered decisions, and not high-handedness.Also Read: Sidney Crosby’s lifestyle: Inside Pittsburgh Penguins captain’s luxury watch collection and personal style","Edmonton Oilers forward Leon Draisaitl is a two-time Art Ross Trophy winner.

Dubai’s Palm Monorail halts service indefinitely: 5 best alternative routes to get around Palm Jumeirah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubais-palm-monorail-halts-service-indefinitely-5-best-alternative-routes-to-get-around-palm-jumeirah/articleshow/126484934.cms,"Dubai Palm Monorail Suspended Indefinitely for Maintenance: 5 Best Alternative Routes You Need to Know

Palm Monorail: From iconic connector to maintenance standstill



Israel On HIGH ALERT As Trump ‘FINALISES’ US Attack On Iran Amid Bloody Khamenei Crackdown | Watch

What’s behind Palm Monorail's closure?



Extended maintenance resulting in major upgrades to stations, track infrastructure or vehicle systems.

Partial reopening first, serving select peak hours or routes before full reinstatement.

Integration with future transit plans, potentially tying to expanded urban transport networks like the Dubai Metro Red Line extensions (long-term conceptual plans have discussed broader connectivity between the Palm and mainland transit)

Dubai commuters adjust with alternatives



Taxis and Ride-Hailing Apps (Fastest and Most Convenient): Best for tourists, families, hotel guests, short stays, taxis remain the most direct and time-efficient option to reach hotels, beach clubs and attractions across Palm Jumeirah. They are widely available across Dubai with drop-off directly at Atlantis, The Pointe, Nakheel Mall and hotels. They are ideal during hot weather or peak tourist season. Tip: During weekends and evenings, allow extra time due to traffic at Palm entry points. RTA Buses (Budget-Friendly Option): Best for budget travellers and daily commuters, Dubai’s public buses continue to serve Palm Jumeirah and nearby areas. Bus routes connect Palm Gateway with Dubai Tram and Metro stations, have affordable fares using Nol cards and are reliable but slower than taxis. Tip: Expect longer travel times during peak hours, especially in winter tourism season. Dubai Tram and Taxi Combination (Balanced Option): Best for visitors staying near Dubai Marina or JBR, take the Dubai Tram to Palm Jumeirah Gateway and switch to a taxi for internal Palm travel. This option balances cost and convenience, especially for those already near tram routes. Private Cars and Hotel Shuttles (Most Flexible): These are best for residents, long-term visitors and hotel guests. Many hotels on the Palm offer complimentary shuttle services. Private cars allow flexibility but can face congestion at peak times. Parking is available at major attractions like Atlantis and Nakheel Mall. Tip: Check hotel shuttle schedules in advance to avoid waiting times. Water Transport (Scenic, Limited Availability): Best for leisure travellers, some operators offer water taxis and private boat services connecting the Palm with Marina or mainland Dubai. These are scenic and relaxing with limited routes and schedules but are typically more expensive than land transport

Key advice for travellers

Re-evaluate peak-day plans to allow extra travel time across Palm Jumeirah.

Use taxis or buses from Palm stations to reach Atlantis, Aquaventure and other attractions.

Check official social channels frequently, as operators have pledged to update passengers once service resumes. Follow official Palm Monorail channels for reopening updates.

Plan extra time for Palm journeys during weekends and evenings.

Check hotel transport options before booking taxis.

If visiting Atlantis or Aquaventure, taxis remain the simplest option





Dubai’s iconic Palm Monorail, the first monorail in the Middle East and a key people-mover on Palm Jumeirah Island, has suspended operations indefinitely for essential maintenance work, leaving locals and tourists alike in transit limbo as the route connecting the Palm to the mainland remains closed with no confirmed reopening date. The announcement came via the monorail’s official channels, with operators confirming that station maintenance is the reason behind the service stoppage. While riders and commuters await updates, alternative transport like taxis, buses and private vehicles have become the de facto way to traverse the popular destination.The Palm Monorail, which first opened in April 2009 and runs approximately 5.45 km across the famed Palm Jumeirah to Atlantis Aquaventure Resort, has served residents, hotel guests and visitors for over 16 years. Designed as a scenic and efficient link across the inland portion of the man-made island, it features four stations and was operated by UK-based transport firm Serco.This suspension marks one of the most significant disruptions to the fleet since its launch and critically, there is currently no timeline for service resumption. While the monorail has historically played a niche role in the city’s broader transit ecosystem (with other heavy traffic handled by road vehicles and the Dubai Metro), it has nonetheless been a memorable part of the Palm experience, often recommended by guides and included in visitor itineraries.According to official statements and travel reports, the shutdown is due to ongoing station maintenance across the monorail network. The operators emphasised that this maintenance is vital to ensure long-term efficiency and safety. It is a necessity for infrastructure nearing two decades of operation.However, there are no published details about the scope, duration or specific technical issues being addressed and a reopening date has not been announced. The lack of a firm timeline has caught many by surprise, including frequent riders and tourists planning visits during Dubai’s peak travel months.For tourists, the monorail was not only functional but scenic and offered elevated views of the Palm trunk, fronds and skyline beyond. Its absence removes one of the region’s most visually distinctive transport experiences, with many visitors now questioning whether a Palm Jumeirah visit will feel less complete without it.Dubai’s transport ecosystem continues to accommodate tens of thousands of daily commuters via roads, ferries, the Dubai Metro and buses, but the monorail’s suspension, especially without a reopening timeline, has created a sense of uncertainty for travel planners and local enthusiasts alike. Unlike typical ride or track refurbishments in theme parks or transit systems worldwide, where scheduled closures often come with reopening forecasts, Dubai’s monorail maintenance appears to be in a more fluid or potentially extensive phase.For instance, other major attractions that undergo periodic maintenance (such as aerial tramways elsewhere) often announce specific closure windows and reopening dates well in advance. The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway in California, for example, closed for its annual maintenance and clearly communicated both start and reparative timelines months before reopening.By contrast, the Palm Monorail closure has only been explained as a maintenance necessity, with no estimated timeline distributed so far. It is a situation that could hint at deeper or more unpredictable engineering work underway. There are a few possible scenarios for the Palm Monorail’s future:While operators have not issued such updates, Dubai’s dynamic urban growth suggests that transport infrastructure will continue to evolve, and the monorail, as a symbolic and strategic asset, may yet be refashioned to play a renewed role once technical work is complete.With Dubai’s Palm Monorail suspended indefinitely for maintenance, residents and visitors heading to Palm Jumeirah will need to rely on alternative transport options. Here’s a simple guide to the fastest, easiest and most practical ways to move around the Palm while the monorail remains out of service.Though these options maintain mobility, riders have noted longer transit times, especially during rush hours or high-season tourism peaks. Some social media users have expressed frustration at the lack of clarity about when the monorail might return, underscoring how the system is valued both as transport and as a leisure experience.For visitors planning Dubai itineraries in early 2026, the monorail closure means:The Palm Monorail, a once-celebrated urban transport highlight, is out of service for essential maintenance with no reopening date yet. The closure underscores both Dubai’s commitment to long-term safety and the challenges of sustaining ageing transport systems in a rapidly growing city.Though seemingly minor in the grand scheme of Dubai’s transport network, the monorail’s indefinite suspension stands as a reminder that iconic infrastructure sometimes needs serious upkeep and that even world-class cities must balance maintenance demands with high expectations from residents and visitors alike. While the Palm Monorail remains closed with no reopening date announced, Palm Jumeirah is still fully accessible.Taxis and buses are currently the most reliable alternatives, while tram links and hotel shuttles help bridge the gap. With a bit of planning, getting around the Palm remains smooth, even without its iconic monorail.","Dubai's iconic Palm Monorail has suspended operations indefinitely for essential maintenance work. The route connecting the Palm to the mainland remains closed with no confirmed reopening date. While riders and commuters await updates, alternative transport like taxis, buses and private vehicles have become the de facto way to traverse the popular destination.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126485510,imgsize-69004,width-400,resizemode-4/dubai-palm-monorail-suspended-indefinitely-for-maintenance-5-best-alternative-routes-you-need-to-know.jpg"
Kuwait extends newborn registration window to 120 days for Civil IDs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/kuwait-extends-newborn-registration-window-to-120-days-for-civil-ids/articleshow/126478222.cms,"Kuwait increases time limit to 120 days for baby registration / AI Illustration

Kuwait newborn registration 2026

Deadlines for citizens and expats

Kuwaiti Citizens: Must register within 30 days of returning to the country.



GCC Citizens: Have a 30-day window from the date of their arrival in Kuwait.



Expatriates: Must complete registration within 30 days of obtaining their residency permit.



Penalties for missing deadlines

Fines: Penalties for non-compliance range from KD 2,000 to KD 3,000.



Settlement Options: In some cases, a settlement can be reached by paying KD 100 plus an additional KD 5 for every day of delay (capped at KD 2,000).







Welcoming a new member into the family is a whirlwind of joy, sleepless nights, and, inevitably, paperwork. In a major move to support families, Kuwaiti authorities have officially extended the deadline for registering newborns in the national civil information system. New parents now have a generous 120-day window to complete their baby’s registration, a significant shift designed to ease the administrative burden during those precious first months.The update comes directly from Sheikh Fahad Al-Yousef, the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior, who also chairs the Public Authority for Civil Information (PACI). Under the new ministerial decision, the registration period for children born inside Kuwait has been pushed to four months from the date of birth.This change amends long-standing regulations to better reflect the logistical realities of modern parenting. By providing more time, the government aims to ensure that every child is documented accurately without forcing parents to rush through legal procedures while still recovering from childbirth or adjusting to a new routine.While the extension for newborns is the headline news, it is important to note that other registration deadlines remain strict. The Civil Information System serves as the backbone of Kuwait’s administrative data, and the Ministry of Interior maintains clear timelines for other categories of residents:These rules ensure that the national registry stays up to date, which is crucial for everything from healthcare planning to the distribution of public services.While the government is making the process more flexible, they are also getting tougher on those who ignore the law entirely. Recent legislative updates highlight that neglecting a child's documentation is no small matter. Failing to add a child to official nationality files or civil records can result in heavy financial hits:Authorities emphasize that these measures are about more than just bureaucracy; they are a commitment to child protection and the preservation of national identity. Ensuring a child has a Civil ID from the start guarantees their access to essential rights, including education and healthcare.This extension is part of a broader ""digital-first"" push in Kuwait. By streamlining how families interact with PACI and the Ministry of Health, the State is making it easier for citizens and residents to stay compliant. Parents are encouraged to utilize the Sahel app and other online portals to track their applications and ensure all document, such as attested marriage certificates and passports, are ready well within the new 120-day limit.","Kuwait has extended the deadline for registering newborns in the national civil information system.

“Supposed to be a secret”: Creepy 140-year-long YouTube upload is unsettling the internet for one chilling reason,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/supposed-to-be-a-secret-creepy-140-year-long-youtube-upload-is-unsettling-the-internet-for-one-chilling-reason/articleshow/126494547.cms,"A mysterious YouTube channel has gone viral after uploading a silent black screen video that appears to run for 140 years. The impossible runtime has sparked confusion, glitch theories, and conspiracy talk online. With millions of views and no clear explanation, the upload has left viewers unsettled and questioning how such a video could exist on the platform.

Netizens debate glitch, experiment, or something stranger

�





A strange upload has quietly taken over online conversations, not because of what it shows, but because of what it refuses to reveal. A pitch black screen. No sound. No movement. Yet millions have pressed play, confused and curious, as a single YouTube video displays a runtime that stretches far beyond reason. The silence has become the hook.Uploaded earlier this month by an account called @shinywr, the video appears to run for more than a century, according to its on screen duration. Viewers quickly noticed something felt off. It started as a harmless piece of boredom but now it has become a viral riddle, which attracted the response of tech-savvy people, conspiracy theorists, as well as just a regular scrolling crowd.When the video went viral, the social media was awash with speculation. Other users also cast doubt on the upload as being real. The confusion was described by one X user perfectly.""That’s bizarre, and it makes you wonder whether it’s a glitch, an experiment with the platform’s limits, or some kind of digital time capsule.""Others focused on YouTube’s technical limits. Verified accounts can only upload videos up to 12 hours long, which fueled doubts about the century long runtime. Another user offered a more technical explanation.""That video actually 12 hours 30 minutes 56 seconds. YouTube stores video duration as a number in milliseconds. If the uploader, encoder, or streaming manifest feeds YouTube a broken or deliberately overflowed value, the UI converts garbage math into absurd numbers like decades or centuries,""Not everyone saw it as a bug. Some viewers leaned into imagination and humor. One comment read, ""this is DEFINITELY the start of a conspiracy theory ppl are randomly gonna talk about 10 years later or something 😭😭,"" while another added, ""This is gonna have some insane lore in 10 years😭🥀🥀,""Digging deeper only raised more questions. The channel lists its location as North Korea, where YouTube is blocked. It also hosts another oddly titled upload suggesting hundreds of hours, though that video clocks in at just over 12 hours.Perhaps the most intriguing clue came from the uploader themselves, who wrote, ""why are my videos getting recommended to people? this channel was supposed to be a secret.""Whether glitch or deliberate experiment, the mystery shows how silence can still dominate the loudest platform on the internet.","A YouTube video that appears to run for 140 years has gone viral.

Rule #1: Clarify what you truly want

Rule #2: Go big with the right collaborations

Rule #3: Tell your story with courage



Chris Do at Dubai’s Billion Followers Summit

Why Chris Do's principles matter now more than ever



Know who you are before asking others to know you.

Choose collaborators who elevate your voice.

Tell your story boldly, beautifully and authentically.





At Dubai’s Billion Followers Summit, the world’s biggest event for digital creators, one of the leading voices in branding and design took to the stage with a clear message that in a crowded digital world, being different is not optional but essential.Chris Do, CEO and Founder of The Futur, a global creative education platform followed by millions, shared his top principles for content creators aiming to build a distinctive identity in an era where anyone with a phone can publish content. His session titled “How to Stand Out in a Noisy World” was one of the highlights of the fourth 1 Billion Followers Summit 2026 in Dubai, an event drawing tens of thousands of creators from around the world under the theme “Content for Good. ”Do’s first principle is deceptively simple: define precisely what you want before trying to build a public persona. In his view, clarity of intent serves as a magnetic force. Once you know your destination, your work naturally aligns with opportunities and audiences. Without that clarity, creators risk mimicking others and blending into the noise.“Don't expect everyone to know you. Instead, you should focus on building a distinctive personality that people will recognise.To build this distinctive personality, there are a number of assets or principles. The first is to define precisely what you want because if you do that, you will find that life organises things for you until you achieve what you want,” Do told the packed audience.The underlying idea here is that identity precedes audience, not the other way around. When creators are consistent in what they stand for, others are far more likely to gravitate toward them, not because their content is everywhere but because it matters somewhere. This kind of intentional positioning builds both followers and loyalty.Next, Do emphasised that the creators who want to make a mark should not shy away from associating with big names in their niche. Rather than playing it safe in isolated corners of the internet, ambitious creators should actively pursue collaborations with people, brands or platforms that already embody excellence in their field.This is not about ego or branding theatrics, it is about strategic visibility. When you align yourself with recognised authorities, your own voice gains credibility by association. For many content creators, the smartest next step is not more posting; it is more worthwhile partnerships.The third and most human of Do’s principles centres on storytelling. For a creator to stand out, audiences must first know you before they engage with what you create. In a world where trends and memes come and go, a creator’s unique story becomes their lasting currency.Do urged creators to have the courage to show opinions that differ from the mainstream, even if they seem strange or unconventional. However, he also stressed that difference must be meaningful, not different for the sake of attention. Authenticity, he argued, is the glue that connects form and substance, bold ideas with beautiful presentation.If your aesthetic and your values align, people don’t just follow you; they remember you. His point reflects a wider industry shift: audiences increasingly reward truth and depth over polished mimicry.Do’s session came against the backdrop of the 1 Billion Followers Summit’s explosive growth. With over 30,000 attendees, 15,000+ creators and 500+ expert speakers from around the world, the event underscores the creator economy’s evolving complexity and influence.As traditional media models continue to shift, with millions of videos uploaded daily and users spending hours on social platforms, creators are discovering that follower counts alone no longer guarantee success. The goal is no longer only visibility but distinctive influence and lasting connection. This idea is echoed by other speakers at the summit, who have urged creators to think beyond virality and focus on purpose, responsibility and real impact in their craft.For aspiring creators and seasoned influencers alike, Do’s framework offers a roadmap out of content fatigue and into meaningful growth:These principles are not tricks or shortcuts; they are foundations for a digital identity that withstands trends and algorithm changes, transforming creators from noise makers into distinctive voices in the global conversation. In a world where anyone can become a creator overnight, enduring influence is built not by copying what’s popular but by defining what’s you. As Chris Do put it in Dubai: clarity, collaboration and courageous storytelling are not just nice to have, they are the keys to standing out in an increasingly crowded world.","Chris Do, CEO and Founder of The Futur, shared his top principles for content creators aiming to build a distinctive identity in an era where anyone with a phone can publish content.

AI, Aircraft and Salt Crystals: How the UAE Is Boosting Rainfall

Cloud seeding myths, misunderstandings and real weather



How cloud seeding works

Bottom line







Even if you have never been to a desert, you would have seen it on screens, how rain bursts despite arid desert sun but in the UAE, rain does not just happen by chance. Behind the scenes, scientists are actively nudging clouds to drop more water, using aircraft, salt crystals, artificial intelligence and some of the world’s most advanced weather-tech. Yes, there is a real-world rain machine in one of the planet’s driest regions.Welcome to the UAE’s cloud-seeding programme, a long-running national effort to enhance rainfall in a place that normally gets less than 100 mm of rain a year.The concept is simpler than it sounds. The UAE does not create rain from thin air, it enhances rain that might already be there. Scientists constantly scan the skies using sophisticated weather radars and 26 live camera feeds to spot developing cumulus clouds with potential.When conditions look right, they are ready to act. From meteorological radar data to real-time cloud analysis, researchers identify the best moments and places to intervene, no crystal balls required.When suitable clouds form, specially equipped aircraft take to the skies. Pilots fly into the updrafts, rising currents of air within convective clouds and deploy seeding agents like microscopic salt crystals mixed with magnesium, sodium chloride and potassium chloride.These tiny particles act as condensation nuclei, meaning that they attract and cluster water droplets within the cloud. As droplets grow larger and heavier, gravity finally pulls them down as rainfall instead of letting them evaporate in the dry desert air.In 2025 alone, the UAE reported 172 cloud-seeding flights, aiming to boost rain, not create weather from nothing.Think cloud seeding is stuck in the last century? The truth is that the UAE has invested in cutting-edge innovations -Together, these upgrades are pushing cloud-seeding into a more efficient “rain-tech” arena rather than a simple aerial stunt.Studies and operational data suggest that cloud seeding can increase rainfall by roughly 10% to 25% under the right conditions and is significant when every extra drop counts. Some research even links cloud-seeded storms to larger volumes of water reaching the ground, with gains measured in hundreds of millions of cubic metres of usable water annually, a real lifeline in a region where water security is a top priority.Still, experts caution that cloud seeding is not a perfect rainmaker as it cannot produce rain unless clouds already have moisture and results can vary depending on atmospheric conditions. The UAE’s water challenges are real. Rapid urban growth and limited natural freshwater mean the country relies heavily on desalination plants, recycled water and cloud seeding to meet its needs.Cloud seeding is far more cost-effective than desalination for extra water as one flight costs around US $8,000 per hour, a bargain when compared to the energy and infrastructure required to turn seawater into drinking water. That is why the UAE has invested millions of dollars into research and technology, including local manufacturing of seed materials and international scientific partnerships.Despite its gains, cloud seeding sometimes gets blamed for extreme weather like the surprising flooding seen in parts of the Emirates. However, meteorologists are clear that cloud seeding cannot create storms out of nothing. Heavy rains during major weather events are natural phenomena that cloud seeding can neither trigger nor control.In social media discussions, some critics call cloud seeding “scam technology” or blame it for unexpected rainfall but even sceptics acknowledge that the programme generally only enhances rain when clouds already exist. Cloud seeding in the UAE is not about controlling nature, it is about coaxing nature to give a little extra.As climate change increases weather unpredictability and water scarcity pressures mount, experts see rain enhancement as one valuable tool among many. Whether it is planes, drones, nano-powder or AI pilots, the UAE’s cloud-seeding programme is a fascinating blend of technology, meteorology and environmental strategy. It is a uniquely desert-born experiment in making the sky work for people.The UAE’s effort to “make it rain” is not science fiction, it is a real, high-tech programme combining radar, planes, salts, nano-materials and AI to enhance rainfall in one of the driest climates on Earth. While it has limitations, cloud seeding represents a creative response to water scarcity, one that other water-stressed regions are watching closely.","In 2025 alone, the UAE reported 172 cloud-seeding flights, aiming to boost rain, not create weather from nothing.

The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true.

""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok. By Dec 19, most appeared to have been removed from the platform. Howard said the use of AI in politics is increasing rapidly. ""We know it's internationally pervasive now,"" he said. ""Four of every five elections around the world now have AI-generated political junk that is unattributed and clearly misleading.

It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough. A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126072870,imgsize-47970,width-400,resizemode-4/saving-and-investing.jpg"

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Your credit history influences your CIBIL score , which is calculated using a special method.Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity. Ranging from 300 to 900, a higher score indicates a stronger likelihood of loan approval. Banks and financial institutions use this score to assess the risk associated with lending money.1.

Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings



Posters, paperwork and early marketing

A wide-ranging collection of Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings and some of Apple’s earliest products has gone up for auction as the company approaches its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2026. The sale is being handled by RR Auction, which has opened bidding on 191 items spanning Jobs’ early life and Apple’s formative period in the mid-1970s.Among the centrepieces of the auction is the first known cheque issued by Apple Computer, Inc. on March 16, 1976. Signed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, the $500 cheque was made out to Howard Cantin, who designed the printed circuit board for the Apple-1 computer. The document predates Apple’s official incorporation and is described by the auction house as a foundational artefact from the company’s earliest days.Also drawing strong interest is the earliest known prototype motherboard for the Apple-1, alongside other rare hardware from Apple’s pre-Macintosh era. Early bidding has already pushed some items into the tens of thousands of dollars, with expectations that final prices could climb far higher.The auction also includes a functional Lisa-1 computer, a key transitional machine that preceded Apple’s Macintosh line, as well as a first-generation iPhone that was later jailbroken by teenage hacker George Hotz.Together, the items trace Apple’s evolution from a garage-based start-up to a consumer electronics giant.Adding a more personal dimension, the collection features items from Jobs’ childhood and teenage years, provided to the auction house by his stepbrother, John Chovanec. These include bowties, Bob Dylan 8-track tapes, and the wooden desk from Jobs’ bedroom at the Los Altos, California home later associated with the famed “Apple garage”.Other personal effects include components from Jobs’ own Apple-1 computer, hand-annotated car repair manuals, and a short handwritten note to his father on an early Apple business card.Rounding out the auction are original Apple marketing posters from the 1970s and 1980s, along with internal documents and ephemera from the company’s earliest phase. Together, the items offer a rare, material record of Apple’s origins and the personal world of its co-founder.Bidding for the collection is open until January 29, with interest expected to grow as the anniversary year approaches.","Collection of Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings and some of Apple’s earliest products has gone up for auction as the company approaches its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2026.

What is Dubai's Smart Rental Index?



Why are rent hikes in Dubai regulated in the first place?

Dubai Rent Increases Decoded: What Landlords Don’t Always Tell Tenants

How rent increase limits are calculated in Dubai



0% increase: If your current rent is up to 10% below the market average

5% increase: If it’s 11% to 20% below average

10% increase: If it’s 21% to 30% below average

15% increase: If it’s 31% to 40% below average

20% increase: If it’s more than 40% below average

Step-by-step: How to check if your rent increase is legal in Dubai



Visit the official DLD Rent Index page on the Dubai Land Department website. Enter your Title Deed number or manually key in your property details (area, number of rooms, contract expiry date and current annual rent). The tool calculates the average rent for similar properties nearby. It then shows the maximum legal rent increase allowed under the index bands.

What to do if your Dubai landlord demands too much



Present the official index result to the landlord in writing or via email.

Negotiate based on the legal maximum rather than the landlord’s figure.

File a complaint with the Rental Dispute Centre (RDC) at the Dubai Land Department, where the index can be used as statutory evidence to challenge unfair increases.

Bottom line: Rent transparency in Dubai







As Dubai’s rental market continues to evolve amid strong demand and population growth, tenants often grapple with rising rents and the question: Is this rent increase even legal ? Fortunately, the Dubai Land Department’s Smart Rental Index, an AI-powered official tool, now gives residents a clear way to check whether a rent hike proposed by a landlord is justified under UAE law.Whether you are renewing your lease, debating negotiations or simply planning your budget, understanding how rent hikes are regulated in Dubai is essential. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how the system works and how tenants can protect themselves from arbitrary increases.At the core of Dubai’s rent regulation framework is the Smart Rental Index, a sophisticated tool developed by the Dubai Land Department (DLD) to determine fair rental values across the emirate. Unlike the older system, which was updated annually by broad district averages, the Smart Index uses AI and detailed building-level data, including construction quality, services, maintenance standards and location, to produce real-time average rent figures for specific buildings and neighbourhoods.The index covers all residential areas of Dubai, including freehold communities and leasehold zones and helps both tenants and landlords benchmark rental rates against current market conditions.Under Dubai’s tenancy laws (including Decree No. 43 of 2013 and subsequent DLD regulations), landlords cannot arbitrarily raise rent each year. Instead, rent increases are permitted only during lease renewal and only if the Smart Rental Index supports the hike.Importantly, landlords must also provide tenants with a written notice at least 90 days before the expiry of the tenancy contract if they wish to raise rent or change any contract terms. Failing to provide this notice makes the increase invalid under the law, even if the index allows it.These rules are designed to promote market transparency and protect tenants from sudden, excessive rent hikes that could destabilise household finances.Dubai’s rent increase system sets strict limits on how much landlords can legally increase rent, based on how the tenant’s current rent compares with the average market rent shown in the Smart Rental Index -These bands help ensure that rent adjustments are fair and reflect genuine market trends rather than landlord discretion. They are automatically applied by the Smart Rental Index tool when you perform a legal rent check.Tenants in Dubai can easily verify whether a proposed rent increase complies with the official rules by using the online rent calculator provided by the Dubai Land Department:You can access this service via the Dubai REST app, the DLD website under e-services or the DubaiNow app, all of which provide the same official data. Once you have the result, you can print or screenshot the official calculation to use in negotiations with your landlord or, if needed, as evidence in a dispute.If your landlord proposes a rent increase that exceeds the legal limit shown by the Smart Rental Index or fails to give the mandatory 90-day notice, you have options:Tenants have successfully used this process to keep their rent at current levels when the index shows no increase is allowed, demonstrating the tool’s effectiveness.Even if the Smart Rental Index shows your rent qualifies for an increase, the landlord must still serve at least 90 days’ written notice before your tenancy expires. If they don’t, the increase is invalid by law and your rent must remain unchanged for the next contract period.This dual requirement, both index eligibility and timely notice, protects tenants from both unjustified and procedural rent hikes.The Smart Rental Index is not just a protective tool for tenants, it also helps landlords justify their pricing based on clear market data. This transparency can reduce conflicts and support fairer negotiation at renewal time.For tenants, the benefits are clear:For landlords, it standardises expectations and aligns increases with actual market trends, supporting sustainable rental growth across Dubai’s diverse property landscape.Dubai’s Smart Rental Index and the associated legal framework give tenants a powerful and free way to verify whether a rent increase is fair and lawful. Using the official online calculator and understanding the rules around notice periods and permissible increases allows renters to protect themselves from arbitrary hikes while helping landlords set rents that reflect genuine market data.With rent increases now a standard concern for tenants across the emirate, knowing how to use the Smart Rental Index could save tenants thousands of dirhams and reduce rental disputes. It is not just about checking numbers, it is about ensuring fairness, transparency and legal compliance in one of the world’s most dynamic rental markets.",Dubai’s rent increase system sets strict limits on how much landlords can legally increase rent.

OpenAI cofounder disagrees with CEO Sam Altman on AGI timeline





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently shared what he sees as a key test for the next stage of artificial intelligence (AI). As companies race to build AI agents that can act independently, Suleyman said he is watching for a milestone he calls Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI) on the path toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). He said that the test is simple in context but difficult in execution – whether an AI agent can legally take $1,00,000 and turn it into $1 million. He described the test as “modern turing test”, suggesting it will show how AI systems can plan, reason, make decisions and operate within real-word rules.“The next big milestone I'm watching for on our way to AGI: Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI). Can an agent take $100k and legally turn it into $1M? To me that's the modern Turing Test,” Mustafa Suleyman wrote in a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter).Suleyman’s comments come as several technology leaders including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff bet heavily on AI agents as the next major shift in enterprise software. Companies such as OpenAI, Salesforce, Microsoft and others are promoting agents that can carry out tasks with limited human input, from writing code to managing business workflows.Last year, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff called the rise of AI in the workforce a “digital labor revolution,” estimating that the software company has reached about 93% accuracy with the technology.In an interview with Bloomberg then, he revealed that AI is doing up to 50% of the work at Salesforce.In 2025, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicted that AI could soon automate up to 40% of the tasks humans currently perform. He also claimed that AGI could arrive before 2030.Recently, OpenAI cofounder and AI researcher Andrej Karpathy pushed back against the “agentic AI” hype, characterizing the current generation of autonomous AI systems as “slop.” Karpathy has directly challenged the notion that autonomous AI agents are on the cusp of delivering as promised, positioning himself in contrast to the optimistic timelines often suggested by figures like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.“I feel like the industry is making too big of a jump and is trying to pretend like this is amazing, and it’s not. It’s slop,"" Karpathy said on The Dwarkesh Podcast.“They’re not coming to terms with it, and maybe they’re trying to fundraise or something like that. We’re at this intermediate stage,” he added.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman proposes a new test for advanced AI: can an agent legally grow $100,000 into $1 million?

EXPOSED: Mark Zuckerberg Embarrassed on Hot Mic Admitting Total Confusion During Trump Dinner





Ever since Mark Zuckerberg announced the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs in first half of 2025, Meta CEO has been on an AI hiring blitz. A Twitter user who goes by the moniker @HinataMotivates, said to be a tech-motivation account, shared a podcast clip (going back to 2022) where Zuckerberg talks about Meta hiring rule and his advice for college students. Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone and the one that he says is also an important tip for any college student. In an episode of the “Lex Fridman Podcast,” hosted by MIT computer scientist Lex Fridman, Zuckerberg said that most people know Facebook ’s dorm-room origin story and that many have learned the wrong lesson from it. He said that his initial ability to launch Facebook wasn’t because he dropped out of college. According to Zuckerberg, it was due to the personal connections he made while he was still in school.Who you spend time with in college, Zuckerberg said, is “the most important decision” any student can make in college. He advised college students that choosing their social circle is the most pivotal decision, as people tend to emulate those around them. “You become the people you surround yourself with,” he said in the podcast.“I think probably people are too, in general, objective focused, and maybe not focused enough on the connections and the people who they’re basically building relationships [with]. ” Meta CEO Zuckerberg is said to have met his Facebook co-founders ⁠— Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes and Andrew McCollum ⁠— while the five were students at Harvard University.While the group split up in a not-so-happy manner, Zuckerberg said on the podcast that he tries to prioritize relationships over objectives. This applies especially to hiring. Zuckerberg said that he extends the idea to his Meta hiring philosophy: He only employs candidates he did hypothetically work for, underscoring reciprocity and alignment in professional networks. When evaluating a job candidate, he imagines what it would be like to work for that person. “I will only hire someone to work for me if I can see myself working for them,” he said.Mark Zuckerberg said that the strategy creates a work environment that’s both more cohesive and more productive: If you work with people who share your values on a human level, you’ll be more likely to smoothly achieve your work goals together. It’s all about finding personal compatibility, he said, not unlike “choosing friends or a partner.”","Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone.

Lawmakers in America want to ban AI toys; Lego says: Allow kids to …,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/lawmakers-in-america-want-to-ban-ai-toys-lego-says-allow-kids-to-/articleshow/126487466.cms,"Breaking the ""AI Panic Cycle""



K–2: Foundations of logic and computer science.

3–5: Introduction to machine learning models.

6–8: Advanced AI concepts and hands-on robotics.





As US lawmakers push to ban toys that have AI infused in them, The Lego Group is taking a different stand: allow kids to build their own understanding. The Danish toy giant has launched “Lego Education Computer Science & AI,” a curriculum designed to teach K–8 (from Kindergarten through 8th Grade, or ages 5 to 14) students about artificial intelligence (AI) through physical play and experimentation.The launch comes at a time when California senators consider a 4-year ban on AI chatbot toys following high-profile safety failures. Lego has a different take – it is moving away from chatbots in favour of offline learning tools.“Children have their own thoughts on how AI should be used, or how it shouldn’t be used. Let’s bring children into the conversation in an informed and empowered way,” said Andrew Sliwinski, head of product experience of LEGO Education, as per a report in Fastlane.The new kits are priced at $339.95 for a group of four students and they aim to bring AI literacy to the students. According to Sliwinski, current narratives either frame AI as an unstoppable threat or a technology that must be strictly banned. He thinks that both of these takes underestimate children's capabilities.“What both of those narratives are often missing is that children are capable. They have their own opinions and thoughts on AI and how it should and shouldn’t be used,” he added.Lego’s system is built for privacy as the curriculum works entirely offline. This means that no data leaves the classroom computer, and no private information is shared with Lego or third parties. The program is divided into three grade bands:It is to be noted that Mattel – the toy company that has launched products like Barbie, Hot Wheels, and UNO, among others – failed to deliver an AI-powered toy in 2025 under its partnership with OpenAI. Another AI-enabled teddy bear was banned after it engaged in sexually explicit conversations with minors.","Lego Education Computer Science & AI curriculum designed to teach K–8 (from Kindergarten through 8th Grade, or ages 5 to 14) students about artificial intelligence.
