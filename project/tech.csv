Keeping your customers satisfied is more of a survival strategy in Schedule 1 than a goal. The use of appropriate mixing formulae for the best Strains is crucial.

While players might question whether other could have become the game's top earners since the patch, such as Green Crack, the general consensus is that OG Kush is still the best strain in schedule one. This strain gives the consumers anti-gravity and glowing effects.$165 base, up to $200 with negotiationsThis strain has a 100% Addiction rating, making it among the highest rated in the game.

“It is a must”: Shaquille O'Neal’s ex Shaunie Henderson has all the keys to a successful marriage with Pastor Keion Henderson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/it-is-a-must-shaquille-oneals-ex-shaunie-henderson-has-all-the-keys-to-a-successful-marriage-with-pastor-keion-henderson/articleshow/119413042.cms,"Shaquille O'Neal, Shaunie Henderson and Keion Henderson.

Shaunie Henderson and her husband Pastor Keion Henderson explain their successful marriage



Shaquille O'Neal ’s ex, Shaunie Henderson is happily married to Pastor Keion Henderson . The couple, who lead Houston’s Lighthouse Church and Ministries, have built a strong foundation by prioritizing their relationship amidst their busy lives. In a recent chat with Madame Noire, Shaunie, and Keion shared intricate details of their marriage and how they keep their relationship afloat with certain key pointers.As Pastor Keion Henderson explains, managing multiple responsibilities is essential. “We all have to manage multiple things,” he told Madame Noire. “You must manage yourself; if you have a significant other, you must manage that... Everybody has to be multi-faceted.”Outside influences don’t define their marriage. “We recognize that the Internet is not our relationship. The church is not our relationship. People’s opinions, they are not our relationship. We met each other. We chose this journey together and did what we had to stay on the original ship. We don’t let water in the ship,” Keion explains, adding that constant communication and grace are key to their success. Shaunie Henderson values advice from a trusted mentor who told her, “One of the things that I hold dear is that she says not to meet anyone’s expectations. Because once you meet one, there’ll be another one, and there’ll be another one after that, and you will never meet it and just be disappointing yourself and performing.”Defining marriage on their terms is crucial to the Hendersons. “Just because I’m a pastor and just because she’s a First Lady, that doesn’t mean that your faith isn’t tested,” Keion shares. “My definition of marriage is the collision of two histories… And sometimes compatibility isn’t the outcome.” They believe that open communication is essential. “We try to have a designated day that we sit down and talk, but with our life, travel, and schedule, that day and time can change,” Shaunie added.Knowing when to step away is another lesson they’ve learned in their marriage. “Our approach has been twofold. No. 1, communicate. No. 2, step away,” Keion reveals. “We’ll give each other some time to think about it and then come and talk.” Keion, author of Lazy Love: Recognizing and Reversing the 4 Threats to Any Successful Relationship, explains, “As I understand you, you understand me. I trust the outcomes that we both come away with… We always come together stronger than ever.”Faith remains the core of their union. “It is a must,” Shaunie asserts. “As women, we need to feel safe, and once you feel safe, you’re OK with being vulnerable… Having a spiritual component in your marriage is another layer of safety.” Keion adds that faith offers reassurance, saying, “I want folks to feel like they are overcomers… that they can manage their children and their businesses and their relationships.”Also Read: ""It's less physical"": Shaquille O'Neal weighs in on LeBron James' career amid injury controversy Shaunie was previously married to NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal. The former couple share four children together— sons Shareef and Shaqir, and daughters Amirah and Me'arah. The NBA Hall of Famer and Shaunie are co-parenting their kids and have been very supportive of them. Additionally, last year Shaunie shared that she and Shaq are currently on good terms.

Create Ghibli-style Eid images using AI



Step 1: Decide on the Eid scene you want to create

1. Crescent moon and starry night

The sighting of the Shawwal crescent moon marks the beginning of Eid.

You can generate an image featuring a glowing crescent moon in a deep blue sky, with lanterns or a peaceful village below.

2. Family gatherings

Depict a warm, cozy indoor scene where family members are dressed in traditional Eid attire, sharing a meal or exchanging gifts.

Add details like a decorated Eid table with traditional dishes like biryani, kebabs, sweets, and tea.

3. Eid prayer at a grand mosque

Illustrate a majestic mosque with glowing lights and people gathering for prayer.

Include soft sunlight filtering through the clouds, creating a peaceful and spiritual effect.

4. Children receiving Eidi

Create an image of children joyfully receiving Eidi (money or gifts) from elders.

You can add playful elements like balloons, sweets, and bright festival decorations.

5. A Ghibli-style Eid feast

Ghibli movies are famous for their detailed food illustrations, so you can generate a delicious Eid feast with steaming plates of traditional dishes, tea, and desserts.

Step 2: Generate the Ghibli-Style Eid image using AI

Option 1: Generate an image from a text prompt

Open an AI art generation tool that supports Ghibli-style rendering.

Enter a detailed prompt describing your Eid scene. Example prompt: ""A warm and colorful Ghibli-style illustration of a family celebrating Eid in a cozy room, sharing food, with soft lighting and a decorated table. The atmosphere is peaceful and magical.""

Adjust settings such as color tones, lighting, and artistic details to match the Ghibli aesthetic.

Generate the image and refine it if necessary.

Option 2: Transform an existing photo into Ghibli style

Upload a personal Eid photo to an AI-powered image transformation tool.

Apply a Ghibli-style filter or enhancement, adjusting lighting, softness, and colors to mimic hand-drawn art.

Fine-tune the details by adding warm tones, soft shadows, and watercolor-like textures.

Save the final image in high resolution.

Step 3: Enhance and personalize your image

1. Adjust colours and lighting

Ghibli films have a signature soft glow with warm and pastel tones.

Increase brightness and saturation to make the image more vibrant.

Add a slight blur or watercolor effect to give it a hand-painted look.

2. Add text and Eid greetings

Overlay your image with festive Eid messages such as: ""Eid Mubarak! Wishing you love, peace, and happiness."" ""May this Eid bring joy and prosperity to you and your family!""



3. Insert extra details

Add stars, lanterns, or Islamic geometric patterns to the background.

If it’s a food-related scene, include steam rising from dishes for an animated effect.

If it’s a mosque scene, enhance the glowing lights and crescent moon reflection.

Step 4: Share your Ghibli-style Eid image with family and friends

1. Send as a digital Eid greeting card

2. Post on social media

Upload your artwork to Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, or X (Twitter).

Use festive hashtags like #EidMubarak, #GhibliEid, #EidArt, #AIArt to connect with others.

Some users are also turning their Eid images into short animated GIFs or reels.

3. Print and gift the artwork (optional)

Print your Ghibli-style Eid image and frame it as a personalized Eid gift.

Use it as a custom Eid greeting card for family members.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.
