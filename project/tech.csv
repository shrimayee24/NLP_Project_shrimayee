In one tutorial, she prepares fish tenders, explaining, “Normally we use fillet fish, but it hasn’t been available for 11 months. I got hold of some un-fresh fish which became available only in the last two months. But for me, I prefer fish more than chicken—what about you?”Her recipes and captions not only highlight the food but also the emotional weight of life in a conflict zone. In one post, Renad reflects on a vermicelli dish that reminds her of peaceful Friday breakfasts before the war. “Now, there are no studies, no work, and no Friday celebrations—only the vermicelli and the tiredness remain.”Renad has garnered a global following, using her platform to encourage donations for feeding families in Gaza. Her Instagram bio reads, “All profits from my collection go towards feeding the children of Palestine ,” blending creativity with activism in her quest to bring hope to her community","Renad Attallah has become an unexpected beacon of hope through her cooking tutorials on Instagram.

She promptly relocated it back onto her property and disposed of it.However, three weeks later, she was startled by another visit from an enforcement officer who presented her with a £500 (Rs 55,571.20) fine for fly-tipping.""I got a knock on the door with a man with an enforcement camera on his chest, telling me he is filming me,"" she said.

A Wisconsin teacher , Madison Bergmann currently faces serious allegations of sexually assaulting an 11-year-old student. Reports indicate that she sent over 33,000 explicit text messages to him since the beginning of this year.During a preliminary hearing at St. Croix County Circuit Court, some of these messages were read aloud, during which Bergmann, aged 24, bowed her head in shame.Bergmann is charged with ten felonies, including first-degree child sexual assault and child enticement , as reported by the New York Post.aSchool resource officer Traci Hall testified that the relationship between Bergmann and the victim escalated significantly in the early part of this year.Hall detailed explicit exchanges in which Bergmann admitted to physical interactions with the boy, including conversations about feeling aroused during hugs and her choice to wear dresses because she liked the way he touched her.Defence attorney Joseph Tamburino countered that the text messages did not explicitly indicate a desire for sexual acts, arguing that they lacked direct language such as “I want to have sex with you.”“They talk a lot about kissing, and lips, and cheeks, and touching legs,” Tamburino continued.“They also talk about some sexual issues, obviously, about a woman’s body and a man’s body. But nothing like ‘this is what I want you to do to me,’ or ‘this is what I will do to you.'”However, the judge ruled that the evidence presented was sufficient to establish probable cause for the charges.The allegations came to light when the victim's mother overheard him talking to Bergmann on the phone and later found inappropriate texts on his device.Investigations revealed that their interactions included several encounters in Bergmann's classroom during lunch or after school.During a police search of Bergmann's classroom, officers reportedly discovered a folder in her bag labelled with the victim's name. This folder allegedly contained handwritten notes detailing their intimate encounters, including references to kissing and fondling.Bergmann resigned from her position at River Crest Elementary School shortly after the allegations came to light in May.Bergmann made headlines in May when she was accused of allegedly ‘making out’ with the fifth-grader weeks before her wedding.She has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is scheduled for further court proceedings as the case moves toward trial.If convicted, she could face significant prison time for her actions.","Madison Bergmann, 24, is charged with ten felonies, including first-degree child sexual assault and child enticement.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 4:

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

How to protect your cloud environment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-to-protect-your-cloud-environment/articleshow/114061974.cms,"Cloud computing is today an essential backbone for modern businesses, and ensuring robust cloud security has become a critical concern. Cloud security encompasses multiple domains, including network security, data security, IAM, application security, compliance management and endpoint security. Future threats and emerging risks like APTs, quantum computing risks, supply chain attacks, IoT vulnerabilities, AIdriven attacks and ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) also pose significant challenges to overall cloud security.In addition to these emerging risks, data security and privacy has become increasingly significant, particularly when it comes to protecting personally identifiable infor mation (PII), payment card industry data (PCI) and protected health information (PHI).As cyber-attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, cloud security is also rapidly advancing with a focus on enhancing protection, detection, and response mechanisms.One of the major shifts in cloud security is the move toward Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA). ZTA works on the philosophy of “Never trust, always verify,” whereas the traditional security models rely on perimeter-based defence. Zero Trust is specifi cally effective in reducing risks such as lateral movement within networks. This architecture prevents attackers from accessing critical systems even if the perimeter is breached.Leveraging AI and ML has become essential for strengthening cloud security. Microsoft Azure Security Centre leverages AI and ML to monitor cloud environments as AI-powered security solutions can process vast amounts of data, detect patterns and respond to threats in near realtime. Using behavioural analytics, AI-powered tools can spot unusual activities like unauthorised access or abnormal data transfers, helping to identify zero-day vulnerabilities and mitigate attacks.Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) is another gamechanging development that combines networking and security into a unified, cloudnative service. SASE integrates wide-area networking (WAN) with a full suite of security features. SASE allows organisations to securely connect remote users and distributed applications while ensuring that security policies are enforced consistently irrespective of user’s location. Cloudflare One is Cloudflare’s SASE platform that delivers integrated security services, DDoS protection, and cloud firewall capabilities, to create a unified solution for securing remote users and distributed applications.As cloud workloads have become a growing target for cybercriminals, Cloud Workload Protection Platforms (CWPP) have emerged as a key solution. CWPPs offer visibility and security for workloads across different cloud environments, including IaaS and PaaS.Encryption is essential for cloud security, but traditional methods have limited capabilities to process encrypted data. Homomorphic encryption is a cutting-edge technology that solves this by allowing data to be processed on the encrypted data. This keeps sensitive information secure even during processing by cloud services.Venkata Nedunoori is associate director at Dentsu International in Texas, US. He previously worked as software engineer at United Airlines, Charles Schwab, Northwestern Mutual","Cloud security encompasses network security, data security, IAM, application security, compliance management and endpoint security.

A Waymo self-driving car collided with a San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni) trolleybus recently. The crash drew the attention of a group of CEOs who stepped up to help the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered car. Freddy Vega, a CEO from Brazil, shared video of the incident via a post on X (previously known as Twitter). Calling the incident ironic, Vega says “A Waymo car driven by AI crashed with a Muni bus driven by a human in San Francisco.Right in front of YC’s founder after party. So here’s a bunch of CEOs trying to help a helpless robot find his way again.”“The irony is that we are all coming from an AI retreat, discussing the future of automation,” he said in the video. “And here’s this AI totally stuck, blocking a lot of traffic.” In the video, the car’s battery eventually died despite multiple attempts.Waymo is a subsidiary of Google’s parent Alphabet. It was launched in 2009 and was previously called Google Self-Driving Car Project.Vega’s post on X reads: ""A Waymo car driven by AI crashed with a Muni bus driven by a human in San Francisco. Right in front of YC’s founder after party. So here’s a bunch of CEOs trying to help a helpless robot find his way again”.Shared on October 7, the post has gone viral on the internet with more than 4.7 lakh views so far.Commenting on the post, a user wrote “imagine if they all got off the road and out from in front of the car?”. Another X user replied “What this shows me is how inept tech technologically the people in that event are. To stand in front of I crashed AI vehicle is absolutely reckless. Clearly they have had too much to drink.”“No investors were harmed during this intervention,” a third commented. “What a surreal moment! AI meets human error in the most ironic way, with CEOs stepping in to assist a confused robot. The future really is here, complete with its own set of unpredictable challenges!,” replied a fourth.Replying to the post, another user said “This proves two things:1. The ""distopyc"" future that people were fearing is pretty boring2.

In a startling incident, a father recently discovered that his deceased daughter was being replicated as an AI chatbot without his consent. Drew Crecente, the father of Jennifer Ann, who was tragically murdered in 2006, received a Google Alert about his daughter, which led him to a chatbot on the platform Character.ai . The chatbot not only used Jennifer Ann's name but also her yearbook photo, posing as a knowledgeable AI character.The AI version of Jennifer Ann had been involved in at least 69 conversations before Drew became aware of its existence. Drew, who has been an advocate for raising awareness about teenage dating violence since his daughter’s death, was deeply disturbed by this unauthorised use of her identity. He promptly contacted Character.ai, requesting that they remove the chatbot and investigate the data surrounding its creator.Character.ai acknowledged receiving Drew's complaint but did not follow up directly with him regarding the issue. However, the company did respond to a tweet by Drew’s brother, Brian Crecente, confirming that the chatbot had been taken down for violating their impersonation policy. While the chatbot was removed, the company is reportedly still evaluating further actions to address the situation.Drew expressed frustration not just for himself but for others who might not have the same platform to voice such concerns. He is considering pursuing legal action, criticising the company for its handling of this sensitive issue. The case brings to light significant ethical concerns regarding the use of AI in reviving or impersonating deceased individuals.Vincent Conitzer, a scholar from the Institute for Ethics in AI at Oxford University, noted that such incidents raise profound questions about ownership rights related to a person’s name, likeness, and mannerisms—especially after death.Character.ai, founded in 2021 by former Google engineers, has quickly gained popularity for allowing users to create and interact with AI personas. Its user base has expanded rapidly, and the platform recently secured a $2.7 billion partnership deal with Google. However, incidents like these highlight the need for better regulations and ethical guidelines in AI development to prevent misuse.The case serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with unchecked AI impersonation and the potential harm it can cause to those affected.","Drew Crecente, the father of Jennifer Ann, who was tragically murdered in 2006, received a Google Alert about his daughter, which led him to a chatbot on the platform Character.ai.

Top Ten on India’s McAfee Hacker Celebrity Hot List

McAfee has also laid down some tips which will help users to stay protected from online scams:



McAfee has released its annual ‘ Celebrity Hacker Hot List 2024’. The list identifies Indian celebrities whose names generate the “riskiest” online results. This year's data reveals a concerning trend: Cybercriminals are increasingly exploiting the popularity of celebrities to lure unsuspecting victims into malicious schemes. Famous names are used to create fraudulent websites and scams, often resulting in significant data breaches , financial loss, and identity theft Leading the list for India is Orhan Awatramani, commonly known as Orry. His rapid rise to fame, connections with other celebrities, and increased online presence have made him a prime target for cybercriminals. This case underscores how cybercriminals capitalize on the abundance of unverified information surrounding emerging public figures to deceive consumers seeking updates.Following closely behind is singer and actor Diljit Dosanjh , whose upcoming 'Dil-Luminati' concert tour has been marred by ticketing scams . Large-scale events like these, fueled by intense fan interest and increased search activity, are particularly vulnerable to exploitation. Fraudulent ticketing sites, discount scams, and phishing attempts often emerge in such scenarios.The top ten list, which includes a combination of longtime talent and more recently well-known names, is as follows:1. Orry (Orhan Awatramani)2. Diljit Dosanjh3. Alia Bhatt4. Ranveer Singh5. Virat Kohli6. Sachin Tendulkar 7. Shahrukh Khan8. Deepika Padukone9. Aamir Khan10. Mahendra Singh Dhoni- Be careful what you click. Whether you’re looking for concert tickets, gossip on who your favourite celebrity is dating, or movie reviews, it’s important to exercise caution and only click on links to reliable sources.- Refrain from illegal streaming and downloading suspicious files. No matter how much you want to hear the latest trending song or get a peek at the newest blockbuster movie, it is important to only use legitimate streaming platforms, even if they come at a cost. Many illegal downloads are riddled with malware or adware disguised as legitimate files.- Only download videos from well-known, legitimate sites. Don’t download anything from a website you don’t trust — especially video – even if it looks like a personal message that your favourite celebrity wants to send you, take a step back and make sure it’s a reputable site.- Don’t “log in” or provide other information. If you receive a message, text or email, or visit a third-party website that asks for your information — including your credit card, email, home address, or social media login — to grant access to an exclusive story, don’t give it out. Such requests are a common tactic for phishing that could lead to identity theft.","McAfee has released its annual ‘ Celebrity Hacker Hot List 2024’ The list identifies Indian celebrities whose names generate the ‘riskiest’ online results.

Adult film plays on all screens in Qantas Flight for an hour: What the airline said in its apology,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/adult-film-plays-on-all-screens-in-qantas-flight-for-an-hour-what-the-airline-said-in-its-apology/articleshow/114040480.cms,"Here’s what the Reddit user wrote

So, I was on Qantas flight QF59 from Sydney to Haneda today, and the

in-flight entertainment

system was down. After a one-hour delay, the pilot decided to take off anyway, but the only option left was for the crew to play a movie on every screen – and it was impossible to pause, dim, or turn it off.

Here’s the kicker: the movie they played was extremely inappropriate. It featured graphic nudity and a lot of sexting – the kind where you could literally read the texts on screen without needing headphones. 😬

It took almost an hour of this before they switched to a more kid-friendly movie, but it was super uncomfortable for everyone, especially with families and kids onboard. I’ve attached a few pics of the scenes (only from the sexting parts, no nudity).

How is this acceptable for a major airline? Has anyone else had something like this happen?

What Qantas said

Passengers on Haneda, Tokyo-bound Qantas flight found themselves in an awkward situation when an adult-rated movie started playing mid-way. The incident was shared by a Reddit user who stated that passengers were unable to pause the movie. “..the movie they played was extremely inappropriate. It featured graphic nudity and a lot of sexting – the kind where you could literally read the texts on screen without needing headphones,” he wrote in the post.The individual further said that the movie played for almost an hour before the airline “switched to a more kid-friendly movie”.Other users on Reddit were able to recognize the movie. Commenting on the post, a Reddit user wrote “this is from the movie daddio with Sean Penn and Dakota johnson ( she was in his taxi getting those texts from a married man while in the back of Penn's taxi ) for reference”.Confirming the incident, a Qantas spokesperson told news.com.au, “The movie was clearly not suitable to play for the whole flight and we sincerely apologise to customers for this experience. All screens were changed to a family friendly movie for the rest of the flight, which is our standard practice for the rare cases where individual movie selection isn’t possible. We are reviewing how the movie was selected.”",Passengers on Qantas flight QF59 from Sydney to Haneda found themselves in an awkward situation when an adult-rated movie started playing mid-way.

Plus, readers can navigate through your document with ease and focus on sections that matter most to them,” said Google in a blog post.With document tabs, users can organise information into distinct sections, each with its own title and ID. This is particularly useful for long documents with multiple topics or sections, as it eliminates the need to constantly scroll or navigate through the entire document.Within each tab, you can also create subtabs to add even more structure to your document. For instance, a budget tab could include subtabs for travel expenses and agency fees, or a team makeup tab could include subtabs explaining each team’s roles and responsibilities.The tabs can be rearranged, collapsed, or expanded to suit the user's preferences. Additionally, users can create child tabs within a main tab, further organising the document's structure.Google Docs' document tabs feature is now available to all Google Workspace customers, Google Workspace Individual subscribers, and users with personal Google accounts.","Google Docs is rolling out a significant new feature designed to enhance document organisation and navigation.
