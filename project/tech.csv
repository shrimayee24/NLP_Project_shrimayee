Marriage apps in Pakistan challenge traditional 'rishta aunties',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/marriage-apps-in-pakistan-challenge-traditional-rishta-aunties/articleshow/114491653.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: Lexica AI)

In Pakistan, the traditional matchmaking system is facing competition from marriage apps specifically designed for Muslims. These apps are being adopted as an alternative to the longstanding tradition of using "" rishta aunties ,"" or matchmakers, who facilitate arranged marriages .Ezza Nawaz, a textile designer in Lahore, decided to try an app after witnessing a friend's successful marriage through an online introduction .""When I saw my colleague happy after being married to someone she met online... I thought, since we have tried rishta aunties for four or five years, let's try this too,"" she told AFP. Nawaz married Waseem Akhtar just three months after meeting him on an app called Muzz.Traditionally, rishta aunties prepare women and present them to potential suitors' families in Pakistan, where dating is often seen as dishonorable. More than 80% of Pakistani marriages are arranged, according to a Gallup and Gilani Pakistan survey, with families taking the lead in deciding unions.Despite offering features like the option to blur profile pictures and providing message transcripts to a relative, marriage apps still face stigma, according to an AFP report. They are seen by some as comparable to casual dating apps like Tinder, which is banned in Pakistan.Waseem Akhtar, married to Nawaz, admits to being discreet when discussing their meeting. ""I do not tell people how I met my wife until I am sure that the person would not judge us,"" he said.In Pakistani culture, marriage is viewed as an alliance between families, and choosing a spouse independently is seen as challenging traditional structures. Rida Fatima, who used a rishta auntie, found the advice limiting and invasive. She was told to list ""cooking and cleaning"" as her hobbies instead of her interests like hiking and photography. ""They had the audacity to talk about how I looked, what I did, how much I earned, who my family is, how many brothers I have, and what my future aspirations are. So every little thing is judged,"" she said.Marriage apps continue to rise in popularity, with 1.2 million Pakistanis signing up since the launch of some apps last year, according to an AFP report. Despite this, traditional matchmaking remains strong, reflecting deep-rooted cultural practices . Matchmaker Fauzia Aazam dismisses marriage apps, stating, ""People waste time on these apps. Chatting together all through the night, I just don't like it.""Feminist author Aisha Sarwari points to control issues in the traditional matchmaking process and suggests a balanced approach. ""I would say that we need to find a good middle ground, where the respect is equal on both sides and there is no sense of demeaning a human being just because they look a certain way or they are from a particular race,"" she said.Aneela, a digital media artist, experienced different challenges on marriage apps. She found men lying on profiles and admitted to using fake details herself to avoid being identified. Eventually, she considered returning to arranged marriage options.","More than 80% of Pakistani marriages are arranged, according to a Gallup and Gilani Pakistan survey.

Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

This added layer ensures the safety of NPS transactions and protects the interests of subscribers and stakeholders.The login process for NPS CRAs is changing.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Leaked iPhone SE 4 images hint at iPhone 14-like design,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/leaked-iphone-se-4-images-hint-at-iphone-14-like-design/articleshow/114411596.cms,"Image courtesy: Macotakara

Images of alleged iPhone SE 4 dummy units have surfaced online, sparking speculation about the upcoming budget phone 's design and potential for a larger size option.The images, shared by Japanese tech blog Macotakara, showcase dummy units resembling the recently released iPhone 14 . This suggests the iPhone SE 4 could ditch the older design language in favour of a more modern look, featuring flat edges, a smaller notch for the Face ID system, and a single rear camera.The dummy units reportedly have the same dimensions as the current iPhone SE (146.7mm x 71.5mm x 7.8mm), hinting at a familiar form factor. However, the report also mentions the existence of a larger dummy unit, potentially hinting at an "" iPhone SE 4 Plus "" variant with a size similar to the iPhone 14 Plus (6.7-inch display).While Macotakara acknowledges that the existence of a Plus size option is unconfirmed, the possibility has piqued the interest of fans who may favour a larger display on a budget-friendly iPhone.It's important to note that these are leaks based on dummy units, not official confirmation from Apple. While the iPhone 14-inspired design seems likely, the existence of a Plus size model remains unverified.Apple is typically tight-lipped about upcoming products, so fans will need to wait for an official announcement to know for sure what the iPhone SE 4 will look like and what features it will offer.","Images of alleged iPhone SE 4 dummy units have surfaced online.

Apple co-founder Steve Jobs talked about AI 40 years ago: Here’s a video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-co-founder-steve-jobs-talked-about-ai-40-years-ago-heres-a-video/articleshow/114403621.cms,"This is what is he talks about AI

And so we’re finding the way we’ve built computers in the past isn’t working for the kinds of things we want to do in the future. And we’re examining new architectures, these fancy words like non–von Neumann machines, etcetera. And what we’re doing is we’re starting to look to the human brain. How is the human brain architected? And we’re finding that computers are very good at doing very simple things extremely accurately. And the human mind is very good at doing very complex things adequately. And there’s a ton of people now starting to look to the brain as a model of an architecture to build a computer.

The main differentiation that exists now between the two machines, and I’m going to use the word “machine” to describe the brain for a moment, is that man is self-conscious, obviously. We are conscious that we’re conscious: “I am thinking.” And to our knowledge, no computer or any even of the high primates has yet to say, “I am thinking.”

And so a tremendous amount of work is going on in the artificial intelligence community to try to understand what self-consciousness is, to try to understand if a computer can ever be self-conscious. But I think the biggest thing that motivates a lot of us is, unlike what we just heard, we don’t know. We honestly don’t know whether we are more than just a machine.

And we are building better and better computers. We’re running up against roadblocks. A lot of people are spending the best parts of their lives right now to try to understand the architecture of the brain and how we can make better and better machines to emulate it. And I actually think, by the end of our lifetimes, we’re going to know the answer to this question. And that’s what’s driving a lot of us.

While artificial intelligence as a technology may have picked up steam after the launch of ChatGPT two years ago, the concept is far from new. Apple founder Steve Jobs , a visionary in the tech world, predicted the potential of AI as far back as 40 years ago, envisioning machines that may answer questions and think like humans.On the Steve Jobs Archive , there’s footage from 1983 in which Jobs is talking to people at the International Design Conference in Aspen.The old video shows what Jobs thought about computers at that time, how books may be replaced by computers one day and the amount of work that is being done to understand the architecture of the brain to help machines emulate it.You can watch the video and a bunch of others using this link",Apple founder Steve Jobs predicted the potential of AI as far back as 40 years ago.

Never download apps from unknown sources.

Be wary of requests for facial recognition or unusual verification methods.

Do not share sensitive information like credit card details or OTPs with strangers.

If unsure about lounge access procedures, contact the airport authorities directly.

A woman traveling through Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru became the victim of an elaborate scam, losing over Rs 87,000 in a fraud scheme linked to lounge access.The woman, identified as Bhargavi Mani, shared her ordeal in a now-viral video, raising awareness about the deceptive tactics employed by scammers. Mani explained that she couldn't find her physical credit card, so she tried to enter the airport lounge by presenting a photo of the card to the staff.Instead of traditional verification methods, the lounge staff reportedly directed Ms.Mani to download a specific app and complete a facial scan for ""security purposes."" Trusting the staff, Mani downloaded the app, later identified as ""Lounge Pass."" However, she opted not to use the lounge and decided to grab coffee at Starbucks instead.Later, Mani noticed she was unable to receive phone calls, initially attributing it to network issues. However, the situation turned alarming when she realised strangers were answering her calls. Upon investigation, Ms. Mani discovered unauthorised transactions totalling over Rs 87,000 had been made on her credit card, transferred to a PhonePe account.She suspects the downloaded app was a malware program that allowed the scammers to access her phone, redirect her calls, and intercept one-time passwords (OTPs) used for online transactions. Mani has since reported the incident to the cybercrime department, alerted her bank, and blocked her credit card to prevent further losses.","Bhargavi Mani lost over Rs 87,000 in a fraud scheme linked to lounge access.

WWE RAW ’s General Manager, Adam Pearce has finally agreed for a match between Seth Rollins and “Big” Bronson Reed , at “Crown Jewel”. This development took place after a massive brawl ensued between Rollins and Bronson on RAW earlier this week. With the two highly aggressive individuals set to collide at Crown Jewel , the WWE Universe ponders about the match type, or the stipulations that could be added to the match to make it even more explosive, especially considering the high animosity between the two stars.So, here are three stipulation that could be added to the Seth Rollins versus Bronson Reed match at Crown JewelAlthough the WWE is reluctant to have two Hell in a Cell matches in consecutive Premium Live Events, this feud is starting to become worthy of changing that norm. After Rollins was attacked brutally by Bronson, a few months ago, Seth had to take a break and recover from the injuries. After recovering from the injuries, Rollins returned to settle the score and cost Bronson the “Last Monster Standing” match against Braun Stroman, on RAW. After that, Rollins has been hellbent on having a match against Reed, which he has finally been granted after a massive melee between the two. So, it is fast becoming necessary to add the “Hell in a Cell” spice in this feud, to make it even more grand and destructive.As mentioned earlier, WWE is mostly reluctant to have two Hell in a Cell matches in consecutive Premium Live Events. This is due to the fear of being repetitive or boring. Therefore, the Steel Cage match becomes the perfect replacement of a Hell in a Cell match as it is equally dangerous, if not more. The steel cage has witnessed few of the most violent and brutal battles between WWE superstars and this match already promises to deliver on these adjectives. Rollins’ experience and aggression against Reeds’ unabashed thirst for violence, coupled with the steel cage around them. This could be massive in terms of entertainment and the crowd getting their money’s worth.Adding the “Last Man Standing” match stipulation to this match at Crown Jewel, would be poetic justice. As we witnessed, Rollins returned after the injury to cost Reed his Last Monster Standing match(a variation of the Last Man Standing match), against Braun Strowman by delivering a brutal Curb Stomp, to Reed on the steel steps. Therefore, adding this match stipulation would firstly provide Bronson to avenge his loss to Strowman(for which Rollins was responsible). Secondly, both men could go unhinged in their attack, use any weapon, go to any place in the arena and bring the roof down, while fighting each other. This would double the entertainment and the danger involved.Which stipulation among these three would you like to be put in the match? Leave your comments below.","Seth Rollins has been granted a match against Bronson Reed at Crown Jewel.
