Understanding the phenomenon





A rare sight









A striking celestial display is poised to light up the night skies for millions across the United States as a potent solar storm makes its approach, beginning Tuesday, 11 November. Scientists predict that the aurora borealis, commonly known as the northern lights, will be visible in at least 21 states, with the spectacle lasting into the early hours of Wednesday, 12 November.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecasts that the lights will be most readily observed between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. Central Time, providing a window of nearly twelve hours for skywatchers. This rare event offers a vivid reminder of the delicate interplay between Earth and its parent star, as charged solar particles collide with the planet’s magnetic field to produce the swirling colours that have fascinated observers for centuries.According to NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center, residents in the following states may catch a glimpse of the aurora:Observers in these regions are encouraged to seek locations with minimal light pollution. Clear, dark skies will maximise the visibility of the aurora, which can appear as faint, undulating curtains of green, red, and purple, depending on atmospheric conditions and the intensity of the solar storm.The northern lights are the visible manifestation of interactions between the solar wind and Earth’s magnetosphere. Plasma from the Sun streams toward Earth, where charged particles are guided along magnetic field lines toward the polar regions. When these particles collide with gases in the atmosphere, they emit light, producing the spectacular displays that have been recorded and celebrated across cultures for millennia.In recent years, NOAA and the National Weather Service have provided increasingly precise forecasts of auroral activity, allowing skywatchers to plan for these fleeting events. The upcoming display is notable not only for its expected breadth, spanning nearly two dozen states, but also for the opportunity it affords the public to witness first-hand the dynamic forces at work in near-Earth space.For many, the northern lights remain a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Even in northern states, the display can be elusive, depending on cloud cover and the intensity of geomagnetic activity. This event underscores both the power of the Sun and the responsiveness of Earth’s magnetic shield, offering a vivid, natural spectacle that marries science with wonder.Skywatchers are advised to dress warmly and allow their eyes to adjust to darkness, enhancing the chances of spotting the aurora. With the lights expected to persist into Wednesday morning, residents from Alaska to Wisconsin have a rare opportunity to witness a natural phenomenon that, for centuries, has inspired awe and scientific curiosity alike.","Northern Lights will be visible across 21 US states from 11–12 November during dark, clear skies.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage for a candid and humours conversation. The tech titans shared their thoughts on the future on generative AI and the long road to building tech empires. In a lighthearted moment, Huang joked that if he had known how long it would take to succeed, the he might have followed Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s oath and dropped out of college early. “If I had known it was going to take so long to succeed… I would've dropped out of college just like you,” Huang quipped, drawing laughter from the audience and Zuckerberg himself.The discussion involving Huang and Zuckerberg spanned around decades of innovation. The discussion started with Zuckerberg praising Huang’s role in powering the AI revolution. “It’s all you—you kind of made this happen,” Zuckerberg said, referring to Nvidia’s dominance in AI infrastructure.Responding to Zuckerberg, Jensen Huang said, “Why thank you… CEOs, we're delicate flowers,” poking fun at the need for appreciation even at the top.Along with this, the two tech leaders also joked about aging and appearances.“We’re pretty grizzled at this point,” Zuckerberg said. “I think we’re the two longest-standing founders in the industry.” Huang agreed, noting his gray hair while Zuckerberg commented on his curls.Huang founded Nvidia in 1993 with just the investment of $200. He launched the company on his 30th birthday which was later joined by co-founders Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. Nvidia started with a mission to advance 3D graphics. The breakthrough came in 1999 with the invention of the GPU, a technology that transformed computing.Fast forward to October 2025, Nvidia has entered the $5 trillion club. The chip maker managed to reach the market valuation of $5 trillion in just three months after crossing $ 4 trillion. This growth in Nvidia's market value suggest the escalating momentum in AI adoption across industries. Shares of Nvidia rose more than 4%, pushing its market capitalisation. Nvidia ranks ahead of Microsoft ($4 trillion) and Apple ($3.9 trillion), as well as Google parent Alphabet ($3.2 trillion), Amazon ($2.4 trillion) and Meta ($1.8 trillion).Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s journey started from his dorm room in Harvard in 2004, from where he started Facebook .

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says ‘Slack creates a lot of fake work’; Elon Musk responds: ‘As I was saying …’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sam-altman-says-slack-creates-a-lot-of-fake-work-elon-musk-responds-as-i-was-saying-/articleshow/125213230.cms,"There are positives about Slack

but I kind of dread the first hour of the morning or last time before I go to bed, where I’m just dealing with this explosion of Slack.

It creates a lot of fake work.”

“As I was saying, OpenAI will compete directly with Microsoft.”

""At this point, it’s insanely suicidal for Microsoft to continue supporting OpenAI"".





Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reacted sharply to Sam Altman ’s remarks about office productivity tools like Slack, saying that the ChatGPT-maker OpenAI will “compete directly with Microsoft”. Sam Altman, founder and CEO of OpenAI recently said that while there are many positives about Slack, it also creates a “lot of fake work”. In a now viral clip, Altman about how current workplace tools — such as Slack, Google Docs, email, and PowerPoint — may soon be replaced by a new generation of AI-driven systems.,” Altman said, “Altman added that he believes a new kind of AI-powered productivity platform is within reach — one where “your AI agent and my AI agent” will handle most communication and tasks, escalating only when necessary.Elon Musk, who has long been critical of OpenAI’s close partnership with Microsoft, responded on X (formerly known as Twitter) with a pointed remark:In another post on X, Elon Musk wrote:The exchange comes as AI companies race to redefine workplace productivity. While Microsoft has heavily invested in “Copilot” features across its apps, Altman’s comments suggest OpenAI could be developing its own tools that may compete in the same space.In a recent post shared on X, Altman suggested that the company is planning another major new business venture, putting it in direct competition with cloud technology giants, including Google, Amazon and Microsoft.Sam Altman wrote in the post: “We are also looking at ways to more directly sell compute capacity to other companies (and people); we are pretty sure the world is going to need a lot of 'AI cloud', and we are excited to offer this.”This means OpenAI could soon start selling cloud services, putting it in competition with established providers such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud. In September, OpenAI Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Sarah Friar made a similar point, suggesting that cloud providers had been “learning on our dime.” Her comment indicated that OpenAI was looking to safeguard its AI expertise from technology companies that may use its developments to advance their own capabilities.Notably, after the GPT-5 launch earlier in the year, Musk warned Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella about competition posed by OpenAI. “OpenAI is going to eat Microsoft alive,” he said.","Elon Musk has reacted sharply to Sam Altman ’s remarks about office productivity tools like Slack, saying that the ChatGPT-maker OpenAI will “compete directly with Microsoft” Elon Musk has long been critical of OpenAI’s close partnership with Microsoft.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125213222,imgsize-28312,width-400,resizemode-4/sam-altman-elon-musk.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

When and how to watch the Northern Lights





What makes this Aurora event unique





Understanding the science behind the Northern Lights





How geomagnetic storms are classified





Tips to improve your chances of seeing the Northern Lights





Find a dark viewing spot far from city lights and face north for the best view. Light pollution can wash out faint auroras, so rural or elevated areas are ideal.

Use your smartphone camera as many modern phone cameras are more sensitive to light than the human eye and can detect faint auroras before they become visible.

Let your eyes adjust to the dark for at least 20 to 30 minutes and avoid looking at bright screens. This allows your vision to adapt to low light and makes it easier to spot subtle colour shifts in the sky.

Dress warmly because temperatures can drop significantly at night, especially in northern regions. Layered clothing, gloves, and hats are essential for comfort during long viewing periods.

Be patient. The Northern Lights are unpredictable and can appear suddenly. Staying outdoors for an extended period improves your chances of witnessing the spectacle.

What to do if you miss tonight’s display

The night sky across the United States is expected to dazzle millions as the Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, become visible in over twenty states from November 11 to 12, 2025. This rare spectacle is fueled by heightened solar activity, including several powerful solar eruptions that send charged particles hurtling toward Earth at incredible speeds. As these particles interact with the planet’s magnetic field, they create stunning displays of shifting light in shades of green, pink, and violet, dancing across the sky in dynamic, ever-changing patterns. The phenomenon, usually confined to polar regions, may reach as far south as states like Kansas and Virginia, offering a rare opportunity for Americans to witness one of nature’s most captivating and colourful celestial events.The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, are expected to dazzle skywatchers across the United States tonight, offering a rare opportunity for millions to witness one of nature’s most mesmerising displays. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), enhanced solar activity has created ideal conditions for auroral visibility, pushing the colourful phenomenon much farther south than usual.If weather conditions remain clear, shimmering curtains of green, pink, and violet light could illuminate the skies across multiple regions, from the Pacific Northwest to the Northeast. This widespread coverage marks one of the most extensive Northern Lights forecasts in recent years, making tonight a particularly exciting occasion for stargazers and photographers alike.Here’s the list of US states:Timing is crucial for observing the aurora borealis. NOAA’s three-day geomagnetic forecast predicts that activity will peak late in the evening and continue into the early hours of 12 November. The best viewing windows are expected to be between 4 pm and 10 pm EST (2100–0300 GMT) for minor to moderate activity, and between 10 pm and 1 am EST (0300–0600 GMT) for stronger geomagnetic storm levels.During these peak hours, observers may witness luminous arcs or shimmering curtains of light dancing across the northern horizon. In some areas, the lights could stretch overhead in glowing ribbons that shift and ripple as magnetic fields interact.The combination of multiple CMEs and an exceptionally powerful solar flare makes this event stand out from recent auroral displays. The convergence of these solar bursts increases the likelihood of intense geomagnetic disturbances. Such interactions can create stacked auroras, where layers of colour overlap, giving the sky an even richer appearance. The last time auroras of this strength reached similar latitudes was during strong solar events several years ago. Additionally, solar activity tends to rise and fall in roughly 11-year cycles known as solar cycles. We are currently nearing the peak of Solar Cycle 25, which explains the recent increase in both sunspots and flares that are the main drivers of auroral events, producing spectacular skies visible to many observers across high-latitude regions.The Northern Lights occur when streams of charged particles from the Sun, known as the solar wind, reach Earth and interact with gases in the upper atmosphere. These collisions release energy in the form of light, producing the stunning patterns that dance across the sky.Oxygen atoms are responsible for the green and red colours most commonly seen, while nitrogen produces blue and purple hues. The exact colours depend on which gases are hit and at what altitude the interactions take place.This week’s event is particularly special because several coronal mass ejections (CMEs), enormous bursts of plasma and magnetic energy from the Sun, are headed toward Earth. These CMEs are part of heightened solar activity linked to an X5.1-class solar flare, the most powerful flare recorded so far in 2025. When these charged particles collide with Earth’s magnetic field, they can cause strong geomagnetic storms, expanding the auroral oval and pushing the Northern Lights much farther south than usual.Geomagnetic storms are measured on a five-level scale from G1 (minor) to G5 (extreme). These classifications are determined by the strength of the disturbance in Earth’s magnetic field.A G3 storm is strong enough to make auroras visible at mid-latitudes, while a G4 storm can extend the visibility range even farther south and may affect some radio communications and satellite operations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued a G4 geomagnetic storm watch, suggesting that much of the continental United States could witness the aurora. It is rare for auroras to reach such southern latitudes, making this a potentially historic event for skywatchers.While space weather determines when the aurora will occur, your viewing experience depends largely on preparation and local conditions. Experts recommend several strategies to increase your odds of seeing the lights clearly.If cloudy skies or poor visibility spoil your view tonight, there is still hope. The sequence of solar eruptions means geomagnetic activity could remain elevated for several days. Keep an eye on forecast updates through NOAA’s channels or dedicated aurora-tracking apps, as new opportunities may arise later this week.Even if you miss this particular show, solar activity is expected to stay strong for the remainder of the year, providing additional chances for aurora sightings across mid-latitudes.","The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, are expected to dazzle skywatchers across the United States tonight.

OpenAI used lyrics in violation of copyright laws: German court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/openai-used-lyrics-in-violation-of-copyright-laws-german-court/articleshow/125263120.cms,".

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





MUNICH: OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT violated German copyright laws by reproducing lyrics from songs by best-selling musician Herbert Groenemeyer and others, a court ruled on Tuesday, in a closely watched case against the firm over its use of lyrics to train its language models. The regional court found that the company trained its AI on protected content from nine German songs, including Groenemeyer’s hits “Maenner” and “Bochum”. The case was brought by German music rights society GEMA.Presiding judge Elke Schwager ordered OpenAI to pay damages for the use of copyrighted material, without disclosing a figure.OpenAI had argued that its language models did not store or copy specific training data but, rather, reflected what they had learned based on the entire training data set.Since the output would only be generated as a result of user inputs known as prompts, it was not the defendants, but the users who would be liable, OpenAI had argued. However, the court found that both the memorisation in the language models and the reproduction of the song lyrics in the chatbot’s outputs constitute infringements of copyright exploitation right.“We disagree with the ruling and are considering next steps,” a spokesperson for OpenAI said. “The decision is for a limited set of lyrics and does not impact the millions of people who use our technology every day.”REUTERS",German court rules OpenAI violated copyright laws by reproducing lyrics from songs by best-selling musician Herbert Groenemeyer and others.

DW Fact check: False

Who is Kussia88?





""I've been mobilized, I'm heading to Chasiv Yar,"" says what appears to be a young Ukrainian soldier through floods of tears in the back of a military vehicle. ""Help me, I don't want to die. I'm only 23. Please help me.""A reverse image search using screenshots reveals that the video has been posted hundreds of times on social media, racking up millions of views and pushing the message that Ukraine is drafting young men against their will to replace losses on the battlefield amid the continuing Russian invasion.DW found the video shared across various social media platforms in a dozen different languages, including English, German, French, Italian, Spanishand Russian. The most viral instance of the video appeared on a Hungarian X account, where it had been viewed at least 1.8 million times.Claim: ""Ukrainian men as young as 23 are being conscripted and sent to the front""However, not only is the video factually incorrect (the minimum conscription age in Ukraine was lowered from 27 to 25 in April 2024, but never to 23), but it is also fake, to be precise: it was generated by artificial intelligence.This is clear from visual inaccuracies in the video, such as the poorly-fitting helmet, which doesn't match standard Ukrainian military equipment.Not only that, a basic facial recognition searchreveals that the face is actually that of Vladimir Yuryevich Ivanov, a young Russian streamer from St. Petersburg who uses the online pseudonym Kussia88.On its own, ""kussia"" (pronounced ""kasha"") means ""porridge"" in Russian (каша). But the use of ""88"" (neo-Nazi code for ""Heil Hitler"") and the Latin transcription using a double ""SS"" are no coincidence.Nor is the use of the letters ""IA"". In international neo-Nazi circles, ""IA"" would be understood to mean ""14"" — a code referring to the ""14 words""propagated by American neo-Nazi David Lane: ""We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.""The slogans have served as a rallying cry for militant white nationalists internationally.Indeed, the numbers 1488 and 8814 appear in the URL and profile description of Ivanov's accounts on TikTok and Boosty(a Russian platform that enables content creators to earn regular income through subscriptions and donations from their community).According to several Reddit chats, Ivanov's Twitch account, which has over 1.3 million followers, has been subject to at least one temporary ban in recent months.The AI video using Ivanov's face seems to have first appeared on the now-deleted TikTok channel @fantomoko, along with dozens of other similar AI clips, all supposedly depicting Ukrainian soldiers crying in military vehicles.Most only seem to have been viewed a few thousand times, but two had over 800,000 views, one had over 1.5 million views and the most popular had over 2.1 million. Some of the videos even featured the watermark ""Sora,"" OpenAI's image generator.Another face that appears regularly on clips posted by the @fantomoko account was that of Aleksei Gubanov, a critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Gubanov, who now lives in New York, told DW that he has ""absolutely no connection"" to the clips. ""All of them were created by someone using AI and without my consent or involvement.""He added he had warned his audience ""that someone is deliberately trying to stir public outrage by creating this kind of content. Those videos play directly into Russian propaganda narratives and gain millions of views. To be absolutely clear — I did not create, approve, or participate in any of those videos, and I strongly condemn the use of AI-generated fake media for manipulation or propaganda.""DW also reached out to Ivanov but had not received a response by the time of publication. According to the Ukrainian database ""Stars about war,"" which documents celebrities' positions on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Ivanov does not typically comment on the war and was once reprimanded by the Russian authorities for mocking the children of mobilized soldiers. After that, he reportedly apologized in a video shot against the background of a Russian flag, and stated that Crimea is Russian.Screenshot of Russian streamer Ivanov (aka Kussia88) posting a comment in Russian that translates as: ""The Twitter crowd have finally got on board the hype train.""Screenshot of Russian streamer Ivanov (aka Kussia88) posting a comment in Russian that translates as: ""The Twitter crowd have finally got on board the hype train.""'The Twitter crowd have finally got on board the hype train,' responds Kussia, sarcastically.Image: TelegramOn his Telegram channel, he responded to suggestions that he was involved with the AI videos and that he is a ""pro-Putin Nazi"" sarcastically, saying: ""The Twitter crowd have finally learned what 'delivery' means"" — Russian Twitch slang effectively meaning: ""They've finally got on board the hype train.""Either way, regardless of whether Ivanov was actively involved in their creation or not, and regardless of his views, the videos going viral remain entirely fake.","A video showing young Ukrainian soldiers crying has gone viral on social media.

Why the UAE deliberately sank 3 ships: Is it bad for the ocIn a unique blend of environmental stewardship and ecotourism, the UAE has deliberately sunk three ships off its east coast, not as an accident, but as a conscious effort to promote marine conservation. The vessels, Inchcape 1, Inchcape 2, and Inchcape 10, have been transformed into thriving artificial reefs that now attract divers from across the world. This innovative approach is a testament to the UAE’s commitment to protecting its natural resources while fostering sustainable tourism.The concept behind sinking these ships is simple yet effective: to create artificial reefs that mimic the role of natural coral reefs in the ocean. Over time, the ships have become vibrant ecosystems, teeming with marine life. These reefs not only support a wide range of fish species but also help to promote biodiversity, offering an underwater experience for divers.The UAE’s efforts are especially significant given the rising threats to ocean ecosystems, including pollution and coral bleaching. The ships, once decommissioned, serve as a reminder that responsible management can help restore marine habitats.Sunk in 2001, Inchcape 1 lies about 32 meters below the surface, off the coast of Al Aqah, Fujairah. Accessible by boat in just five minutes from Al Aqah, this site is recommended for experienced divers, thanks to its depth and complexity. The wreck has turned into a bustling underwater city, home to large schools of red snapper, cardinal fish, and a wide variety of other marine creatures.Divers exploring the site can witness firsthand how the wreck has evolved into a rich marine habitat. Snorkelling and diving equipment are essential to access the site, and the area is becoming a popular spot for eco-tourists looking to experience the UAE’s commitment to sustainable diving.Inchcape 2, intentionally sunk in 2002, rests at a depth of around 22 meters off the coast of Khor Fakkan. It has quickly become one of the most popular dive sites in the region. As the wreck has developed into a thriving coral reef, it now attracts a variety of marine life, including parrotfish, moray eels, small boxfish, and long-tailed rays. The presence of barracudas also adds to the site's allure, making it a must-visit destination for professional divers seeking to explore a healthy and diverse underwater ecosystem.To visit, divers typically embark on a 25-minute boat ride from Al Aqah. Diving equipment is mandatory, and access is managed through licensed diving centers. These centers not only ensure safety but also educate visitors on how artificial reefs contribute to ocean health.Perhaps the most remarkable of the three, Inchcape 10 (formerly known as 'Awaiz') was sunk in 2003. Resting at a depth of about 23 meters off Fujairah, it is one of the largest ships deliberately sunk to create an artificial reef. This site has become a focal point for divers due to its rich biodiversity, including moray eels, barracudas, and other species.Located just an 8-minute boat ride from the Fujairah International Marine Club, the wreck offers an exciting opportunity to explore the wonders of marine life. The site is open year-round, and divers must book through licensed diving centers to gain access. Similar to the other wrecks, the presence of thriving marine life at Inchcape 10 speaks volumes about the success of the UAE’s ecotourism initiatives.Saleh Al-Dhahouri, a diver from Dibba Al Fujairah, has seen firsthand the positive transformation that these shipwrecks have brought to the area. “The diving there is wonderful, a beautiful place, and you couldn't get over the amount of fish and coral,” he said, as told to. He explained that before the ships were sunk, diving opportunities were limited. “With these ships, diving sites have increased, and they have become part of the weekly diving program,” he added, highlighting how these artificial reefs have revitalized local dive tourism.Emirati diver Mintaha Al Shehhi, who specializes in sharks, has been diving in the region for over three years. She praised the ecological balance at sites like Inchcape 2, where frequent sightings of sharks and turtles indicate a healthy environment. “Sharks do not choose random locations, and turtles only pass through when they feel secure and find natural abundance,” she said, emphasizing that the presence of these larger creatures is a sign of a thriving and balanced marine ecosystem.ean’s ecosystem?","The UAE has deliberately sunk three ships off its east coast, not as an accident, but as a conscious effort to promote marine conservation. The vessels have been transformed into thriving artificial reefs that now attract divers from across the world. This innovative approach is a testament to the UAE’s commitment to protecting its natural resources while fostering sustainable tourism.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125237379,imgsize-391145,width-400,resizemode-4/uae-sunked-ship-inchape-1-dive-site.jpg"

Meet the creator - Chef Nouel Catis

The new Abu Dhabi Chocolate

The Main Flavor: A harmonious blend of rich salted caramel and traditional halwa (a dense, sweet delicacy).

Emirati Spices: The filling is layered with complex flavors like cardamom and fragrant saffron, giving it instant warmth and depth.

Local Touches: It features authentic ingredients like creamy tahini and sweet date syrup. The chef even notes hints of Balaleet, the sweet and savory Emirati breakfast dish.

Final Touch: To ensure its capital-city status, the bar is lavishly topped with shimmering 24-karat gold flakes.

Where to get the Golden Bar

Exclusive Initial Location: The Abu Dhabi Chocolate bar is initially sold exclusively at Rain Cafe outlets across the UAE.

Wider Delivery: For the brand's other popular flavors (like the Dubai Chocolate), you can often find them available for order on local food delivery platforms like Careem and Talabat in both Dubai and Abu Dhabi.

Price check

Price Range: The Abu Dhabi Chocolate bar is priced at approximately Dh100 (roughly $27 USD) for a 200g bar.

Other Sna'ap Bars: For comparison, the original 90g Dubai Chocolate bars typically sell for around Dh38.

Getting the viral treat outside the UAE

Rely on Travelers: The most common way to get the bars abroad is through friends, family, or colleagues who are traveling from the UAE and can carry them back as a unique souvenir.

Third-Party Shipping Services: Some international fans resort to using re-shipping or concierge services based in the UAE. These services purchase the bar locally and then ship it internationally, though this adds significant cost and is not handled by the chocolate maker itself.

Check Pop-ups: Keep an eye on the official Sna'ap/Chef Nouel Catis social media channels. As the brand grows, they may announce international pop-up events or partnerships that temporarily make the bars available in other countries.

Dubai’s famous Pistachio Crunch

Pistachio-Tahini Cream: A smooth, creamy paste with a deep, nutty Middle Eastern flavor.

Crispy Kataifi: Finely shredded, toasted filo dough, which gives the bar an irresistible, signature crunch (inspired by the famous dessert Knafeh).





If you’ve seen videos of people biting into a thick, crunchy chocolate bar and gasping with delight, you’ve met “Dubai chocolate.” Behind that viral crunch is Filipino pastry chef Nouel Catis, and now he’s turning the idea into new, capital-flavoured treats (think salted caramel + halwa). This is the story foodies want: invention, nostalgia, social-media fame, and a chef turning a trend into a brand you can actually taste.Chef Nouel Catis is a Filipino-born pastry specialist who quietly became the brains behind the original Dubai chocolate, an inventive bar that layers Middle Eastern flavours (pistachio, tahini/kunafa elements) inside a crisp, hollow chocolate shell. His approach mixes childhood memories, heritage ingredients and modern pastry technique to produce a product that looks simple but performs like a theatrical dessert on your palate. His name has since become linked with Sna’ap, his own chocolate brand and pop-up experiences.After conquering the global desert scene with Dubai’s crunchy bar, Chef Nouel Catis is paying homage to the UAE capital with the new Abu Dhabi Chocolate. This bar ditches the pistachio crunch for a flavor profile that is richer, spicier, and truly rooted in Emirati heritage.The Abu Dhabi bar is an ode to local sweets and spices, captured in a thick, luxurious form:Priced around Dh100 for a 200g bar, this is positioned as a truly luxurious, indulgent piece of edible art—initially sold exclusively at local hotspots like Rain Cafe.Because the Abu Dhabi Chocolate is a brand-new, special-edition launch, its availability is currently quite exclusive. The bar is a collaborative effort with a popular local cafe brand.The unique artisanal quality, the luxurious ingredients (like 24K gold), and its status as a viral, limited-edition treat put this bar in the premium category.For fans who want a genuine taste of luxury blended with authentic Emirati flavors, many consider the unique experience a worthwhile indulgence.If you’re a traveling foodie or a UAE resident currently abroad, getting these viral bars requires a bit of planning, as direct international shipping from the cafe is usually not available.If you're active on social media, you've definitely seen the satisfying snap of the viral Dubai Chocolate. Created by Chef Nouel Catis of the Sna'ap brand, this chocolate bar became a global hit because it’s much more than just a sweet treat, it’s a textural masterpiece.The secret to the original bar's obsession-worthy status lies in its core ingredients:This perfect contrast between the rich, creamy filling and the crispy pastry is why foodies worldwide have been trying to recreate this famous UAE-born chocolate.So, whether you're clicking ""add to cart"" via a delivery app in Dubai or hoping a traveling friend brings you a gold-flaked souvenir, one thing is clear: Chef Nouel Catis has successfully merged Middle Eastern heritage with modern indulgence.

Historical context





Winter in the UAE





Implications and observations





Daily life: Cooler mornings may require warmer clothing, while daytime conditions remain comfortable.

Travel and tourism: Early-morning temperatures in places like Al Ain and Ras Al Khaimah could affect outdoor activities, especially in desert or mountainous regions.

Agriculture: Frost-sensitive crops in elevated areas might need extra protection during these cold snaps.





The UAE woke up to a chilly start Sunday as temperatures in Raknah, Al Ain, plunged to 9.8°C, the lowest of the season so far, signaling the arrival of winter across the Emirates, the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) reportedAt 6:30am UAE local time, the mercury dropped to 9.8°C in Raknah, Al Ain, marking the coldest reading in the country today. The NCM confirmed this figure, emphasizing that winter in the UAE brings milder conditions compared to the scorching summer months.Typical winter daytime temperatures range between 15°C and 25°C, offering a welcome relief for residents and visitors alike. However, early mornings and elevated areas often experience significantly cooler temperatures.While today’s low is notable, it is far from the UAE’s all-time record. On February 3, 2017, temperatures in the country plunged to -5.7°C at Jebel Jais, the nation’s highest peak located around 25 kilometres from Ras Al Khaimah City. This remains the coldest temperature ever officially recorded in the UAE.For the current year, 2025, the lowest recorded temperature prior to today was 1.9°C on January 4 at Jebel Jais, following a 2.2°C reading the day before. These figures illustrate the pattern of early-morning chills in mountainous areas, even as daytime temperatures remain moderate.The UAE’s winter season, which typically runs from November to March, is characterized by cooler mornings, mild days, and relatively low humidity levels. While daytime temperatures in most urban and coastal areas stay between 15°C and 25°C, residents in desert regions or high-altitude locations may experience sharp dips in temperature overnight, particularly during the colder months.The NCM continues to monitor these fluctuations closely, issuing guidance for residents to prepare for colder mornings and potential weather-related impacts, particularly in elevated or exposed areas.Today’s 9.8°C reading in Raknah is a reminder that while UAE winters are mild compared to many countries, early-morning chills can still be significant, especially in inland and mountainous locations","The UAE woke up to a chilly start Sunday as temperatures in Raknah, Al Ain, plunged to 9.8°C, the lowest of the season so far.

Saudi launches Self-Deportation platform and AI smart track for faster airport immigration processing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/saudi-launches-self-deportation-platform-and-ai-smart-track-for-faster-airport-immigration-processing/articleshow/125178064.cms,"Saudi digitises deportation and travel checks with AI systems / AI-generated image

Deportation goes digital

The platform lets the user submit required exit paperwork and verification online.

Launch timing: the platform will be rolled out “shortly” after technical and security checks are completed (no firm public date was given).

Smart track and AI identity verification

The future of Airport queues

The Smart Track System: This innovative track will allow travelers to pass through immigration controls where their identities are verified solely via advanced smart cameras. Crucially, these cameras are capable of verifying the identities of up to 35 people simultaneously. This unprecedented speed means passengers can complete their entry or exit procedures without needing to interact with a passport control officer, drastically cutting down processing time.

Digital Twins Technology: Tested successfully during the Hajj season of 1445 AH (2024), this system relies on complex models and data analysis. This provides real-time insights into crucial operational metrics, including:



Analyzing crowd movement patterns within terminals. Accurately calculating passenger waiting times at passport control areas. Continuously monitoring passenger satisfaction with the services provided.



The Absher ecosystem

Digital Passport and International Cooperation: The digital passport is already available on the Absher platform, simplifying international travel procedures for beneficiaries. Jawazat is actively working to conclude international agreements with other countries to ensure the acceptance and expansion of this digital passport for global travel.

Jawazat is actively working to conclude international agreements with other countries to ensure the acceptance and expansion of this digital passport for global travel. A Unified Gateway for Data: To improve security and facilitate international transit, the Jawazat has serious plans to establish a ""unified gateway between countries"" for the exchange of passenger data. This system will be secured through formal agreements, ensuring that passenger data is streamlined as soon as they transit through the Kingdom to other international destinations.

Service Accessibility: The Absher platform currently offers more than 100 digital services, which benefited over 24 million users in the year 2024 alone. Jawazat has also introduced the ""Smart Voice Agent"" service, available 24/7 by calling the number 992, providing immediate assistance to users without the need for direct employee intervention.





Acting Director General of Passports (Jawazat), Maj. Gen. Saleh Al-Murabba, announced at the Digital Government Forum 2025 in Riyadh that the directorate will shortly roll out a Self-Deportation Platform to let people who are in the Kingdom illegally complete departure procedures online. He also unveiled a Smart Track system that uses smart cameras and AI to verify identities and process groups of travellers, potentially eliminating the need for routine passport-control staff at some checkpoints.The Self-Deportation Platform is an online portal designed to replace manual, paper-heavy deportation practices. According to the announcement, once security and technical preparations are completed, individuals identified as violators of residency, labour or border rules will be able to access the platform, complete travel documentation and finalise their exit without in-person processing. The move is framed as both an efficiency and a modernisation step, shifting a time-consuming administrative task into a secure digital flow.Key practical points reported so far:Smart Track is the complementary system for major travel hubs. It uses advanced smart cameras and AI technology to check identities and can reportedly verify up to 35 people at once, allowing essential travel procedures to complete smoothly without an individual passport-control officer present.The system aims to efficiently accelerate passenger flow at airports and other checkpoints by intelligently automating identity verification and cross-checking against vital security databases. Officials say the innovative technology will be introduced once integration with Jawazat security systems is fully completedFor travelers passing through the Kingdom’s ports, two major technological leaps are set to eliminate slow-moving lines and long waiting times:Furthermore, departure procedures are being streamlined to a great extent. By linking technical and security systems to smart devices and digital cameras for automated verification, the traditional requirement of passing through passport control at departure lounges will be eliminated, creating a seamless boarding experience.The push for digitalization extends beyond the airport floor and into the wider administrative ecosystem, with the Absher platform at the center of innovation:Saudi Arabia's commitment to these digital reforms, anchored by the launch of the Self-Deportation Platform and the AI-driven Smart Track system, clearly signals a new and transformative era. By transforming its ports into smart, efficient gateways and streamlining administrative services through cutting-edge technology, the Kingdom is solidifying its position as a leader in digital government, ensuring faster travel, seamless security, and a radically improved experience for all who enter or exit its borders.","Self-Deportation Platform to let people who are in the Kingdom illegally complete departure procedures online.

Banality of evil: German nurse kills 10 patients,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/banality-of-evil-german-nurse-kills-10-patients-to-reduce-workload/articleshow/125132828.cms,"



It sounds like a line from a Kafka play rewritten by Kafka’s nurse. A man whose job was to ease suffering decided the easiest way to do that was to remove the sufferer entirely.According to a BBC report, a palliative care nurse in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering 10 patients and attempting to kill 27 others. His motive? Not money. Not mercy. Just the mundane — to lighten his workload during overnight shifts.Between December 2023 and May 2024, this nameless nurse — anonymous by law, infamous by act — played God with a syringe. Prosecutors said he injected elderly patients with morphine and midazolam, not to relieve their pain but to make his rounds quieter, his night easier, his burden lighter. He showed, the court heard, “irritation” at those who demanded too much care — as if suffering were an inconvenience on the shift roster.The court in Aachen called it a crime of “particular severity of guilt,” ensuring he will never walk free again. But what’s truly chilling is not just the scale of his actions — it’s their ordinariness. A man trained since 2007 to heal became, by 2024, an executioner in scrubs, armed not with malice but with indifference.Investigators are now exhuming more bodies, probing whether this was just the visible tip of a career-long pattern.If confirmed, he could rival the grim legacy of Niels Högel — the German nurse sentenced in 2019 for killing 85 patients in northern hospitals between 1999 and 2005. Högel wanted to play hero: inject, cause cardiac arrest, then resuscitate — a perverse performance of saviourhood.This new killer? He wanted peace and quiet.That’s the most terrifying part. Evil, it turns out, doesn’t always come snarling. Sometimes it sighs, glances at the clock, and reaches for the morphine. It isn’t ideological or even sadistic — just tired, overworked, and catastrophically devoid of empathy.In that sense, this case isn’t only about a man who murdered ten people. It’s about the slow erosion of compassion in systems that reduce care to shift patterns and metrics. When life becomes data, death becomes a shortcut.Germany has seen this before. It will see it again. Because as Hannah Arendt might have said of this nurse, it wasn’t the devil in him that killed those patients — it was the paperwork.","A palliative care nurse in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering 10 patients and attempting to kill 27 others.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.





When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification







Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Related FAQs



Do I need both the new Aadhaar app and mAadhaar?

Yes, the new Aadhaar app is optimised for daily presentation, selective sharing and family profile management; mAadhaar remains useful for document downloads, PVC orders and some account management tasks.

Can I add someone else’s Aadhaar to my phone?

You can add family members’ Aadhaar profiles only if those Aadhaar records share the same registered mobile number; each profile still requires OTP and face authentication.

Is the e-Aadhaar PDF available in the new app?

As of the app launch coverage, e-Aadhaar PDF downloads remain a function of mAadhaar and UIDAI’s web portals; the new app focuses on on-phone presentation and selective sharing. Confirm the latest changes on UIDAI’s official website if this has been updated.

Will the app expose my Aadhaar number to merchants or services?

The app supports masked sharing and selective disclosure, so you can choose to share only required fields (for example, name and photo) rather than the full Aadhaar number. Use QR-based verification to limit direct numeric exposure.





The Unique Identification Authority of India ( UIDAI ) has launched a new Aadhaar mobile application designed to simplify and secure the process of carrying and sharing digital identity for residents. The app is presented as a lightweight, profile-centric digital wallet for Aadhaar: it lets users store and present their Aadhaar details on a smartphone, control what they share, and add multiple family profiles on one device where the profiles use the same registered mobile number. At launch, UIDAI positions the new Aadhaar app as complementary to the existing mAadhaar app (which continues to support document downloads, PVC card orders and certain account management functions).The new app emphasises modern authentication methods, including face authentication, biometric locks, QR-code sharing and offline access for everyday verification, while continuing to rely on established UIDAI safeguards such as OTP verification tied to the Aadhaar-registered mobile number. These features are intended to increase convenience while giving residents more control over how and when their identity is revealed.The new UIDAI Aadhaar app brings the following capability set to smartphones:Download: Install the official “Aadhaar” app from Google Play Store (Android) or Apple App Store (iOS).

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

Read Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's message

Amazon is building 'Project Rainier'





Microsoft has announced that it has connected massive datacenters in Wisconsin and Atlanta through a high-speed fiber-optic network, creating what it calls the world’s first “planet-scale AI superfactory. ” The new system links the two sites — roughly 700 miles and five states apart — to function as a single, unified computing complex designed specifically for artificial intelligence. Unlike traditional cloud datacenters that host millions of separate applications, Microsoft said the new facilities are built to handle single, large-scale AI workloads that span multiple locations.Each datacenter contains hundreds of thousands of Nvidia GPUs connected through a high-speed network architecture known as an AI Wide Area Network (AI-WAN), allowing them to share processing tasks in real time. The company is also introducing a two-story datacenter design that packs GPUs more densely while reducing latency, supported by a closed-loop liquid cooling system to manage heat and energy use.By linking sites across regions, Microsoft says it can dynamically balance workloads, pool computing capacity, and distribute massive power demands across the electric grid, reducing dependence on energy availability in any one location.The combined system will be used to train and run the next generation of AI models for key partners including OpenAI, France’s Mistral AI, and Elon Musk’s xAI, as well as Microsoft’s own in-house models.The initiative underscores the rapid escalation of AI infrastructure investment among global tech giants. Microsoft spent over $34 billion on capital expenditures last quarter — much of it dedicated to datacenters and GPUs — as part of what it calls a long-term strategy to meet surging AI demand.Today we announced our new Fairwater datacenter in Atlanta, connected with our first Fairwater site in Wisconsin and our broader Azure footprint to create the world’s first AI superfactory.Fairwater exemplifies our vision for a fungible fleet: infra that can serve any workload, anywhere, on fit-for-purpose accelerators and network paths, with maximum performance and efficiency.AI workloads have evolved beyond large-scale pre-training. Today, they encompass fine-tuning, reinforcement learning (RL), synthetic data generation, evaluation pipelines, and more. Fairwater is built to support this full lifecycle:Max density: Fairwater’s two-story design and liquid cooling system lets us place racks in three dimensions and pack them with GPUs as densely as possible, minimizing cable runs and improving latency and effective bandwidth.Fleet: Each Fairwater DC can integrate hundreds of thousands of the latest NVIDIA GPUs into a single coherent cluster. This provides flexible infra that can support the full spectrum of workloads, and ensure no GPU is left unnecessarily idle.And that’s on top of the more than 100,000 GB300s coming online this quarter alone for inference across the rest of our fleet. For us, it’s all about turning every gigawatt into the maximum number of useful tokens. Not every GW is created equal!Planet-scale: Every Fairwater DC will connect through our continent-spanning AI WAN to prior generations of AI supercomputers, forming a truly fungible pool of compute. This enables developers to scale beyond the capacity of a single site and dynamically land workloads on the right infra for their needs.Together, these innovations let us bring together different generations of silicon and AI systems across DCs and geos into a single elastic system that scales seamlessly across training and inference workloadsAnd this elastic AI capacity is all available alongside all the other cloud services (compute, storage, databases, app services) that AI agents and workloads need.This is what we mean when we talk about building a fungible fleet – a single, unified platform that pushes the limits of performance per watt and per dollar.Rivals are racing to keep pace. Amazon is building “Project Rainier,” a 1,200-acre complex of seven datacenters in Indiana, while Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic are making similar multibillion-dollar commitments to AI-focused infrastructure.Some analysts have cautioned that the scale of these investments could resemble a tech bubble if business customers fail to derive meaningful value from AI in the short term.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu on Arattai app dropping out of top 100 list: ‘I literally told our employees…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zoho-founder-sridhar-vembu-on-arattai-app-dropping-out-of-top-100-list-i-literally-told-our-employees/articleshow/125278324.cms,"Vembu: Zoho has long-term strategy







Zoho Corporation founder and CEO Sridhar Vembu has responded to his company's messaging app Arattai falling out of the top 100 apps list, calling it a normal part of business development and dismissing critics as wasting their time. In an interview with ANI, Vembu addressed questions about WhatsApp testing a feature that would allow users to message people on other platforms.“There's nothing going wrong. I think, first of all, the idea that something went wrong is what is wrong. It is a normal course of events. Nothing goes straight to the moon. You have to go through these ups and downs,” Vembu was quoted as saying.He emphasised that companies that survive maintain a long-term perspective.“The trick to companies that survive is they have a long-term view on this. In fact, I never thought The number one is anything big. In fact, I literally told our employees, this is a particular moment, it won't last,” he added.“That's why I simply don't pay attention. And the people who pay attention and making fun of this, they are wasting their time. That's all I'll say. We are not wasting time. I am sitting and we are sitting and focused on code.So I said, don't worry about it,” Vembu noted, pointing out that Zoho views Arattai as a five to 15-year project rather than a short-term venture.Vembu revealed that Zoho has worked on messaging technology for 10 years, making the recent ranking drop insignificant.“Our strategy in all this, the messaging is very core. And we have been working on it for 10 years. So this one month is nothing for us. We will continue this and we have a really strong app. It's getting stronger,” the cofounder was quoted as saying.The company plans frequent updates to improve Arattai. Vembu argued that credible competition is necessary to prevent monopolistic practices in the messaging app market.“If we don't have competition, you can't keep the monopolist honest. The only thing that keeps a monopolist honest is competition,” he said.",Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu has responded to his company's messaging app Arattai falling out of the top 100 apps list.
