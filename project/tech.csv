‘Chasing shadow in room of mirrors’: Why Delhi Police can’t crack the school bomb threat puzzle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/chasing-shadow-in-room-of-mirrors-why-bomb-hoax-probes-hit-dead-end/articleshow/128571891.cms,"Blame It On Ironclad Privacy Of Swiss Servers, Geopolitical Opacity Of Foreign Domains, VPN Shields

AI Impact Summit, Supreme Court on CAA, India-France Ties & More





NEW DELHI: After some south Delhi schools received bomb hoaxes earlier this month, a technical probe led police to a virtual private network (VPN) service in Bangladesh. Days later, a spate of similar threats in northwest Delhi led them to a US-based VPN, while hoaxes reported in west Delhi schools a few months ago involved a Singapore-based VPN. However, even as police were busy writing to these networks to gather user details, they were flooded with more hoaxes.So, why is the law enforcement seemingly helpless in curbing this menace?When a threatening email lands in the inbox of a school in the city, the tactical response in the form of blaring sirens, evacuation of students and deployment of sniffer dogs and cops on the campuses is loud and swift.However, in tech dens of the police cyber cell, the reaction is quieter and the fightback uphill and borderline demoralising. For Delhi's cyber-investigators, each hoax call represents a forensic dead end.Despite a string of such high-profile scares stretching into early 2026, the perpetrators remain digital ghosts. The inability to crack these cases isn't due to a lack of manpower, but owing to unsurmountable technical hurdles: the ironclad privacy of Swiss servers, geopolitical opacity of foreign domains and multi-layered shields of VPNs.When investigators attempt to ‘ping' the origin of a threat, they aren't led to a desktop in Delhi, but to a server in a jurisdiction like Panama or the Seychelles. Using VPN chains — routing a connection through multiple encrypted tunnels — the perpetrator ensures that the IP address visible to Delhi Police is a dummy.""The hoaxers hide their actual location in Delhi or elsewhere behind a series of encrypted ‘tunnels'. The IP address that police see may belong to a server in Austria, Singapore or Netherlands. To us, it is like chasing a shadow in a room full of mirrors; every time we think we have a lead, the trail bounces to another country,"" said a cyber cell investigator.To get a real IP, police must request logs from a VPN provider. However, most premium services used by these actors operate on a strict no-log policy, meaning they do not store records of who use their services at a specific time. Simply put, there's no data to be handed over to the cops. So, the trail doesn't just go cold, it ceases to exist in the physical world.This wall of anonymity is reinforced by the choice of platform. In several high-profile waves of bomb threats, including the massive surge in hoaxes in May 2024 and the recent cases this month, the senders utilised Switzerland-based ProtonMail. Known for its militant commitment to privacy, ProtonMail uses end-to-end encryption, which even it can't bypass, and does not require a phone number or personal details to create an account. From an investigative standpoint, this is a nightmare.Because the service is protected by Swiss privacy laws, Delhi Police can't issue a standard search warrant. It must navigate the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty — a diplomatic marathon that requires proving ‘double criminality' (that the act is a crime in both India and Switzerland). Even then, the most police may receive is basic metadata — like the time of the creation of an account — which is rarely enough to identify a sophisticated user who had signed up using a masked identity.The ‘Russian angle' adds a final layer of complexity. Many hoax emails carry an ‘.ru' suffix, often from services like mail.ru. Investigators frequently find that these domains are used as a tactical smokescreen.By the time a request for information moves through the bureaucratic channels of Interpol, the specific account is usually deleted and the logs are overwritten.Occasionally, police do catch a break — usually when a ‘copycat' or a student makes a fundamental error in operational security, such as forgetting to turn on the VPN or using a personal recovery email. In late 2024, a student in Delhi was apprehended after sending a threat to his own school to avoid taking an an exam. He had forgotten to turn on his VPN, leaving his home IP address exposed.However, for the professional operators who target dozens of schools simultaneously, the global digital architecture is their greatest ally. The sheer volume of schools targeted — sometimes over 100 in a single morning — suggests a level of planning that involves scraping school databases from the dark web or using automated crawlers.So, as long as this infrastructure allows for perfect anonymity, all Delhi Police can do is operate within a reactive loop: evacuate students, search bags and declare hoaxes, while those behind the screen remain digital phantoms.","Delhi's cyber-investigators, each hoax call represents a forensic dead end. Despite a string of such high-profile scares stretching into early 2026, the perpetrators remain digital ghosts.

A coastal home built around family and routine

Tennis icon Rafael Nadal has spent most of his life on the road, moving from one tournament city to another. But unlike many global sports stars, Nadal never drifted too far from where it all began for him. Home for him has always meant Mallorca. In Porto Cristo, the quiet seaside town where he grew up, Nadal built a modern mansion overlooking the Mediterranean – a place that keeps him close to family, routine and the island that shaped him. The property sits along the eastern coast of Mallorca, in an area known for privacy and sea views. Rather than relocating to Madrid, Barcelona or another global hub, Nadal chose to stay rooted in his hometown. For someone who has won Grand Slams across the world, that decision says a lot. The house offers security and space, but more importantly, familiarity. From his terrace, he looks out at the same coastline he knew as a child.Nadal’s Porto Cristo mansion replaced an older family property and was rebuilt into a sleek, multi-level home designed with clean lines and large windows facing the sea. The structure is modern but understated.It blends into the rocky coastline rather than standing out from it. Reports describe expansive terraces, open-plan living areas and direct views of the Mediterranean. Inside, the design is simple and functional. Wide glass panels bring in natural light. Neutral tones dominate the interiors. The focus appears to be comfort rather than extravagance. The property reportedly includes multiple bedrooms for family and guests, along with private leisure spaces.Unlike some athletes who build training courts at home, Nadal’s professional base is just minutes away at the Rafa Nadal Academy. The academy serves as his main training centre, meaning his residence remains primarily a personal retreat rather than a performance compound. That separation allows him to draw a line between work and home life.The mansion is priced at around $4 million approximately, reflecting its prime coastal location and custom redevelopment. Nadal is believed to have invested heavily in rebuilding the property over the years to ensure privacy and modern standards.For fans, Nadal’s home reflects the same qualities seen in his career – loyalty, discipline and deep connection to his roots. While he conquered courts around the world, he never left Mallorca behind. His Porto Cristo mansion is not about spectacle. It is about staying grounded, even after global success.","Rafael Nadal has spent most of his life on the road, moving from one tournament city to another.

Find out.Image via: Getty

Where Paige Spiranac's income really comes from



Paige Spiranac did not make her money by winning major golf tournaments. In fact, her professional playing career was relatively short. But what she did build, quietly and steadily, was one of the biggest personal brands in modern golf. Today, she is better known as a golf personality, influencer and media figure than as a former tour player. And that shift has paid off. As of 2026, Paige Spiranac’s net worth is widely estimated to be between $2 million and $3 million, as per Golf365 and most reports placing her in that range. The key point is this: her earnings have come from visibility, not prize money. Spiranac has more than 4 million followers on Instagram alone. Across platforms including TikTok, YouTube and X, her total audience is close to 11 million. That kind of reach matters. Brands pay for access to engaged audiences, and Spiranac has one of the most engaged followings in golf.Most of her revenue comes from sponsorships and brand partnerships. Industry estimates suggest she can earn somewhere between $8,000 and $12,000 for a single sponsored Instagram post, as per Golf Monthly, depending on the deal.Multiply that across campaigns and annual partnerships, and the numbers grow quickly. She has worked with golf and lifestyle brands such as Callaway, 18Birdies, Swag Golf, Lululemon and Women’s Health. These are not one-off collaborations. They are part of a steady commercial strategy built around her online presence.Beyond sponsored posts, Spiranac earns from subscription-based content, offering exclusive golf instruction and behind-the-scenes material to paying subscribers. That recurring income model gives her more stability than simple ad partnerships. She doesn’t just post ads. She includes products naturally in her golf content, so they feel part of what she’s already doing. She also earns money from event appearances, speaking engagements and hosting digital shows, which add to her total income. She has also expanded into media. Her appearance in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition broadened her audience beyond golf. More recently, she launched Paige Co., a new media venture in partnership with Pro Shop, the company connected to the creators behind Netflix’s Full Swing. The project focuses on original content and branded products, and she reportedly holds equity in the business.Paige Spiranac’s financial story is not about trophies. It is about timing, platform awareness and turning attention into ownership.

Jimmy Donaldson has built a career on spectacle, generosity, and relentless ambition. Still, life at the top of YouTube comes with a strange trade-off. Every expression, gesture, and frame gets dissected by millions of viewers. That reality surfaced again this week when a social media user claimed the creator’s eyes looked unusual and that they “never smile,” sparking a viral thread.Rather than ignore the remark, Donaldson chose to respond. His reply shifted attention away from appearance and toward a personal health issue he has quietly managed for years. The moment revealed how quickly online criticism can spread and how direct honesty can reset the tone of a conversation.Replying on X, Donaldson wrote, ""I love how the biggest criticism of me is about my eyes which are out of my control. I’m borderline blind in my right eye, the reason they look off is because I have to squint my right eye to see better even with my contacts in."" He followed it with a blunt admission: ""There is nothing I can do.""The original poster apologized after learning the reason. Supporters then flooded the thread with messages defending the creator and criticizing the tendency to fixate on appearance.One user wrote, ""People will literally find a way to villainize a man for the way his eyes focus while he’s busy curing blindness for thousands,"" referencing Donaldson’s well-known philanthropy projects that have funded vision surgeries.Another commenter urged empathy, writing, ""people will always attack what they can see instead of what actually matters... the fact you’re still showing up and explaining it takes more strength than they’ll ever admit, why do we act like someone’s face is public property,"" a sentiment that resonated widely.Not every response was sympathetic. Some critics questioned his authenticity on camera, while others mocked his wealth in relation to his condition. ""Don't you have enough money by now to buy new eyes?"", one said.Reports say that Donaldson's reach is growing, with close to a billion unique viewers watching his content every month. His honest answer did more than just explain a visual detail. It reminded people that there is a real person behind the thumbnails and viral challenges who is dealing with both global fame and everyday problems.","YouTube star Jimmy Donaldson responds to criticism about his eyes.

Kayla Nicole Talks about ""Right Person, Wrong Timing"" as Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift Plan Summer 2026 Wedding



""You were in it for real / She was in her phone / and you were just a pose.""

America's Next Top Model

""She’s out here romanticizing a situationship that ended in 2022… we’ve had two Olympics since then""

It’s been nearly four years since Kayla Nicole and Travis Kelce called it quits, but it seems like the drama is fresher than ever in 2026. A recent interview clip has gone viral where Kayla gets vulnerable about her relationship history, specifically using the phrase ""right person, wrong time. "" While she was trying to be deep about the ""headspace"" needed for marriage, fans aren't buying it.The reaction from the internet has been swift (no pun intended) and blunt: ""Just accept he didn’t pick you.""The reason this specific interview is causing such an uproar is because of what’s happening in Travis’s actual life. He’s currently planning a summer 2026 wedding with Taylor Swift. To fans, hearing Kayla talk about ""wrong timing"" makes it sound like she believes they’d still be together if the stars had aligned differently. The harsh reality, according to commenters, is that he simply found the ""right person"" in someone else.Adding fuel to the fire is Kayla’s recent Super Bowl commercial for the Sleeper app. In the ad, she plays a woman getting ""ex-communicated"" from a famous ex, with a punchline that literally uses the word ""Swiftly."" While Kayla has claimed she wants to ""reclaim her narrative,"" fans feel she’s doing the opposite. By constantly accepting jobs and doing interviews that center around being ""the ex,"" she’s keeping herself in a shadow that Travis moved out of years ago.Just last week, Kayla posted content joking about being single on Valentine's Day. While usually harmless, because Travis and Taylor are currently in the news for planning their summer 2026 wedding. In late 2025, Taylor Swift released a song called ""Opalite"" (from her latest album). Fans are convinced the lyrics shade Kayla:Kayla responded on Instagram with a cryptic clip of Eva Marcille fromsaying, ""I don't compare myself to other girls... I'm no comparison to anyone else.""The consensus on social media is that there’s a fine line between sharing your truth and being stuck in the past. With Travis and Taylor’s wedding just months away, the ""right person, wrong time"" excuse feels more like a refusal to move on than a relatable life lesson. As one viral comment put it:Whether the comment was for Travis or someone else only she knows but fans aren't letting it slide easily.","A recent interview clip of Kayla Nicole has gone viral.

BENGALURU: With unchecked use of gadgets leading to a significant decline in reading and learning abilities, Karnataka govt has announced a statewide campaign — Mobile Bidi Pustaka Hidi (drop mobile, take up books) — to encourage reading habit among 50-lakh students in govt schools and curb excessive mobile phone usage.In a recent circular, the department of state education, research and training — which will oversee programme implementation — has said the key objective is to systematically cultivate a love of reading among students and shape them into responsible citizens with “active, thoughtful, and high-thinking abilities”.The department has urged schools to create awareness about the safe and moderate use of phones & social media through co-curricular activities .Students should be encouraged to simultaneously take up indoor and outdoor sports, painting, singing, story and poetry writing, and embroidery.Teachers should take steps to encourage use of library and good books. Children should be introduced to use of maps, dictionaries, encyclopaedias, and other reference books available in school. Activities such as introducing the book read, storytelling competitions and review writing should be organised.In collaboration with the health department, schools must educate students on likely mental health problems and effects on academic performance. The women and child welfare department must create awareness among mothers and the community through anganwadi workers.The department can invite gram panchayat members, who can encourage children to visit the library more often. Police officials from cybercrime can raise awareness about issues like cyberbullying.","Karnataka govt has announced a statewide campaign.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Improve treatment effectiveness

Reduce required doses

Increase overall safety

Lower long-term treatment costs

Genetic interventions for brain disorders

Cell-based therapy models to study disease progression

Biomarker identification to track disease and treatment response

Tools to better understand how brain diseases evolve over time

The UAE's healthcare vision



Why this matters?





The UAE has officially entered a new era of ""precision medicine."" Moving away from simply managing symptoms, Emirates Health Services (EHS) recently unveiled two ambitious gene therapy projects designed to strike at the root causes of autism and rare brain disorders.By leveraging genetic engineering, the UAE isn't just treating patients, it’s aiming to ""repair"" the biological blueprints that cause these conditions in the first place.The United Arab Emirates has unveiled two groundbreaking gene therapy projects focused on treating serious neurological and genetic conditions in children. These efforts mark a major shift from conventional symptom-based care to tackling the underlying genetic causes of disease, potentially transforming neurodevelopmental healthcare in the region.One key project focuses on genetic causes linked to autism and epilepsy. It is being developed in collaboration with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), a world-renowned paediatric research centre.Scientists will work on enhanced gene delivery systems that target specific brain cells, which could:The project specifically includes rare conditions such as Beta-Propeller Protein-Associated Neurodegeneration (BPAN), a disorder that often begins in childhood with autism-like symptoms and seizures before progressing to serious motor and cognitive decline.This strategy represents a major scientific shift because it aims to treat the root genetic causes rather than just managing symptoms.The second gene therapy initiative centres on neurodegenerative diseases. Researchers will explore methods to repair faulty genes and use advanced techniques such as:Artificial intelligence and data analytics will help researchers make sense of genetic information collected through national programmes like the Emirati Genome Programme, enabling earlier diagnosis and intervention for children at higher risk.This approach relies on cutting-edge technology and global expertise to refine treatment precision and open doors for future inherited disease therapies.Leading experts at EHS described the projects as part of a “strategic shift” in healthcare, moving from traditional care models to evidence-based, innovation-driven treatments that directly address the causes of genetic disease.Dr Issam Al Zarooni, Executive Director of Medical Services at EHS, highlighted that this direction aims to improve quality of life and local capabilities in advanced medicine and biotechnology.Meanwhile, Dr. Noor Al Mheiri, Director of Mental Health and Visiting Physicians at EHS, stressed that integrating scientific research with responsible clinical application is key to reducing the psychological, social, and economic burdens families face.Autism and rare neurogenetic disorders affect thousands of families globally and in the UAE. Researchers have long been exploring genetic and early diagnostic methods, including genome sequencing and machine-learning diagnostic tools, to better understand and detect these conditions.The new UAE projects build on this broader scientific momentum, offering hope for earlier, more effective, and personalised treatments that could one day change how conditions like monogenic autism and other brain diseases are treated.",The United Arab Emirates has unveiled two groundbreaking gene therapy projects focused on treating serious neurological and genetic conditions in children.

On Saturday, February 21, 2026, residents of the UAE are in for a rare treat as six planets align in a ""planetary parade"" across the night sky.While Dubai's city lights are famous, the real show will happen far above the skyscrapers, with the Al Qudra Desert serving as the ultimate front-row seat for this astronomical event.Venus and Jupiter will anchor the show, serving as the easiest planets to find as they shine like brilliant white beacons in the twilight. Mars will be equally recognizable, standing out with its distinct and steady reddish-orange hue that separates it from the flickering stars nearby.While these brighter planets are visible to the naked eye, the ""Hidden Giants""—Uranus and Neptune—are tucked much farther away in the depths of the solar system. To glimpse these icy distant worlds, experts recommend bringing a pair of basic binoculars or a small telescope to pull their faint light into view.Adding to the night's beauty, the Moon will also join the party, perfectly positioned near the alignment to act as a natural guidepost, helping you trace the planets' path across the sky.While the planets won't wait for anyone, there is a ""golden window"" to catch them at their clearest. The parade officially begins shortly after the sun dips below the horizon.You don’t have to be in the Al Qudra desert to enjoy the show. If you are outside of Dubai, here are the prime viewing spots where the ""Planetary Parade"" will be just as spectacular:A planetary alignment occurs when the planets’ orbits bring them to the same side of the Sun from Earth’s perspective. While it looks like they are standing in a line, they are actually millions of miles apart in space, it is simply a beautiful trick of geometry.This specific six-planet parade is considered rare because of the number of planets involved and their high visibility in the northern hemisphere. For many in the UAE, this event is more than just science; it is a moment of reflection and wonder during a holy month dedicated to looking toward the heavens.","Venus and Jupiter will be the first to ""ignite"" in the sky as twilight fades. The alignment will still be high enough above the horizon to avoid being blocked by buildings or distant dunes. This specific six-planet parade is considered rare because of the number of planets involved and their high visibility in the northern UAE.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128637564,imgsize-26310,width-400,resizemode-4/dubai-sky.jpg"

Japan’s legendary Samurai: Unveil the mysterious legacy of knights from fearsome swordsmen to masterful artists,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/japans-legendary-samurai-unveil-the-mysterious-legacy-of-knights-from-fearsome-swordsmen-to-masterful-artists/articleshow/128598045.cms,"AI Generated

Japan’s samurai warriors: History and origin



Samurai were more than warriors: Skills went beyond the sword

Are samurai only men



What do samurai wear when off the battlefield



What is the meaning of the word ‘samurai’



Do samurai exist today







What comes to your mind when you hear the term ‘samurai’? For most people, the imagination rolls out like men on the battlefield, clad in armour, wielding a sword, and unwavering in loyalty. From the medieval period, the story began during that period with an over 1000-year history, which holds great significance in understanding the evolution.The legacy of the samurai from the medieval cultural history years ago to today has been relentlessly celebrated as part of the contemporary video games, TV shows, films, and more. The samurai were believed to be the knights of old, as fearless, loyal, disciplined Japanese warriors from the ukiyo-prints of the 18th century to the present. But the story isn’t that simple; it is quite complex and more surprising than what Hollywood reveals.According to the British Museum’s new Samurai exhibition, the samurai, who are often imagined as part of a fantasy world, are not only featured in Star Wars or popular video games but were also real, mysterious warriors with a rich and compelling history. Their lives were disciplined, marked by strict codes of honour, and intertwined with both politics and culture.Here’s how the true story of the samurai unfolds.As per the curator of the exhibition, Rosina Buckland, the perception of the samurai as warriors is accurate in terms of how they rose to positions of power. ‘But that’s not everything,’ says Buckland, highlighting their influence beyond battle and warfare.As reported, the origins begin in the 10th century when they were first recruited for the imperial courts as mercenary warriors. By the 12th century, Japan faced a series of open battles on the streets, uprisings, and rebellions, which allowed the samurai to capitalise on the unrest, acquire major political power, and establish a military government (shogunate) in 1185, reshaping the country’s social and political landscape for centuries.The samurai were also open to new ideas and technology from other cultures. For example, a samurai armour on display at the exhibition was based on a Portuguese design, with a pointed front and angled sides to deflect musket bullets. These features became necessary after European firearms arrived in Japan in 1543.Alongside their military skills, samurai learned refined arts like painting, poetry, music, theatre, and tea ceremonies. Military leaders, called Shōguns, realised that brute force alone wasn’t enough to rule effectively. They combined military strength with subtle forms of influence within court society.Their approach to governing was influenced by Chinese philosophy, especially Confucian ideas. Buckland explains, “In Neo-Confucian thought, you need a balance between military power and cultural skill.” This led to an emphasis on soft power, such as diplomacy and courtly culture. The exhibition also displays a 19th-century fan painted by a samurai artist, showing the unexpected artistry of these warriors.From the 12th century to the 16th century, high-ranking women also held great power. For example, Hojo Masako, who was married to the first shogun Minamoto Yoritomo, acted as the regent several times. During the Tokugawa period, half of the samurai class was comprised of women who had important household chores and raised children.As reported, the objects in the British Museum’s exhibition, accessories, robes, and various other objects explains the story of samurai women.According to their ranks, samurai wear outfits depending on their rank. Their outfits might vary from the lavish textiles of high-ranking samurai to imported textiles. This is far different from the low-ranking samurai whose clothing was expressed by wearing long katana and short wakizashi with different mounts. Tsuba is believed to come in all shapes and sizes, which is mostly made of iron but can also be made of copper, brass, or enamel.The term emerges from the Japanese verb ‘saburau’, which means to serve. This hints at the men of origin who served as the governors. And historically, the terms are used to describe the members of the ruling class.Not really. As a distinct social-military class, it no longer exists. As per the reports, their official status ended in the late 19th century when Japan modernised its military and government.However, their legacy lives on. Samurai values like loyalty, discipline, and honour influence Japanese culture. Martial arts such as kendo and iaido, traditional ceremonies, and cultural storytelling still carry their spirit. Samurai armour, swords, and art are preserved in museums, exhibitions, and collections worldwide.","The British Museum’s new Samurai exhibition explains the true story of the samurai.

"'Indian nepotism, no gaming background': Internet slams Microsoft for hiring Asha Sharma as CEO of Xbox",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-nepotism-no-gaming-background-internet-slams-microsoft-for-hiring-asha-sharma-as-ceo-of-xbox-gaming/articleshow/128643266.cms,"The criticism comes amid political debate in the United States, particularly among sections of the MAGA conservative base, where Indian-origin executives and the H1-B visa programme have come under scrutiny. High-profile Indian-origin figures such as FBI director Kash Patel, second lady Usha Vance and former DOGE lead Vivek Ramaswamy have also drawn attention.

Several users also took a closer look at Sharma’s professional history. One post circulating on X reproduced details from her LinkedIn profile and claimed she had “Never held a postion for more than 4 years (climbing the corp ladder)”. The post pointed to her previous roles to question the depth of her long-term leadership experience.

Some of the users defended the decision of Microsoft, arguing that a chief executive does not need to design or play video games to run a gaming business and that the hate against Asha stems from racism against Indians.

Microsoft’s gaming division has faced a difficult decade. After strong competition with Sony and Nintendo, the previous CEO, Spencer, admitted in 2024 that the 2013 Xbox One “lost the worst generation to lose.” The company has spent heavily on acquisitions, including a $69 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard, in a push to expand beyond consoles into PC and mobile gaming. It has also laid off more than 2,500 gaming employees since 2024 and shut several studios.

In an email to staff, Sharma said: “We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world,” she wrote.

She added: “We will celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console, which has shaped who we are.”





A leadership shake-up at Microsoft’s gaming arm sparked online backlash, with gamers accusing the company of “Indian nepotism” after it named AI executive Asha Sharma as the new head of Xbox.Microsoft Corp confirmed that Sharma will take over as chief executive of its gaming division, replacing Xbox boss Phil Spencer, who is retiring.Xbox President Sarah Bond is also set to leave, while games studios chief Matt Booty will become chief content officer, reporting to Sharma. The announcement was made by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in a blog post on Friday.Sharma most recently served as President of Core AI Product at Microsoft and was selected for her consumer and product expertise. She previously held senior roles at Instacart and Meta, and has also sat on the boards of The Home Depot and Coupang.Earlier in her career, she worked in Microsoft’s marketing department before leaving in 2013, only to return two years ago in a senior AI leadership role.However, the appointment has triggered criticism on X, where several users questioned her lack of direct experience in the gaming industry. One user wrote: “Asha Sharma, the new head of Xbox, is an AI executive with no background in gaming.”Another user said that her appointment aligns with the trend of Indians ""stealing"" American jobs in the US: “Microsoft is literally just indian nepotism now. That’s the whole company. Have you wondered why they rolled out an update that bricked hundreds of thousands of computers? Why OneDrive doesn’t work but keeps enabling itself? Why an instacart employee is handling gaming? Indian nepotism. That’s the whole company now.”A further comment read: “I’m sure I need 6 years of software development experience, a 4.0 GPA at a top university, and 20 side projects to get a minimum wage internship at Microsoft, but the CEO knows nothing about video games.”Another user asked: “Why is every American tech company run by Indians now?”","Asha Sharma will take over as chief executive of Microsoft’s gaming division.

What's next?





Travelers crossing the iconic 25-kilometer bridge between Saudi Arabia and Bahrain woke up to a new fee structure this week. For the first time in a decade, the King Fahd Causeway Authority (KFCA) has adjusted its toll rates to help fund ongoing infrastructure upgrades and enhance the digital travel experience.Whether you’re a weekend tourist or a daily commuter, the price to cross the Arabian Gulf's busiest artery has officially shifted gears.Here’s the new toll structure for one-way crossings:These updated fees replace the previous rates (which were 25 SAR for small cars after a 2016 increase).Despite these changes, the Authority has maintained its commitment to social support, confirming that students, people with disabilities, and regular daily commuters holding special transit cards are exempt from the hike and will continue to pay the legacy rates.To balance the new costs, a series of innovative ""Traveler Packages"" has launched exclusively through the Jesr (Causeway) app. These packages are a game-changer for those who cross the border often.The Frequent Traveler Package is the star of the show, offering a massive 40% discount for SAR 850, valid for 40 crossings within a month. For those who visit Bahrain less often, the Occasional Traveler option provides a 20% discount at SAR 1,120, valid for a full year.There is even a Round-Trip deal for SAR 60 that gives weekenders a 15% discount if they return within seven days.The move toward these new rates is part of a larger push to make the King Fahd Causeway one of the world's most technologically advanced borders. By encouraging drivers to use the Jesr app, the Authority aims to eliminate traditional toll-booth congestion.Users can now pay their fees, handle vehicle insurance, and even check a live stream of traffic before leaving home. This digital-first approach ensures that while the trip's cost has evolved, the time spent waiting at the gate is shorter than ever.","The King Fahd Causeway Authority (KFCA) has adjusted its toll rates to help fund ongoing infrastructure upgrades and enhance the digital travel experience.

Al Nasr Mosque opens in Sharjah

Glass dome architecture

20 metres in diameter and 16 metres tall, it covers almost 80% of the mosque roof.

Built from honeycomb-patterned hexagonal glass panels, it reflects light throughout the day.

At sunset, as golden light pours through the dome into the prayer hall, the space appears to glow, creating a spiritually uplifting ambience.

Welcoming worshippers

A new Ramadan landmark







In a city known for its record-breaking skyscrapers, one of its most breathtaking architectural triumphs is tucked away in the historic heart of Oud Metha. The Al Nasr Mosque (also known as the Great Mosque of Al Nasr) stands as a unique masterpiece in the UAE’s landscape. While most traditional mosques feature solid stone domes, Al Nasr breaks the mold with a structure that feels as though it is reaching directly for the sky.In time for the start of Ramadan 2026, Sharjah inaugurated a striking new place of prayer, Al Nasr Mosque, designed to serve over 1,300 worshippers and bring both spiritual and architectural beauty to the community.Sheikh Sultan bin Ahmed Al Qasimi, Deputy Ruler of Sharjah, officially opened the mosque on the evening of the moon-sighting announcement that confirmed Ramadan’s arrival.Located in the Jabal Omar neighbourhood of Al Dhaid, the mosque covers more than 7,800 square metres, providing prayer, reflection, and social space for residents of Sharjah and nearby areas.The architectural centerpiece of Al Nasr Mosque is its large spherical glass dome:Next to the dome rises a 38-metre-tall minaret with gently flowing lines, a modern twist on classical mosque silhouettes that harmonises with the round dome instead of rigidly following tradition.The mosque’s layout has been meticulously designed to foster a sense of both comfort and community, providing ample room for the faithful to gather. The main prayer hall offers an intimate setting for 470 worshippers, while the expansive external courtyard and outdoor prayer zones can accommodate an additional 1,180 male worshippers, ensuring that large congregations can pray together during peak times.A dedicated women’s prayer hall provides a private and serene space for 145 worshippers, bringing the total capacity to over 1,300 people.Beyond its primary function as a place of worship, the mosque serves as a comprehensive community hub. It is equipped with essential amenities, including modern ablution areas, restrooms, and a water station.For the staff and ongoing spiritual guidance, the complex includes an imam’s residence. It also looks toward the future of the community with a public reading library and practical facilities such as a mortuary and ample parking.Inside, the architecture emphasizes openness and serenity; the hall is bathed in natural light, complemented by a modern mimbar (pulpit) featuring soft built-in lighting that enhances the spiritual atmosphere without overwhelming the worshippers.The inauguration of Al Nasr Mosque is part of a much larger, nationwide effort to enhance mosque facilities and support growing congregations across the UAE. In Sharjah, this initiative has driven the construction and renovation of dozens of mosques, ensuring every community has access to a modern, well-equipped place of worship.Across the Emirates, mosques are expanding their roles beyond prayer by launching creative Ramadan programs for families and children to encourage community engagement. These efforts are supported by practical measures, such as providing free parking for worshippers in busy areas, reflecting the UAE's commitment to making the spiritual journey of Ramadan as accessible and rewarding as possible for all.","Sharjah’s new Al Nasr Mosque opens for Ramadan with a breathtaking glass dome.

With Ramadan starting on Wednesday, February 18, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has officially recalibrated the city’s pulse. To accommodate late-night prayers, family gatherings, and shorter office hours, Dubai’s transport network has shifted into high gear.Whether you're chasing the sunset for Iftar or heading to the Masjid for Taraweeh, here is everything you need to know to stay on track.Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) announced the official operating schedule for the Dubai Metro during the holy month of Ramadan, reflecting the city’s altered daily routines and travel rhythms.The timings cover both the Red Line and Green Line services, designed to match shifts in commuting patterns as residents fast, pray and gather throughout the month.These revised hours apply from the start of Ramadan, which authorities confirmed will begin around mid-February 2026. Travel patterns will adapt rapidly once fasting begins.These adjusted hours help residents navigate a month where early mornings and late evening activities are more common, particularly around Suhoor (pre-dawn) and Iftar (sunset breaking of fast).The extended Friday night service until 1 am reflects the city’s social rhythm, as many events and prayers occur later in the evening.Ramadan alters daily life in Dubai: work schedules shift earlier, fasting affects peak travel times, and evening social and religious activities extend late into the night.The RTA says the updated Metro schedule ensures greater convenience and service alignment with people’s needs, especially around prayer times, sunset, and Iftar gatherings.Alongside the Metro, other transport services also feature updated timings:These adjustments ensure public transport supports daily life throughout the fasting period and beyond sunset into the night.Parking in Dubai has received a thoughtful ""Iftar Break."" For 2026, the RTA has implemented a two-shift payment system for all paid zones from Monday to Saturday. This is designed to give your wallet a rest exactly when you need it most.As for Salik (Tolls), the peak hour rate of AED 6 applies from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Outside these hours, it drops to AED 4, and it is completely free between 2:00 AM and 7:00 AM, which is perfect for those traveling for early Suhoor.As Ramadan reshapes daily life across the city, Dubai Metro’s revised schedule ensures residents and visitors can move smoothly from early morning commutes to late-night gatherings.With extended Friday hours and adjusted weekday services, the new timings reflect the rhythm of the holy month, balancing work, worship and family time. Commuters are advised to plan journeys in advance and check official updates from Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority to avoid last-minute rushes during peak Iftar hours.","Dubai's Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) announced the official operating schedule for the Dubai Metro during the holy month of Ramadan.

The most talked-about piece in royal and style circles this week is this sharply tailored Oxford shirt from London label With Nothing Underneath, worn within days by Kate Middleton, Princess of Wales, Meghan Markle , Duchess of Sussex and American Vogue’s editorial heavyweight Chloe Malle.In fashion terms, that is less coincidence and more cultural signal because when three women who define modern power dressing across monarchy, media and Montecito reach for the same quietly confident staple, it tells us that 2026 is not about excess. It is about precision, polish and above all, it is about the enduring magnetism of a perfectly cut shirt.The blue button-down, it seems, is having its royal renaissance as an icon of quintessential British style. The British fashion label is suddenly dominating the style conversation and it is not for a gown or a handbag but the classic blue button-down shirt.The light-blue button-down from London label With Nothing Underneath, popularly known as WNU, has popped up on multiple high-profile figures within days as Kate Middleton, Princess of Wales wore it under a tailored blazer during a visit to Castle Hill Academy in South London to mark Children’s Mental Health Week while Chloe Malle, editorial head of American Vogue, styled it in a video interview alongside icon Anna Wintour . Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, too has worn WNU shirts in the past, including a linen version on her Netflix seriesIt is rare for figures from different royal households, especially ones with distinct personal brands and a top fashion editor to converge on the same piece, which speaks to both the shirt’s versatility and subtle cultural momentum.Founded in 2017 by Pip Durell, a former Tatler and British Vogue professional, With Nothing Underneath specialises in classic shirting inspired by men’s tailoring but sized and proportioned for women. The shirts are inspired by men’s tailoring, British heritage and timeless style, out of Durell’s personal search for shirts that were perfectly adjusted for women, sustainably sourced and stood the test of time.They were borne after years of adjusting men’s shirts for her own use. Combining her fashion knowledge and styling credentials with her own very English, effortless approach to dressing, the brand was launched from her home city of London. Today it has grown to encompass an array of wardrobe essentials, from shirts to tailored trousers, that are not led by trends or fleeting style moments instead, they are designed to be forever items in which to live a life of simplicity. In other words, With Nothing Underneath is not just selling shirts; it is helping define a moment in style that blends classic elegance, accessibility and modern wardrobe versatility.They are pared back, laid back, timeless and effortless clothing and inspired by Carolyn Bessette, Jane Birkin and Charlotte Rampling . The label’s success is measurable with £5.7 million in sales in 2024 and 88% growth over three years. It ranked 52nd on The Sunday Times Hundred list of fastest-growing UK private companies. These numbers suggest that WNU is more than a fleeting celebrity endorsement, it is a brand on the rise.The “Royal effect” still matters. Kate’s sartorial choices have long influenced high street fashion, an impact sometimes referred to as the Kate effect, which can boost British brands by hundreds of millions annually and it is not just high-end. Mainstream retailers are seeing similar spikes. For example:These accessible pieces benefit when “royal style” filters down to everyday wardrobes. This moment also fits a wider fashion pattern in early 2026. Light-blue button-downs are showing up in style guides as versatile essentials for office and casual wear.Colour combinations like pale blue with chocolate brown are being touted as must-try seasonal pairings. Meghan has long embraced similar shirting pieces, reinforcing that timeless tailoring, especially shirts, remains central to polished and “quiet luxury” wardrobes.This is not just about one shirt. It shows how royal wardrobes can shape fashion trends globally. It marks a rare fashion overlap between two of the most watched public figures of the decade and highlights how quality basics, not only flashier pieces, can become cultural touchpoints.","The blue button-down, it seems, is having its royal renaissance as an icon of quintessential British style.

Ctrl+Alt+Elite: Microsoft hands Xbox controller to Asha Sharma,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ctrlaltelite-microsoft-hands-xbox-controller-to-asha-sharma/articleshow/128647822.cms,"Asha Sharma (Photo credit- Microsoft)

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

In a sweeping reset during Xbox’s 25th anniversary year, Satya Nadella-led Microsoft has named Asha Sharma as CEO of Microsoft Gaming, pitching another Indian-American into a leadership position at a time of intense xenophobia in MAGA circles. Wisconsin-born Sharma, 43, succeeds Phil Spencer, the widely admired Xbox chief who is retiring after nearly four decades at the company.Sharma, who has wheeled though Instacart and Meta among other companies as a senior executive, most recently served as President of CoreAI at Microsoft, where she led efforts to embed advanced models into the company’s cloud and developer stack. Before returning to Microsoft, where she had an earlier stint, Sharma was Chief Operating Officer at Instacart, helping steer the delivery platform through its IPO and a volatile post-pandemic reset. Earlier, at Meta, she oversaw product and engineering for Facebook Messenger and Instagram Direct, guiding communications products used by billions.A graduate of the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota, Sharma’s resume reads like a map of the modern tech economy: marketplaces, social platforms, cloud, and AI. Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella praised her “deep experience building and growing platforms,” signaling that the company sees operational discipline and AI integration as critical to Xbox’s next chapter.The appointment immediately ignited debate across gaming forums and social media, with critics arguing she lacks direct experience in game development at a moment when Microsoft Gaming faces declining revenues and the complex integration of the $69 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition. Fans accustomed to Spencer’s gamer-first persona questioned whether an “AI specialist” might privilege algorithms over artistry.Sharma moved quickly to address the concerns in her first memo to staff and in an interview with Variety, acknowledging she has “a lot to learn” about the creative side of the business and vowed to “earn the right to be trusted.” She promised a “return of Xbox,” insisting the company would not chase short-term efficiencies or flood the ecosystem with what she called “soulless AI slop.” Games, she wrote, “are and always will be art, crafted by humans. ”Sharma’s elevation places her among a cadre of Indian-American leaders running major US tech companies, including Nadella at Microsoft and Sundar Pichai at Alphabet/Google, whose subsidiary YouTube is also helmed by Indian-American Neal Mohan. For many, it is another milestone in the continued ascent of Indian-origin executives in Silicon Valley who remain uninhibited in the face of MAGA paranoia.Still, the appointment has unfolded in a fraught political moment. Online, some MAGA-aligned voices have recycled claims of corporate nepotism and “favoring their own,” casting Sharma as part of an “Indian tech-bro” archetype. The backlash comes at a time of heightened scrutiny over H-1B visas and the ""America First"" movement, even as Sharma’s background remains firmly rooted in the American Midwest; she was born and raised in Racine, Wisconsin, and built her career through mainstream US institutions and companies.Industry observers say the backlash reflects broader anxieties—about globalization, immigration, and the dominance of tech—rather than Sharma’s credentials. “In this era, a gaming CEO needs to protect creatives while navigating AI and scale,” one analyst wrote on Reddit. “You don’t need to be a hardcore gamer; you need to be a platform architect.”Microsoft Gaming is valued at roughly $80 billion and spans consoles, PC, cloud gaming, and a portfolio of studios that now includes Activision Blizzard. The mandate before Sharma is formidable: stabilize revenue, extract value from blockbuster acquisitions, and define how AI augments—rather than supplants—creative work.","Asha Sharma, 43, succeeds Phil Spencer, the widely admired Xbox chief who is retiring after nearly four decades at the company.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets. The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

The Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited, commonly known as CIBIL, plays an important role in this regard by providing credit scores to borrowers.According to ET, credit score helps banks make informed decisions about extending credit cards and loans. Your credit history influences your CIBIL score , which is calculated using a special method.Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity. Ranging from 300 to 900, a higher score indicates a stronger likelihood of loan approval. Banks and financial institutions use this score to assess the risk associated with lending money.1. Go to the official CIBIL website and click on 'Personal CIBIL score,' then 'Get Your Free CIBIL score.' Follow the link provided and fill in all the required details.2. If you don’t have a PAN Card, you can use an alternative identification such as Passport, Voter ID, Driver’s License, or Ration Card. Enter the number of the chosen ID.3. Provide your date of birth, PIN code, and select your state. Finally, enter your mobile number and click on ‘Accept and Continue’.4. Authenticate your identity by entering the OTP (One-Time Password) delivered to your mobile device on the next screen. Click 'Continue' to proceed.5.

Upon successful registration, you will see a page confirming that 'You have successfully registered!'7. Click on ‘Go to Dashboard’ to access and view your CIBIL score.The factors influencing the new CIBIL score, as stated on the CIBIL website, include:1. Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5. Number of new accounts opened and number of accounts closed: Opening or closing accounts can affect your score, so managing these actions wisely is important.","Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity.

Buying luxury property in Dubai just got easier: How buyers can win big in market of high-end homes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/buying-luxury-property-in-dubai-just-got-easier-how-buyers-can-win-big-in-market-of-high-end-homes/articleshow/128065061.cms,"Dubai’s Luxury Property Market Is Crowded: Here’s How Smart Buyers Are Still Winning Big

Million-Dirham Decisions Made Simple: The Tool Luxury Buyers in Dubai Are Quietly Using

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Dubai’s ultra-luxury property segment, including homes priced above Dh20 million, remains one of the hottest real estate markets globally, drawing affluent local and international investors alike. However, while listing volumes are high, identifying the right inventory with real market value and credibility can still be challenging.With hundreds of luxury transactions recorded annually, including more than 750 properties above Dh50m and over 250 valued above Dh100m in 2025 alone, the challenge for affluent buyers is not just seeing inventory but identifying the right opportunities backed by real market behaviour. Platforms like Bayut are simplifying this process with data-led tools, verified listings and specialist agent networks designed to empower discerning buyers.Instead of simply providing endless listings, Bayut focuses on three core pillars of data insights, verified availability and expert partnerships to help buyers separate signal from noise in a dynamic market environment.One of the biggest challenges for luxury buyers is knowing whether a listed price reflects actual market activity rather than wishful thinking.Bayut tackles this by offering transaction-backed insights, drawing on official Dubai Land Department (DLD) records, so that buyers can see what similar properties are really achieving in terms of sales volume and pricing.In 2025, Dubai recorded thousands of high-value property sales, including more than 750 transactions for properties above Dh50 million and over 250 above Dh100 million, underscoring both demand and the need for accurate context. This type of benchmark pricing helps buyers understand if a property is competitively priced, overpriced, or a rare value play — a crucial step before making multi-million-dirham commitments.Luxury real estate is not just about price tags, it is about deep market knowledge, negotiation experience and access to exclusive opportunities. Bayut’s ecosystem highlights specialist agents with proven track records in high-value transactions, rather than generalists who may be active across all segments.Programs like TruBroker, Bayut’s quality standard for agent credibility, help buyers identify intermediaries who are consistent, data-savvy and focused on premium markets. This makes it easier to form partnerships with professionals who understand how to position offers, anticipate buyer preferences and secure coveted properties.Luxury inventory, especially at the very top end, can be distorted by outdated listings, duplicate posts or units that are no longer available. Bayut’s technology emphasises verified listings through tools like TruCheck and cross-referencing with systems like DLD’s Madmoun to ensure that a property you’re considering is truly active and not a relic of old marketing efforts.This verification helps buyers avoid wasted time and misaligned expectations, accelerating decision-making and reducing friction in negotiations.Luxury buyers also benefit from tools that help them evaluate whether asking prices make sense relative to market benchmarks. Bayut’s TruEstimate offers valuation estimates, historical price movement analysis and demand indicators that serve as a sense check for where a property stands, helping buyers discern possible overpricing or hidden opportunity without removing the emotional appeal of design or location.Such analytical signals are especially valuable in a segment where architectural uniqueness or waterfront views can command premium pricing that may not be immediately intuitive.High-end property purchases often emerge from long-term observation rather than last-minute decisions. Features like portfolio tracking (where buyers can keep an eye on pricing trends, status shifts and comparisons across multiple shortlisted properties), give investors a structured way to monitor the market over time, rather than making impulsive choices.This kind of forward-looking visibility keeps serious buyers informed about pricing shifts, new inventory that enters the high-end space, and when timing might be right to make a move. As Dubai continues to attract wealthy buyers from Europe, Asia and the Gulf with significant activity in places like Palm Jumeirah, Dubai Hills Estate and Mohammed Bin Rashid City, the need for clarity and confidence in property selection has never been greater.Bayut’s combination of transaction-backed data, verification, specialist networks and valuation insights positions it not just as a listing portal but as a trusted guide through one of the world’s most dynamic luxury markets. In an era where information overload can mislead as easily as it informs, access to accurate data, specialised expertise and transparent tools helps buyers make smarter and more efficient decisions, whether they are picking a trophy asset or a strategic long-term investment.","Dubai’s ultra-luxury property segment, including homes priced above Dh20 million, remains one of the hottest real estate markets globally.

Salesforce selects four Indian nonprofits for its Agents for Impact AI Accelerator; Offers Rs 6.8 crore in grants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/salesforce-selects-four-indian-nonprofits-for-its-agents-for-impact-ai-accelerator-offers-rs-6-8-crore-in-grants/articleshow/128650391.cms,"Salesforce has launched its Agents for Impact accelerator in India, granting Rs 6.8 crore to four nonprofits. This initiative provides free technology and expert support for six months, enabling organizations to build AI agents for tasks like donor outreach and application processing.

Four nonprofits, four very different use cases

The larger bet Salesforce is making on AI and social impact

Salesforce has launched the India cohort of its Accelerator—Agents for Impact program, picking four nonprofits to receive grants, free technology access, and hands-on expert support to build custom AI agents. The total grant pool sits at Rs 6.8 crore, spread across the cohort, with each organization also getting free Salesforce technology for up to 18 months and pro bono consulting from Salesforce employees.The six-month program is built around a straightforward problem: nonprofits in India are stretched thin, running lean teams across wide geographies, and burning time on administrative work that AI could handle. The idea is to let agents take over routine tasks—donor outreach, volunteer coordination, application processing—so staff can focus on the actual work.The inaugural cohort reflects just how varied those needs can be. Antarang Foundation is building a Career Facilitator Agent that pulls each student's profile data to generate personalized counseling sessions.Foundation For Excellence is developing a Scholarship Agent to speed up student application reviews. Latika, which works with people with disabilities, is creating a Legal Navigator Agent to walk users through acquiring disability certificates, pensions, and tax relief—step by step. And Teach for India is deploying a Teaching Assistant trained on its Firki teacher-training platform, designed to answer queries and direct teachers to the right courses.Arundhati Bhattacharya, President and CEO of Salesforce South Asia, framed the initiative around reclaiming human capacity rather than replacing it. Her argument: when AI handles complexity, people are freed up for the work that actually requires human judgment and empathy.The program is part of Salesforce's global Agents for Impact accelerator, with the India cohort marking the country's first entry into what the company positions as a long-term push to make agentic AI accessible beyond the corporate sector.","Salesforce has launched its Agents for Impact accelerator in India, granting Rs 6.8 crore to four nonprofits.

Price spikes and “RAMmageddon”



Industry fallout due to global chip crisis



Echoes of past supply chain shocks



Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Xiaomi President Lu Weibing and many others are warning about a global crisis unfolding: Shortage of memory chips. The scarcity of memory chips led to their soaring costs. As a report in Bloomberg says it is beginning to hammer profits, derail corporate plans and inflate price tags on everything from laptops and smartphones to automobiles and data centers — and the crunch is only going to get worse.As per the Bloomberg report, the main driver of the squeeze is the buildout of AI data centers. Companies like Alphabet and OpenAI are buying millions of Nvidia AI accelerators, each needing a massive amounts of DRAM. This has left the consumer electronics maker fighting over dwindling supplies from Samsung and Micron. Elon Musk has also suggested that Tesla may need to build its own fabrication plant, “he said in January.The report also adds that the memory prices are increasing and going at an unprecedented levels. One of the type of DRAM jumped by 75% in a single month, with retailers adjusting prices daily. Industry insiders have dubbed the crisis “RAMmageddon.” Tim Cook warned that iPhone margins will be compressed, while Micron called the bottleneck “unprecedented.”The report also revealed the industry fallout on the global chip crisis.The report adds that Sony may delay its next PlayStation console to 2028 or 2029. Also, Nintendo is also thinking raising the prices of Switch 2. Xiaomi and Oppo may also cut shipment forecasts for 2026. Cisco cited the memory squeeze in a weak profit outlook, triggering its worst share loss in nearly four years. Lastly, Qualcomm and Arm Holdings also warned of more fallout.This global chip crisis recall the Covid-era chip shortages, but this time the driver is AI. Tech giants Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Google are pouring hundreds of billions into AI infrastructure, diverting memory production toward high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for AI accelerators. That leaves less capacity for standard DRAM used in everyday electronics.Bernstein’s Mark Li says memory prices are going “parabolic.” Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing warned the crunch will last at least through the year. Counterpoint Research estimates DRAM shortages will persist across electronics, telecom, and automotive industries, with signs of panic buying already visible.",Report: Shortage of memory chips led to soaring costs.

Google responds to the lawsuit

Popular radio show host David Greene has sued Google , alleging the tech giant of ‘stealing’ his voice for its NotebookLM tool, which uses AI to create on-demand podcasts. The lawsuit, filed in Santa Clara County alleges that Google cloned Greene’s voice and distinctive broadcasting style without permission or compensation. Greene argues that Google’s NotebookLM T tool voice's rhythm, intonation, and even his characteristic verbal tics are so similar that even his friends, colleagues, and listeners assumed he'd licensed his voice to Google.“So... I’m probably the 148th person to ask this, but did you license your voice to Google? It sounds very much like you!,” a former co-worker asked David Greene in a fall 2024 email, a Washington Post report says.“I was, like, completely freaked out,” Greene told the publication, adding “It’s this eerie moment where you feel like you’re listening to yourself.”Greene said the AI voice sounds very similar to his own, and that the impact goes beyond losing a chance to make money from his best-known asset. “My voice is, like, the most important part of who I am,” Greene reportedly said.In the lawsuit, Greene’s lawyer argues that the recordings make the resemblance clear.“We have faith in the court and encourage people to listen to the example audio themselves,” said Joshua Michelangelo Stein, a partner at the firm Boies Schiller Flexner.Google responded denying the allegations. Google spokesperson José Castañeda told Washington Post: “These allegations are baseless. The sound of the male voice in NotebookLM’s Audio Overviews is based on a paid professional actor Google hired.”The Washington Post reported, “The lawsuit is the latest to pit the rights of individual human creators against the rights of a burgeoning AI industry that promises to transform the economy by enabling the on-demand generation of stunningly lifelike speech, prose, images, and video. Behind the artificial voices found in tools like NotebookLM are language models trained on vast libraries of real-life human text and speech. The humans used to train these models are unaware that their words and voices will be used by AI, raising serious questions about copyright and ownership.”","Popular radio show host David Greene has sued Google, alleging the tech giant of ‘stealing’ his voice for its NotebookLM tool, which uses AI to create on-demand podcasts.

Sarvam’s Indus AI chatbot availability

Sarvam, an Indian artificial intelligence startup working on AI models for Indian languages and users, has launched its Indus chat app for web and mobile platforms. With this move, the company enters a crowded generative AI market that is currently led by global players such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Google with their respective AI chatbots – ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini, respectively. The launch comes days after Google CEO Sundar Pichai said he is impressed with. Speaking at India AI Impact Summit 2026, Pichai specifically highlighted Sarvam AI for developing local AI models tailored to Indian languages and contexts saying ""The work Sarvam has done developing local AI models ....I just don't see any impediments to that, and I think it is very, very well positioned"".Indus works as a chat interface for Sarvam’s newly announced 105B model, a large language model with 105 billion parameters. It allows users to type or speak questions and receive responses in text or audio. Users can sign in using their phone number, Google or Microsoft account, or Apple ID. For now, the service appears to be limited to users in India.Sarvam has said the app has some limitations in its early version. Users cannot delete chat history without deleting their account, and there is no option to turn off the app’s reasoning mode, which can slow responses.The app was launched two days after Sarvam introduced its 105B and 30B models at the AI Summit held in New Delhi earlier this week. At the event, the company also shared details about its enterprise plans, hardware roadmap, and partnerships with firms such as HMD and Bosch.The Indus app is currently available in beta on iOS, Android and the web. Access may also be limited due to restricted computing capacity.“We’re gradually rolling out Indus on a limited compute capacity, so you may hit a waitlist at first,” Sarvam co-founder Pratyush Kumar said in a post on X.Founded in 2023, Sarvam has raised $41 million from investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners, Peak XV Partners and Khosla Ventures, as it builds AI models designed specifically for Indian users.","Indus works as a chat interface for Sarvam’s newly announced 105B model, a large language model with 105 billion parameters.

What Wikipedia says on banning Archive Today

English-language edition of Wikipedia has reportedly banned Archive.today website after the archive site was found to direct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack against a blog. Wikipedia editors reportedly discovered that the archive site altered snapshots of webpages to insert the name of the blogger who was targeted by the DDoS. The Archive Today is said to have been running a DDoS (denial of service) campaign against the personal blog of engineer Jani Patokallio for over a month. Archive.today, also known as archive.is, is an archiving service similar to sites like the Internet Archive. Archive.today uses advanced scraping methods, and is generally considered more reliable than the Internet Archive. The website is widely cited online, including on Wikipedia.In January this year, Patokallio wrote that since January 11, Archive Today has included a piece of JavaScript that makes a visitor's browser open his blog in the background, triggering a massive DDoS attack. As for those unaware, a DDoS attack targets websites and servers by disrupting network services in an attempt to exhaust an application's resources.The perpetrators behind these attacks flood a site with errant traffic, resulting in poor website functionality or knocking it offline altogether.An update on Wikipedia’s Archive.today discussion says: There is consensus to immediately deprecate archive.today, and, as soon as practicable, add it to the spam blacklist (or create an edit filter that blocks adding new links), and to forthwith remove all links to it. There is a strong consensus that Wikipedia should not direct its readers towards a website that hijacks users' computers to run a DDoS attack (see WP:ELNO#3). Additionally, evidence has been presented that archive.today's operators have altered the content of archived pages, rendering it unreliable. Those in favor of maintaining the status quo rested their arguments primarily on the utility of archive.today for verifiability. However, an analysis of existing links has shown that most of its uses can be replaced. Several editors started to work out implementation details during this RfC and the community should figure out how to efficiently remove links to archive.today.The underlying reason for the DDoS attack is said to be a public spat between the Archive's operator and Patokallio, revolving around a blog post from 2023, where the researcher looked into what makes Archive Today work well. As for what triggered the ban, Wikipedia says: 'In January 2026, the maintainers of Archive.today inserted malicious code in order to perform a distributed denial of service attack against a person they were in dispute with. Every time a user encounters the CAPTCHA page, their internet connection is used to attack a certain individual's blog. This obviously raises significant concerns for readers' safety, as well as the long-term stability and integrity of the service. The JavaScript code which causes this is still live on the website. However, a significant amount of people also think that mass-removing links to Archive.today may harm verifiability, and that the service is harder to censor than certain other archiving sites. As of 19 February 2026, the malicious code remains active. It is highly recommended not to visit the archive without blocking network requests to gyrovague.com to avoid being part of the attack.'",Wikipedia banned Archive.today website after it was found to direct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack against a blog.
