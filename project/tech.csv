What are 'Kiss Cams'

Who are Andy Byron and Kristin Cabot

A 'Kiss Cam' moment broadcast at a Coldplay concert Astronomer CEO Andy Byron and the firm’s chief human resources officer, Kristin Cabot. While featuring loved-up twosomes during the show, a camera panned over to a man who had his arms wrapped tightly around a woman, according to videos online. As soon as the two realised that they were on camera, the dup scrambled to hide their faces. The man, later identified as Andy Bryon, immediately ducked out of view while the woman, Kristin Cabot , hid her face in apparent embarrassment.Their reaction seems to have puzzled Chris Martin, the lead singer of Coldplay, who jokingly said, ""Oh, look at these two. You're all right. You're OK. Oh, what? Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy.""So what are these ""Kiss Cams"" that outed the tech CEO's affair.

When the camera zooms in on a pair, the unspoken expectation is for them to share a kiss, often to the cheers and applause of the crowd.While intended as light-hearted fun and a way to foster communal enjoyment, these moments can sometimes lead to unexpected reactions, ranging from shy giggles to viral, awkward encounters. As seen in recent events, frontman Chris Martin might even playfully comment on the on-screen interactions, adding to the impromptu entertainment. The 'Kiss Cam' serves as a simple yet effective tool to engage thousands of concertgoers, transforming passive spectators into active participants in a memorable moment.As per his LinkedIn profile, Andy Byron has been CEO of Astronomer since July 2023. Before this, he has held senior-level roles at cybersecurity and software companies. The US-based Astronomer is valued at $1 billion. In May 2025, the company announced it has secured $93 million in Series D funding led by Bain Capital Ventures, alongside Salesforce Ventures and existing investors including Insight, Meritech, and Venrock, with Bosch Ventures seeking to participate.Kristin Cabot joined in July 2023, per his LinkedIn profile.

K’Andre Miller to Carolina Hurricanes: A new beginning



FAQs

1:Where has K’Andre Miller been traded to?

2: For how much time was K’Andre Miller with the Rangers?

3: Did Addison Clark ever reveal what her tattoo looked like?

As NHL defenseman K’Andre Miller prepares for a new season with the Carolina Hurricanes, his girlfriend, Addison Clark, chose to fill her free time in New York with an unplanned yet chic day. Her latest Instagram Stories showed her entering a tattoo parlor and then having a not-so-janky steak lunch somewhere in the city. While Miller takes a new leg in professional life, an enjoyable afternoon outing like that for Addison offers a little bit of normalcy amid the changing and going away.All throughout the weekend, social media had several sneak peeks from Addison Clark’s New York day. One of her Instagram Stories was captioned “Spontaneous Tattoos Today.” Wearing clean all-black garb contrasted by sneakers and a pearl necklace, she captured a mirror selfie inside the tattoo studio. The tattoo design itself was not shown, but the point was clear: unplanned fun and self-expression.It wasn't over until this act of spontaneity. In Addison's subsequent post, the grilled steak was put out to show on the wooden board, complete with dipping sauces of ketchup and mayonnaise.A simple but satisfying lunch punctuated an otherwise quiet Saturday, possibly one of her last days in New York before moving a little closer to K'Andre Miller's new hometown.The 24-year-old K’Andre Miller was traded in a blockbuster sign-and-trade offseason deal. He inked an eight-year contract worth $60 million, while the Rangers secured the young Scott Morrow and two future draft choices. A former first-rounder, after thanking the Rangers and their fans on Instagram, Miller shared his thoughts on how New York had influenced his early days in the NHL.Though K’Andre Miller heads towards Carolina, these sentient New York moments for Addison Clark seem like a quiet nod to the life they're bidding adieu to. Her spur-of-the-moment tattoo and casual lunch bring forth a very human side of big changes in the big leagues: personal rituals, meaningful farewells, and fresh starts.Also Read: Nicholas Sykora signs with Owen Sound Attack to venture beyond his father’s shadow K’Andre Miller was traded by the New York Rangers to the Carolina Hurricanes.The timeframe during which Miller was with the Rangers was from 2020 to 2024, adding up to five seasons and 368 games.: No, she did film the process in the studio, but purposely kept the tattoo itself a mystery.","K’Andre Miller was traded by the New York Rangers to the Carolina Hurricanes.

BRUSSELS: In a small, refrigerated room at a Brussels university, parka-wearing scientists chop up Antarctic ice cores tens of thousands of years old in search of clues to our planet's changing climate.Trapped inside the cylindrical icicles are tiny air bubbles that can provide a snapshot of what the earth's atmosphere looked like back then.""We want to know a lot about the climates of the past because we can use it as an analogy for what can happen in the future,"" said Harry Zekollari, a glaciologist at Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB).Zekollari was part of a team of four that headed to the white continent in November on a mission to find some of the world's oldest ice -- without breaking the bank.Ice dating back millions of years can be found deep inside Antarctica, close to the South Pole, buried under kilometres of fresher ice and snow.But that's hard to reach and expeditions to drill it out are expensive.A recent EU-funded mission that brought back some 1.2-million-year-old samples came with a total price tag of around 11 million euros (around $12.8 million).To cut costs, the team from VUB and the nearby Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) used satellite data and other clues to find areas where ancient ice might be more accessible.- Blue ice -Just like the water it is made of, ice flows towards the coast -- albeit slowly, explained Maaike Izeboud, a remote sensing specialist at VUB.And when the flow hits an obstacle, say a ridge or mountain, bottom layers can be pushed up closer to the surface.In a few rare spots, weather conditions like heavy winds prevent the formation of snow cover -- leaving thick layers of ice exposed.Named after their colouration, which contrasts with the whiteness of the rest of the continent, these account for only about one percent of Antarctica territory.""Blue ice areas are very special,"" said Izeboud.Her team zeroed in on a blue ice stretch lying about 2,300 meters (7,500 feet) above sea level, around 60 kilometres (37 miles) from Belgium's Princess Elisabeth Antarctica Research Station.Some old meteorites had been previously found there -- a hint that the surrounding ice is also old, the researchers explained.A container camp was set up and after a few weeks of measurements, drilling, and frozen meals, in January the team came back with 15 ice cores totalling about 60 meters in length.These were then shipped from South Africa to Belgium, where they arrived in late June.Inside a stocky cement ULB building in the Belgian capital, they are now being cut into smaller pieces to then be shipped to specialised labs in France and China for dating.Zekollari said the team hopes some of the samples, which were taken at shallow depths of about 10 meters, will be confirmed to be about 100,000 years old.- Climate 'treasure hunt' -This would allow them to go back and dig a few hundred meters deeper in the same spot for the big prize.""It's like a treasure hunt,"" Zekollari, 36, said, comparing their work to drawing a map for ""Indiana Jones"".""We're trying to cross the good spot on the map... and in one and a half years, we'll go back and we'll drill there,"" he said.""We're dreaming a bit, but we hope to get maybe three, four, five-million-year-old ice.""Such ice could provide crucial input to climatologists studying the effects of global warming Climate projections and models are calibrated using existing data on past temperatures and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere -- but the puzzle has some missing pieces.By the end of the century temperatures could reach levels similar to those the planet last experienced between 2.6 and 3.3 million years ago, said Etienne Legrain, 29, a paleo-climatologist at ULB.But currently there is little data on what CO2 levels were back then -- a key metric to understand how much further warming we could expect.""We don't know the link between CO2 concentration and temperature in a climate warmer than that of today,"" Legrain said.His team hopes to find it trapped inside some very old ice.

A restaurant in northern China has sparked outrage after offering customers the chance to cuddle lion cubs while enjoying afternoon tea.Animal welfare groups and social media users are slamming the experience as exploitative and dangerous.The Wanhui restaurant is situated in Taiyuan City in Shanxi province. It allows guests to handle the young lions as part of a four-course tea set, priced at 1,078 yuan ($150). Since opening in June, the venue has been selling around 20 tickets daily for the experience, which also features other animals such as llamas, deer, and turtles. Videos and photos of customers cradling the lion cubs have gone viral on Chinese social media platforms like WeChat and Weibo.Animal rights advocates have condemned the practice, warning of both ethical and safety concerns. “Tearing lion cubs from their mothers so diners can handle them over afternoon tea is exploitation, not entertainment. These animals are living, feeling beings, not toys,” Jason Baker, Senior vice president at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), told news agency Reuters.Baker also criticised the trend of using animals for viral content, adding, “The animals were treated like nothing more than social media props.”Peter Li, a policy expert on China for Humane World for Animals, also raised concerns about the risks involved. “Exploiting wild animals for selfies and marketing gimmicks is not only appallingly bad animal welfare, it's also potentially risky for customers,” he was quoted as saying to Reuters. “Even a young lion is capable of lashing out and injuring a human. So, treating wild animals like props is both morally unacceptable and dangerously irresponsible. ”Despite the backlash, the restaurant has defended itself, claiming the cubs are in good health and under professional care. “They were taken care of very well, with specialised carers to tend to them,” a representative told Reuters.This incident follows another controversial hospitality service in China last month, when authorities launched an investigation into a hotel in Chongqing for its so-called “wake-up service” using red pandas. The animals were allowed to climb onto guests’ beds to rouse them in the mornings, drawing similar criticism from animal rights groups.",The Wanhui restaurant is situated in Taiyuan City in Shanxi province.

Dubai’s switch to cubic meters for water bills: Why it matters more this summer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubais-switch-to-cubic-meters-for-water-bills-why-it-matters-more-this-summer/articleshow/122794842.cms,"DEWA updates its billing units to cubic meters, aligning Dubai with global water measurement standards/Representative Image

TL;DR:

DEWA replaced gallons with cubic meters for water billing in March 2025.





The change aligns with global standards and simplifies consumption tracking for residents. Summer months typically cause about 18% surge in water usage in the UAE, making this metric shift especially timely.

No change in water tariffs, only the measurement unit is different.













Why Did DEWA Make the Switch?





Has Pricing Changed?





Summer Water Consumption in Dubai





How Residents Can Track Their Usage

View daily, weekly, and monthly water usage.





Receive alerts on unusual consumption spikes.





Compare usage against similar households.









A Regional Comparison

Abu Dhabi’s ADDC (Abu Dhabi Distribution Company) uses cubic meters for water billing.





Saudi Arabia’s National Water Company also uses cubic meters.





Qatar’s Kahramaa follows the metric system.





Bahrain, however, continues to use gallons, though a news report from June 2025 indicates that a switch to cubic meters is under consideration for 2026 to standardize measurements across the region.







Why Measurement Matters









Dubai’s ongoing efforts to improve sustainability and transparency took a notable step in March 2025, when the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) transitioned its water billing units from gallons to cubic meters. While initially seen as a technical tweak, the change is proving particularly useful now, as residents face the UAE's hottest months when water consumption spikes.According to the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy’s 2025 Mid-Year Review, water usage in the emirate typically increases during summer (June to September) due to higher demand for cooling, irrigation, and personal use. This makes the cubic meter-based billing system a timely tool for both locals and expats trying to better manage costs and consumption.The switch to cubic meters was officially announced by DEWA in March 2025, aligning Dubai's utility billing with global norms where cubic meters are the standard metric unit for water measurement. The earlier system based on imperial gallons often confused residents unfamiliar with non-metric measurements.One cubic meter equals 1,000 liters, roughly 220 imperial gallons, providing a clearer and more relatable unit for residents who wish to monitor and adjust their consumption patterns.DEWA emphasized that the change aims to enhance transparency, simplify billing, and support sustainability goals set under Dubai's Clean Energy Strategy 2050.Despite the unit shift, DEWA has confirmed that tariff rates remain unchanged. Consumers are paying the same per cubic meter as they previously did per the equivalent gallon-based metric. This was clearly outlined in DEWA’s official statement on the change.The update is administrative, aimed at measurement clarity rather than cost increase. The tiered pricing system based on slab consumption continues as before, with higher usage resulting in higher per-unit charges.Summer in the UAE sees a considerable uptick in resource consumption, particularly water. The Dubai Statistics Center’s 2024 Annual Report noted that water consumption typically rises by 18-20% during summer months, driven by air conditioning cooling systems, gardening, and increased household use.This trend has already been observed in June and July 2025, where DEWA's smart meters have recorded above-average usage compared to earlier in the year, as per DEWA’s internal consumption bulletins shared in June 2025.To help residents stay informed, DEWA offers the Smart Living Program via its smart app, where users can:Since the shift to cubic meters, these tools have become more intuitive for residents who were previously unfamiliar with gallon-based measurements.Dubai is not alone in adopting cubic meters. In the wider GCC region:Switching to cubic meters is not merely a bureaucratic update, it helps residents make international comparisons, better understand their environmental footprint, and align with Dubai’s 30% water use reduction target by 2030, part of the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050.As sustainability and climate resilience become priorities, particularly in water-scarce regions like the Gulf, empowering residents with transparent metrics can help curb overconsumption.While DEWA’s switch from gallons to cubic meters may have seemed like a quiet policy update back in March, its practical benefits are clearer today as Dubai faces peak summer demand. With clearer units and smart monitoring tools, residents are now better equipped to track and control water use, aligning personal utility savings with broader environmental goals.",Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) transitioned its water billing units from gallons to cubic meters in March 2025.

The presence of a culturally diverse workforce in the UAE, Qatar, and Bahrain drives platforms to balance between Arabic, English, Hindi, and Tagalog content offerings.Shahid VIP, owned by Saudi Arabia’s MBC Group, continues to dominate Arabic-language streaming in the GCC.In 2025, it boasts more than 3 million subscribers, per MBC Group's March 2025 statement, thanks to exclusive Arabic series, live TV channels, and original productions tailored to Gulf sensibilities.Similarly, StarzPlay Arabia, headquartered in the UAE, maintains its strong foothold with over 2.1 million active subscribers. StarzPlay is favoured not just for its English-language catalogue but also for partnerships that stream Bollywood films, Turkish dramas, and cricket tournaments like the PSL, catering heavily to the South Asian expat audience.StarzPlay's partnership with Etisalat and STC allows for bundled subscriptions, increasing affordability and reach, particularly in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.While Netflix remains a dominant global player, it has intensified efforts to localise content in the Middle East. In January 2025, Netflix announced an expanded slate of Arabic Originals, including Saudi-produced thrillers and Emirati family dramas. According to Netflix, Arabic-language content consumption on the platform has grown by 40% year-on-year, especially in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.Netflix’s focus on regional storytelling aligns with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, which aims to elevate local entertainment industries. This localisation strategy has enhanced its appeal among Gulf nationals and second-generation expats fluent in Arabic.Expats in the GCC continue to shape streaming preferences. South Asian workers in the UAE and Qatar heavily consume Bollywood films and Indian web series on platforms like Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ Hotstar, although access can vary based on local licensing.Filipino expats largely use iWantTFC, a global Filipino content platform, which reports steady growth in GCC subscriptions as of ABS-CBN’s 2025 mid-year update.Moreover, Turkish dramas dubbed in Arabic, available on Shahid VIP and StarzPlay, remain perennially popular with Arab and non-Arab expats alike. This cross-cultural appeal helps platforms retain diverse demographics.One key constraint for streaming services in the Gulf remains censorship. Both UAE and Saudi Arabia have content regulations that restrict or edit scenes involving nudity, LGBTQ+ themes, and excessive violence. According to Arab News, platforms operating in the GCC must comply with National Media Council guidelines in the UAE and equivalent Saudi regulatory frameworks.This leads to edited versions of global shows, though some platforms provide advisory notices on such edits. Such content moderation has not significantly dampened subscriptions, as users weigh content access alongside regional values.Pricing remains a decisive factor. As of July 2025, here's a snapshot of monthly subscription fees in the UAE (approximate USD conversion):Bundled telecom packages often reduce these costs further. For example, Etisalat’s eLife package includes StarzPlay access, while STC offers Shahid VIP subscriptions with specific plans.In 2025, the Gulf’s streaming ecosystem is dynamic and expat-driven, yet increasingly regionalised. Platforms that blend high-quality Arabic originals with popular global content are thriving, while telecom bundling strategies keep services affordable. As more Gulf countries invest in media and entertainment, the content landscape is set to grow further, serving a cosmopolitan viewer base that toggles between K-dramas, Bollywood hits, Arabic thrillers, and Premier League football.","Shahid VIP and StarzPlay Arabia lead the GCC’s streaming race, with driving demand for Bollywood, Arabic, and Turkish content. Expats favour a mix of global hits and tailored regional content, from Bollywood to Turkish dramas. Regional content production is rising, with Saudi Arabia and UAE leading Arabic originals.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122795832,imgsize-188545,width-400,resizemode-4/122795832.jpg"

Q1. Is it safe to look at the eclipse?

Q2. Am I in the path of totality?

Q3. Should I book my trip now?





In the early afternoon of August 2, 2027, the sun will disappear from the sky, not because of clouds or dust, but because the moon will pass directly in front of it. This total solar eclipse is expected to last over six minutes in some areas, making it the longest eclipse visible on land anywhere this century. It won’t be happening far away, either. Instead, the path of totality will stretch across cities, towns, and historic sites in North Africa and the Middle East, putting millions of people right in the heart of this rare cosmic event.For a region with deep roots in astronomy and science, this moment is more than just a visual spectacle, it’s a chance to reconnect with the cosmos.Most total eclipses occur in remote or oceanic locations that are difficult to access. But the 2027 eclipse puts the Arab world directly in the path of totality, offering ideal viewing conditions, easy access to major cities, and the stunning backdrop of some of the world’s oldest cultural landmarks.The path of totality will be fully visible across:For many residents in Egypt, Libya, and Saudi Arabia, this eclipse offers a once-in-a-century opportunity to witness totality without leaving their homeland.Meteorologists predict the clearest skies will be over eastern Libya and western Egypt regions known for almost no cloud cover in August, making them ideal for observing the eclipse. The biggest challenge will be the extreme heat. In Luxor and nearby areas, temperatures may exceed 43°C (109°F). Many viewers will likely choose shaded spots, air-conditioned hotels, or even Nile river cruises for comfort.In Saudi Arabia and Yemen, weather is less predictable. Coastal and mountainous areas might experience cloud cover that could obscure the eclipse. It’s advisable to keep an eye on local weather forecasts if you plan to watch from these regions.The total solar eclipse will be visible across parts of southern Spain, including cities like Cádiz, Málaga, and Algeciras.When totality begins, the sky will darken quickly. Shadows will sharpen, birds will fall silent, and the air will cool noticeably. One of the most breathtaking sights will be the solar corona, the sun’s ethereal outer atmosphere, visible as a glowing halo around the black silhouette of the moon.This strange and beautiful moment lasts only a few minutes but leaves a lasting impression.This eclipse is not just a scientific event; it’s a chance for education and cultural engagement. With over 88 million people living in the path of totality, expect schools, universities, and astronomy clubs across the region to host viewing events and educational programs.In Egypt especially, where the eclipse passes through iconic historic sites, this event offers a perfect opportunity to blend science, tourism, and cultural storytelling. The Arab world’s ancient astronomical traditions may see a revival during this special time.For a truly unforgettable experience, Luxor is hard to beat. Imagine the moon’s shadow sweeping over iconic ancient temples, the Valley of the Kings, and the Nile River.At exactly 1:02 PM EEST, totality begins in Luxor, lasting an incredible 6 minutes and 19 seconds, one of the longest durations on land this century.This magical mix of rich history and ideal eclipse conditions makes Luxor a must-visit for eclipse enthusiasts from around the world.Only during the brief phase of totality is it safe to view the eclipse without eye protection. At all other times, use certified eclipse glasses or solar viewers.If you’re in cities like Luxor, Benghazi, or Jeddah, yes, you will experience full totality. If you’re in Cairo, Dubai, or Beirut, you will only see a partial eclipse.Yes. Popular viewing locations like Luxor are expected to attract many visitors, and accommodations may fill up quickly.","On August 2, 2027, a total solar eclipse will cross parts of North Africa and the Middle East.

This K-Pop band is making waves with sign language,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/this-k-pop-band-is-making-waves-with-sign-language/articleshow/122803209.cms,"All members — Lee Chan-yeon, Park Hyun-jin, Kim Ji-seok — are hard of hearing





Like other K-pop sensations, Big Ocean sings, raps, dances and attracts swooning fans. But this new group’s meteoric rise is fueled by a skill it seems no other boy band boasts: signing. Band members — Lee Chan-yeon, 27, Park Hyun-jin, 25, and Kim Ji-seok, 22 — are all deaf or hard of hearing. They use the latest audio technology to help make their music, coordinate their choreography with flashing metronomes and vibrating watches, and incorporate Korean Sign Language into videos and performances.“Just like divers rely on signs to communicate underwater, we use sign language to convey meaning where sound alone might fall short,” Lee said. “For us, KSL is not just an element — it’s the heart of our performance.” The group released their debut single, “Glow,” last year, on Korea’s Day of People with Disabilities, and they did their first televised performance incorporating KSL. Soon after, they followed up with “Blow,” a single heavy on English lyrics and American Sign Language.In Sept, they were named Billboard’s rookies of the month, and recently, they made the Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia Entertainment & Sports List.This month, the band performed at an anime festival in Brazil and at a UN tech event in Switzerland before touring Europe for the second time since spring. Their first American tour starts later this month. Big Ocean has 995,000 followers on Instagram and more than 696,000 on TikTok. Fans, who call themselves “Pados” after Korean word for wave, are devoted, and many are learning sign languages from the band, which makes numerous tutorials. But fame was never assured, said Haley Cha, CEO of Parastar Entertainment, Big Ocean’s management company.Even the members sometimes questioned their dream, Cha added. They had alternate careers, and it was not always clear to them or to others what they could achieve in music. Cha said she used a variety of tactics to help them visualise stardom, including taking images of established K-pop idols and replacing the faces with those of the trio.Some in the deaf community, however, worry about the framing of the band, particularly for hearing audiences, as an inspirational narrative about “overcoming” disability that could undermine deaf identity.For their part, the trio’s members seem delighted they inspire people and heartened by the world’s response.","Big Ocean has 995,000 followers on Instagram and more than 696,000 on TikTok.

As the country prepares to mark its 54th National Day, plans for this year’sare already in motion. The reminder came on July 18, known as Union Pledge Day, a date that honors the moment when the UAE’s foundation was first laid.Back in 1971, a group of leaders, led by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, signed an agreement that changed the future of the region. That document, known as the Declaration of the Union, along with the newly drafted UAE Constitution, set the stage for what would officially become the United Arab Emirates later that year, on December 2.Since then, National Day has grown into something more than a holiday. It’s a reminder of how far the country has come, from a newly formed union to a fast-moving, diverse, and forward-thinking nation.

A Broader Pattern in UAE Leadership







In the UAE, where extreme summer heat often limits outdoor activity, the response has been practical and purpose-driven. Initiatives like Abu Dhabi Summer Sports (ADSS) are turning indoor spaces into large-scale, accessible venues for sport and wellbeing. It’s part of a wider national effort, led by figures known for their visible, hands-on approach, to keep the country active, engaged, and connected year-round.That approach was clearly on display during a recent visit to the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC), where the event is being held. His Highness Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Vice President of the UAE, Deputy Prime Minister, and Chairman of the Presidential Court, attended in an active capacity, engaging with organisers, reviewing the venue's facilities, and joining participants in a casual volleyball match.The Abu Dhabi Summer Sports (ADSS) event is a large-scale indoor initiative aimed at encouraging people of all ages to stay active, fit, and healthy throughout the UAE’s hottest months. Organised by the ADNEC Group in partnership with the Abu Dhabi Sports Council, the event brings together a wide range of sports and activities under one roof in a safe, climate-controlled environment.ADSS is built with both scale and purpose.

Its infrastructure includes:What makes the event stand out isn’t just the size but how it’s designed to serve everyone, not just trained athletes or sports clubs.Families, children, casual fitness lovers, and amateurs all have dedicated zones. From kid-friendly setups to structured games parents can join, the environment is curated to encourage shared experiences and long-term engagement in physical wellness.Sheikh Mansour was briefed by organisers on all aspects of the event: the design logic, activity zones, safety measures, and objectives behind the initiative. That includes the strategic aim of sustaining community-wide physical activity during a season where most people typically avoid it.What set this visit apart was not the speeches or the staging, it was the simplicity of it. After his tour, Sheikh Mansour joined a friendly volleyball match, playing alongside everyday participants. No grand announcement, no tightly choreographed ceremony, just a real game, in real time, among the people.This direct involvement aligned with the broader goals of the Abu Dhabi Summer Sports (ADSS) initiative: encouraging people across age groups and skill levels to take part in regular physical activity, even during the peak of summer.Following the visit, Sheikh Mansour commended the overall organisation, noting the event’s accessibility, safety standards, and capacity to host a wide variety of sports. He highlighted its value in promoting community health, supporting active lifestyles, and providing well-equipped, climate-controlled spaces for year-round sport.Sheikh Mansour’s participation fits into a larger national narrative, one where sport and wellness are not just government-supported, but culturally encouraged. Leaders across the Emirates frequently show up at local sports events, and many of them are athletes themselves.A notable example of leadership-driven fitness culture is Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, widely known as Fazza. He is an accomplished endurance rider with numerous international titles and pursues activities like skydiving, scuba diving, and flyboarding. Through his active presence on Instagram, Sheikh Hamdan makes fitness a visible, aspirational part of leadership, inspiring younger generations to embrace an active lifestyle.","Abu Dhabi Summer Sports is a large-scale, climate-controlled event promoting fitness for all ages through over 12 sports and family activities.

It also involved booking appointments to visit the visa centre, submitting paper documents, and generally longer processing times.The new system offers:The updated application platform caters to several visa categories, each with specific requirements:The Embassy of China in Abu Dhabi launched this digital platform on June 30, 2025, followed by the Dubai consulate on July 14, 2025. The move streamlines visa requests, ensuring applicants experience fewer hurdles, faster processing, and a more transparent procedure.Once an application is submitted online, it is reviewed preliminarily. Applicants receive an email notification about their status:This shift is mandatory for all UAE residents applying for Chinese visas, promising a more user-friendly experience with clear instructions and fewer delays.Yes, but only after online approval and receiving your Visa Application Certificate.Yes, appointments are no longer required after online approval.Passport copy, personal photo, NOC, hotel and flight bookings, and other supporting documents.Passports are available four working days after submission.No, exemptions apply for children under 14, seniors over 70, diplomatic passport holders, and some others.",UAE residents must now complete an online application and receive approval before visiting the visa centre to apply for China. The older downloadable PDF forms have been discontinued permanently. Passport collection takes four working days after in-person submission. The Chinese consulate reserves the right to request fingerprinting if necessary.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122643021,imgsize-2956371,width-400,resizemode-4/122643021.jpg"

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Allegations made by Apple against Jon Prosser



What information was leaked by Prosser



What Apple is seeking



Apple has filed a federal lawsuit against popular YouTuber Jon Prosser and Michael Ramacciotti. In the lawsuit, the tech giant has accused them of orchestrating a scheme to steal iOS 26 trade secrets from a development iPhone. The company has accused Prosser of leaking confidential details about its upcoming iOS 26 software. Along with this, the video editor Michael Ramacciotti who is the accomplice of Prosser has reportedly accessed a development iPhone belonging to an Apple employee. The lawsuit claims Ramacciotti broke into his friend Ethan Lipnik's Apple-issued development phone while staying at his home, then showed the unreleased software to Prosser via FaceTime. Prosser allegedly recorded the call and used the footage to create ""reconstructed"" renderings for his YouTube channel.For those unaware, Jon Prosser is the creator of popular YouTube channel called Front Page Tech. He is known for leaking details about Apple products which are not yet released by the company. The lawsuit filed by Apple claims that in January 2025 Prosser gained access to early visuals of iOS 26’s new Liquid Glass design, which resembles a lot to the final version showcased by Apple at WWDC 2025.The Cupertino- based tech giant alleges that Ramacotti, a friend of Apple employee Ethan Lipnik, allegedly used Lipnik’s passcode and then tracked his location to access a development iPhone while staying at his home. During that time Ramacotti made a FaceTime call to Prosser and showed him the unreleased iOS 26 features.Prosser then reportedly recorded that call and later used that to create monetised YouTube content. Apple also claims that Prosser promised payment or future job opportunities to Ramacotti for the leaked information.The YouTuber leaked the details about the redesigned camera app with simplified controls. He also showcased the Liquid Glass design which featured pill-shaped tabs and rounded visuals. Along with this, he also talked about the early previews of the Messages app and other UI elevates which later appeared in iOS 26.Apple is requesting a jury trial and seeking multiple forms of relief:* Injunctive relief to prevent further disclosure of confidential information* Punitive and compensatory damages for trade secret misappropriation* An order requiring defendants to return or destroy any confidential Apple information* Recovery of legal fees and costs* Pre- and post-judgment interestThe lawsuit includes claims under the Defend Trade Secrets Act and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act .",Apple has filed a federal lawsuit against popular YouTuber Jon Prosser and Michael Ramacciotti.

YouTube new monetisation rules: Why the 2025 policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

4. Do the subscriber and watch-time thresholds change?

5. What happens if my channel is flagged for inauthentic uploads?

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety, accountability, and protecting minors from online harassment, inappropriate content, live chat abuse, privacy violations, and potential exploitation during livestreams.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue. Simple re-uploads or minimal edits will not qualify.","On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.
