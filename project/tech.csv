How to play NYT Connections



Don't analyse the connections too deeply.

The game tends to employ simple links such as sounding similar, similar spellings, or common themes.

Example: ""dear"" and ""deer"" tend to be linked by sound, not by some elaborate relationship such as predator and prey.

You have only four guesses per puzzle per day, so every guess matters.

Don't mindlessly click—consider each set carefully before submitting.

Try to come up with at least three connected words confidently before trying a set.

The initial organization is deliberately mischievous to mislead you.

Shuffling the words may allow you to see new patterns or concealed connections.

Shuffle it as a routine to begin and whenever you are stuck.

3-time NFL MVP awardee Tom Brady advised Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders that Day 2 matters more than the draft

15-time Pro Bowler, Tom Brady, shared that Danny Amendola, Julian Edelman, Rodney Harrison, and Wes Welker weren’t all high picks

Also Read:

channel co-host, Mike Majlak, asked 7-time Super Bowl Champion, Tom Brady , “We are talking about going late in the draft. Elephant in the room. Shedeur Sanders . What happened, Tom? Why, why, why did he go so late in the draft?” The 47-year-old FOX Sports broadcaster took a moment of silence before answering that question. He went monosyllabic for a moment and then took a deep breath and said, “That’s a good question.” An X user commented, “Tip toed all around that question.”But that’s not all that the 5-time Super Bowl MVP said. Tom Brady gave a lengthy explanation to that tricky question, only because he could connect with Shedeur Sanders. Only because - he, too, was a late pick! 199th overall pick - 6th round! Drafted by the New England Patriots. Let’s hear about his ordeal and what he advised the 144th pick and rookie quarterback for the Cleveland Browns , Shedeur Sanders.Before going straight to Shedeur Sanders, Tom Brady said, “That’s the problem with media - everyone can just say whatever the f*ck they want and get away with it. It’s kind of unfortunate, coz there actually used to be a lot of integrity in media, and there’s way less now because everyone needs crazy voices to get heard, and it actually, probably hurts a lot of relationships, which is not the goal of broadcasting. It should be to develop, and cultivate, and solve problems, and rather than critiques, I want people to offer solutions all the time.”Bringing his focus to Shedeur Sanders, Tom Brady said, ""So, nobody knows - I actually texted Shedeur coz I have known him very well. I said, “Dude, whatever happens, wherever you go, that’s your first day. Day 2 matters more than the draft.”I was 199! So, who could speak on it better than me? Like, what does that really mean? Use it as motivation. You’re going to get your chances. Go take advantage of it. Wherever you end up going, it’s about your performance. Like, what do you do when you get there? Because you’re gonna get there.”Brady shared, “I was around some of the best players who were undrafted free agents - Rodney Harrison wasn’t a high pick. Julian Edelman wasn’t a high pick. Wes Welker wasn’t a high pick. Danny Amendola - all those guys were phenomenal players.So, what’s it matter? Other than some overhyped day where a lot of people are selling stories and saying, “Alright, this is the big day and this is the draft.”It’s an important day, and it’s fun. I love watching it and seeing it. But, I have also been there on Day 2, and they gotta show up and learn a playbook, learn to be a part of a locker room. There’s a lot of growth that needs to happen.”","7-time Super Bowl Champion, Tom Brady, advised Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders that Day 2 matters more than the draft.

'Pandering to black people': Megyn Kelly has a meltdown over Met Gala’s ‘dandyism’ tribute,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pandering-to-black-people-megyn-kelly-has-melt-down-over-met-galas-dandyism-tribute/articleshow/120982200.cms,"Megyn Kelly Declares ""The Met Gala is Dead"" and Calls Out Obscene Nudity and ""Rosa Parks on Crotch""





Megyn Kelly launched into a furious tirade against the 2025 Met Gala, slamming the prestigious fashion event as a “wannabe version of its old self” and accusing organisers of pandering to Black Americans with an “incomprehensible” theme.Speaking on Tuesday’s episode of The Megyn Kelly Show, the former Fox News anchor took aim at the gala’s theme “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” which celebrated Black dandyism and its influence on fashion. Kelly ridiculed the concept as elitist and politically driven, dismissing it as “leftist academic, gobbledygook, nonsensical talk.”“Once the apex of high fashion culture and A-list celebrity, the gala now looks more like a sad sack D-list past-its-prime wannabe version of its old self,” she said. “It’s closer to today’s Nerd Prom White House Correspondents Dinner than the centre of the celeb and beauty universe as it used to be.”Kelly openly mocked the theme’s intellectual basis, referencing Monica Miller’s 2009 book Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity, which inspired the Met exhibit. “So far we have dandyism, intersection and diasporic identity,” Kelly said. “We’re batting a thousand on the scale of leftist code language that will make liberals sound smarter and feel superior.”She went on to quote Miller’s description of Black dandyism, before blasting it as purposefully obtuse: “The whole point is to lose you and sound smarter than you by saying words that are totally empty and meaningless,” she said.Kelly accused the event of virtue-signalling, saying the gala’s true intent was to “pander to Black people because we love Black people and that makes us good people.” She described the night as “basically Black Lives Matter at the Met,” calling it “a parade of Black Americans, leftists in their dandy style.”“Near as I can figure,” she added, “it appears to mean over-the-top black and white with weird shapes and vaginas showing.”The annual Met Gala, co-chaired this year by stars like Colman Domingo, Pharrell Williams and Lewis Hamilton, was otherwise hailed by fashion critics for celebrating the elegance and defiance of Black style throughout history. But Kelly dismissed the celebration entirely, describing it as a self-congratulatory gathering of elites.“You’re not meant to understand this,” she concluded. “You dumbasses. You have to go to Harvard to understand what these people are saying, how they speak and how they code talk.”The Met Gala reportedly raised $31 million this year.","Megyn Kelly slammed the 2025 Met Gala as a ""wannabe version of its old self"" The former Fox News anchor accused the event of pandering to Black Americans with an ""incomprehensible"" theme.

"Titanic survivor’s haunting letter written days before sinking sells for record £300,000 at auction; here’s what it said",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/titanic-survivors-haunting-letter-sells-for-record-300000-at-auction/articleshow/120680669.cms,"A rare letter penned by Colonel Archibald Gracie , one of the Titanic’s most distinguished survivors, has fetched a record £300,000, a fivefold increase on its estimated price, at an auction in Wiltshire, as a new high price for Titanic correspondence was smashed.The letter, dated April 10, 1912, the very day Gracie boarded the Titanic, offers a chilling glimpse into the final days before disaster struck. Written on a Titanic letter card and postmarked in Queenstown and London, it is ominous in tone, with the following ominous words: ""It is a fine ship but I shall await my journey's end before I pass judgment on her.""Auctioneer Henry Aldridge and Son described it as ""a truly exceptional, museum-grade piece,"" saying it is the record price for a Titanic letter. Survivor letters of Gracie's stature are extremely rare, with this one never previously on the market.The four-page letter, written to a family acquaintance who befriended Gracie at the London Waldorf Hotel, is warm in its reminiscence about his earlier crossings on the Oceanic, remembering, ""Her sea-worthy qualities and yacht-like appearance make me miss her,"" while also marveling at the size of the Titanic.Days later, Gracie would be a participant in one of history's most horrific nights. Following an evening of squash, a dip in the ship's pool, and a Sunday church service, Gracie was rudely awakened at 11:40 pm by the abrupt shutdown of Titanic's engines. Without hesitation, he assisted women and children into lifeboats, procuring blankets to protect them from the cold.When the ship finally went down into the Atlantic waves, Gracie crawled onto an upturned collapsible boat with other survivors. In the blackness, frantic swimmers cried out for assistance, but fear of capsizing prevented those on board from taking on more. Gracie remembered with sorrow that over half the men holding on to the upturned boat died before dawn, exhausted and chilled.""In no instance, I am happy to say, did I hear any word of rebuke,"" Gracie wrote in his later memoir, The Truth About the Titanic, recounting the final moments of those left behind, some offering blessings rather than curses.Col. Gracie's eye-witness account is still one of the most detailed and graphic accounts of the tragedy. The auctioneers titled the letter an invaluable relic, ""It is impossible to overstate the rarity of this lot,"" they added. ""Written by one of the most famous survivors, it captures a moment frozen in time.""","Col. Archibald Gracie was one of the Titanic's most distinguished survivors.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Don't mindlessly click—consider each set carefully before submitting.

Try to come up with at least three connected words confidently before trying a set.

The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

Monaco E-Prix Round 6 highlights





Pit Boost in Formula E double-headers

Nissan driver Oliver Rowland won Part 1 of the Monaco E-Prix on Saturday. He is already leading the Formula E Drivers' Standings this year, and the much-awaited win adds to his score. Nyck de Vries of Mahindra Racing secured the second spot on the podium. Andretti driver Jake Dennis managed to claim the third spot despite a 5-second penalty.The race began with qualifying winner NEOM McLaren’s Taylor Barnard on pole position, followed by good friend — Nissan’s Oliver Rowland — and then Cupra Kiro driver Dan Ticktum, who topped both free practice sessions.The race ended early for TAG Heuer Porsche driver António Félix da Costa, who crashed into the wall and retired. He remains the only Formula E driver in the last five years to have won both pole and the race in the same event — in 2021. He had finished third in the previous race in Miami.Mitch Evans of Jaguar TCS Racing, who won the last Monaco E-Prix, came to a halt during the race and struggled to get going again, losing precious time as others overtook him.Oliver Rowland was among the first to use Attack Mode and established his dominance in the race. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries and TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein came close to Rowland when others took the mandatory Pit Boost. Soon after, Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy moved up to challenge for second position.Where did pole winner Taylor Barnard go? He crashed into the wall and was seen reversing his vehicle to rejoin the race. Andretti driver Jake Dennis could have secured a higher podium finish, but he was hit with a 5-second penalty for overspeeding during the full-course yellow when António Félix da Costa’s car was being removed from the crash site.Pit Boost is a feature introduced in Formula E double-headers. The electric Gen3 Evo cars receive a 10 percent energy boost (3.85 kWh) via a 30-second, 600kW charge in the pit lane. However, a driver can use this advantage only once across the two races in a double-header.","Nissan driver Oliver Rowland won Part 1 of the Monaco E-Prix on Saturday.

Julian Edelman’s Patriots Hall of Fame induction brings back emotional memories for Tom Brady

Tom Brady leans on friendships as he navigates post-retirement life and personal change

After a turbulent year marked by his retirement from the NFL and a very public breakup with supermodel Gisele Bündchen , Tom Brady is finding new reasons to smile—and this time, it’s not about football glory or career milestones. The legendary quarterback recently expressed heartfelt joy over the induction of his longtime friend and former teammate Julian Edelman into the New England Patriots Hall of Fame.Brady and Edelman share a bond that extends far beyond the gridiron. The two created one of the most iconic QB-WR duos in NFL history, helping the Patriots clinch three Super Bowl titles and countless unforgettable moments. Now, with Edelman being honored for his contribution to the franchise, Brady was quick to show his support with a brief yet meaningful message on social media: “You deserve it.”That simple tribute carried the weight of years of brotherhood, perseverance, and mutual respect. For Brady, the recognition of Edelman’s career also seems to represent something deeper—a welcome reminder of loyalty and friendship during a time of personal transformation.Brady’s split from Bündchen after 13 years of marriage understandably shifted much of the media’s focus from his career achievements to his private life. As she has moved on publicly, Brady has been quietly adjusting to life after football and life without one of the most high-profile marriages in sports history.In moments like this—celebrating Edelman’s well-earned accolade—Brady appears to be drawing strength and joy from the unshakable bonds built during his playing days. These relationships, rooted in years of shared sacrifice and trust, seem to provide emotional grounding amid the transitions of retirement and personal reinvention.Brady has always been known for his intensity, discipline, and desire to win. But in this chapter of his life, it’s clear he also values legacy, connection, and loyalty just as much. Honoring Edelman isn’t just a nod to the past—it’s a sign that Brady is looking forward while cherishing the people who helped define his journey.Also Read: “Stop calling me someone’s ex”: Kayla Nicole moves beyond Travis Kelce’s shadow and the Taylor Swift narrative In a time when headlines often blur the personal and professional, Brady’s sincere appreciation for Edelman shows where his heart truly lies: with those who stood beside him through it all.","Julian Edelman was recently inducted into the New England Patriots Hall of Fame.

This decision surprised many (Getty Images)

Fans praise the couple for choosing privacy over publicity at a high-profile event

Travis Kelce’s upcoming podcast episode with his mother reinforces his grounded values

In a move that’s both surprising and telling, power couple Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift chose not to attend the 2025 Met Gala — a decision that has generated a wave of reactions online. While the celebrity event on May 5 showcased A-listers from across the entertainment world, Kelce and Swift were nowhere to be seen, instead opting for a quiet moment away from the flashbulbs and red carpet frenzy.The absence of the NFL star and the global music icon was felt by fans and media alike, but the response has been overwhelmingly supportive. As one social media user put it, “They deserve a break from the chaos. Let them enjoy their lives.” Many echoed similar sentiments, applauding the couple for prioritizing mental health, family, and real-life connection over the performative expectations of fame.This choice aligns with the couple's recent low-profile approach. Since the end of the Kansas City Chiefs’ season and Swift’s recent leg of the Eras Tour, the duo has retreated somewhat from the public spotlight. That intentional withdrawal has resonated with fans, many of whom are inspired by the example they’re setting about personal boundaries in a hyper-connected age.Further reflecting this down-to-earth philosophy is the timing of Travis and Jason Kelce’s upcoming New Heights podcast episode, airing May 7 — just in time for Mother’s Day. The episode will feature the Kelce brothers’ beloved mother, Donna Kelce, in a heartfelt conversation about Travis’s youth football journey.It’s a choice that speaks volumes. Instead of walking the Met Gala red carpet, Kelce is highlighting the people and experiences that shaped his career. It’s not just a PR move — it’s a reminder of what matters to him.Although some followers admitted they were hoping to see Swift and Kelce dressed to the nines on the Met Gala carpet, the overall reaction has been understanding.

Public absence sparks even more questions about their current dynamics

In a surprising turn of events, celebrity power couples Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift , as well as Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds , were noticeably absent from the 2025 Met Gala . While their absence sparked speculation across social media, rumors of rising tension between the two couples are fueling even more intrigue behind the scenes of fashion’s biggest night.Taylor Swift and Blake Lively have long shared a close friendship, often seen supporting each other’s projects and appearing in each other’s social media posts. Likewise, Ryan Reynolds and Travis Kelce are known for their charismatic public personas and sports affiliations. But recently, fans noticed a cooling-off between the two pairs.Reports suggest that differing opinions about public appearances and conflicting schedules may have created subtle rifts. Some insiders claim Swift and Kelce have been seeking more privacy as their relationship deepens, while Lively and Reynolds continue to embrace the spotlight and A-list events like the Met Gala. This divergence may have led to less interaction between the once-tight-knit group.Their collective decision to skip the Met Gala — an event that both Swift and Lively have historically embraced with eye-catching fashion — raised eyebrows. With no official statements from either couple, the absence seems deliberate rather than coincidental. Sources close to the Met Gala planning committee hinted that both couples had initially RSVP’d but backed out last-minute, adding fuel to rumors of interpersonal tension.Social media has been buzzing with speculation, as fans dissect recent photos, social posts, and public appearances for signs of a falling out.

Fans choose ""Mammoth"" to embody Utah's NHL personality

New face same colors and a brighter future for Utah Mammoth

In a significant action for the NHL's latest franchise, the Utah Hockey Club has officially changed its name to the Utah Mammoth. The new name was unveiled following a 13-month review involving more than 850,000 fan submissions. The title pays tribute to the powerful mammoth, a now-extinct animal once found in Utah Mammoth and represents strength, heritage, and community pride. This is the beginning of a new era in Utah hockey, following the team's move from Arizona in 2024.When Ryan and Ashley Smith brought NHL hockey to Utah with the relocation of the Arizona Coyotes in 2024, they had ""Utah Hockey Club"" as a placeholder name. But since day one, they indicated that the fans would influence what comes next. An all-out naming campaign ensued, with fans voting down 20 names to three options: Utah Mammoth, Utah Wasatch, and Utah Hockey Club.Though ""Yeti"" did pick up some steam, legal problems with Yeti coolers prompted the team to pursue another name. The Mammoth name picked up tremendous support, mirroring Utah's prehistoric past where mammoth fossils were discovered statewide. The creatures towered over 14 feet high and weighed over 20,000 pounds. Their power and toughness make them a good fit as a symbol for a team looking to leave its imprint on the NHL.The Utah Mammoth will also stick with the color palette unveiled in their inaugural season: rock black, salt white, and mountain blue. The new black home jerseys boast a prominent mammoth logo featuring snow-covered peaks, the shape of Utah, and a tusk in the shape of the letter ""U."" The white road jerseys retain the ""UTAH"" stair step layout, bringing the state's name to the forefront in away games.Although jerseys will not go on sale to the public until nearer the 2025–26 season, fans can already purchase Mammoth gear at the Delta Center and online next week. During the next NHL Draft in Los Angeles, Utah's new draft selections including the No. 4 overall pick will don Mammoth jerseys for the first time.Read more: Did Utah Hockey Club ""Accidentally"" Leak New Name For 2025-26 Season?","Utah Hockey Club officially rebrands as Utah Mammoth after overwhelming fan vote.

Uncompressed GTA 6 trailers in breathtaking quality now downloadable



Source: Rockstar Games

How does this improved trailer quality benefit fans?



Finally, after all the speculations and fan analysis spanning months, Rockstar Games has published high-quality, uncompressed copies of both Grand Theft Auto VI trailers on their website. The trailers are now available for download by fans in a much better format, with increased bitrates, providing stunning detail and clarity. This enables people to enjoy the finer details that were previously obscured by compression on platforms such as YouTube.The GTA 6 trailers, which have already garnered millions of eyeballs, are now downloadable from Rockstar's official website. These new trailers are being played at 4K resolution and 30 frames per second, but the actual surprise is the enormous bitrate boost. The trailers now run at 63mbps, a huge leap from the YouTube version, which took up approximately 10mbps bitrate, or the Bilibili version with a slightly improved bitrate of 17mbps.The higher bitrate is easily noticeable in the overall quality.

Characters' hair and the smoothness of movements appear much crisper, and the color scheme is much more saturated. This updated version enables fans to fully enjoy the beauty of Rockstar's cinematic work, with many minor details that went unnoticed before now being seen in all their glory.The past year has seen fans analyzing each and every frame of the compressed trailers, to the point where they have dissected the YouTube version and the better quality version on Bilibili. The analyses have offered new information on the game, but the newest official release does away with the need for speculation.The new trailers, downloadable for free, mean that no fan will have to pay to watch them in their highest possible quality. The sharpness of the images and the minute details, previously obscured or blurred, make the trailers a more pleasant experience for fans who wish to see GTA 6's world in the highest fidelity available.By releasing uncompressed, high-bitrate versions of both GTA 6 trailers, Rockstar Games has provided fans with a chance to experience the game's stunning visuals in a way they never have before. As a casual fan or an all-consuming enthusiast, this gesture can only contribute to the hype building around the game's release in 2026. It also demonstrates that Rockstar is dedicated to giving enthusiasts the best experience possible when they are tracking the game's progress closely.Also Read: GTA 6 trailer 2 view count nears 70 million with 4.7 million likes in a day","Uncompressed GTA 6 trailers in breathtaking quality now downloadable from Rockstar's official website.

GTA 6 Trailer: Two trailers down and here’s why a third GTA 6 trailer makes perfect sense,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/gta/two-trailers-down-and-heres-why-a-third-gta-6-trailer-makes-perfect-sense/articleshow/120975070.cms,"Source: Rockstar Games

Now that Lucia and Jason have been revealed, here's why we can anticipate another trailer

Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2

What the third GTA 6 trailer might concentrate on



Rockstar Games officially dropped two trailers for Grand Theft Auto VI , both on one of the game's two protagonists, Lucia in the first and Jason in the second. With a release date now set for May 26, 2026, these have provided a strong narrative foundation. But fans are convinced the most intriguing reveal is yet to come, and there's some reason to believe there will be one final trailer prior to release.Rockstar tends to release multiple trailers before a big launch, and GTA VI is doing that playbook justice. The first trailer revealed Lucia, establishing the tone with her life of crime and foreshadowing her relationship with Jason. The second focused the attention on Jason, providing a more in-depth glimpse at his world and personality.This two-faced introduction feels deliberate, and now that both leads are solidly in place, the marketing campaign appears ready for a change of pace. What comes next? A more in-depth exploration of the game's world and gameplay. In previous games such as GTA V and Red Dead Redemption 2, Rockstar's third trailers tended to unveil open-world gameplay features and larger world-building. The same kind of maneuver with GTA VI would not only be in line with precedent, it would be an ideal means of creating end-stage buzz.The following trailer might provide the most detailed glimpse to date of Vice City, the game's environment. Although glimpses of neon streets, beaches, and nightlife have already gotten fans excited, there's still much more to see, map scale, interactive systems, AI behavior, and perhaps new gameplay features.We may also have a better idea of mission layout, how Lucia and Jason's narratives interact in-game, and whether character-switching or co-op mechanics return. The trailer might also verify side missions, cars, and deepened social media features teased before.If Rockstar adheres to its customary release schedule, a third trailer will likely come in late 2025, conveniently during a holiday or large gaming event.With the tales of Lucia and Jason in the limelight, Rockstar has paved the way for a broader examination of what GTA VI really has to offer. A third trailer that highlights Vice City and gameplay elements seems not only probable, it seems unavoidable.Also Read: 5 things you might have missed in the GTA VI May 6 trailer","Rockstar Games has released two trailers for Grand Theft Auto VI.

The hype of Grand Theft Auto 6 has officially taken a ride into the station. Here, Rockstar Games brought not only the much awaited second trailer for GTA 6 but also the game listed in wishlists in the PlayStation Store, giving a fresh burst of excitement for one of the most high-profile titles ever in gaming.GTA 6 got its own page on the PS Store within hours of trailer drop on May 6, allowing players to add it to their wish lists.

Interestingly, it is currently available only on the PS Store, with Xbox Store listings still to follow. This early available status leads to speculation about Sony being a possible front-runner for the game-marketing blitz.This makes this revelation really special, as all the new trailer footage and official screenshots were recorded on the PS5 base unit; now, it sets the bar for graphical excellence. With speculations of a PS5 Pro coming out towards the end of this year, or probably the start of next year, fans can only await smooth and upgraded visuals when GTA 6 launches.Indeed, there is a rich, interesting open world crafted into a modernized Vice City , with time-stamped lighting and detailed mesmerizing environments; fluid animations hint at the technical potential behind this game. For PlayStation owners, this first glance at the game in its natively running glory on their hardware only serves to heighten anticipation.The game seemed to come into reality as one could now finally view it on the PlayStation Store, and that is what many would say for GTA 6, as one fan put it on an online forum, ""It really happened. Real."" The emotional response further accentuates the long wait the gaming community had for this; it has been more than a decade since the launch of GTA V. Xbox fans will have to hold for a little while before they see the listing within their respective console's store, but the message remains clear: 6 is coming, and it's going to be big.And now with this last move from Rockstar, the gaming world has bulged up under the hype of the much-awaited launch of GTA 6. The wish list is open now, and the date has been fixed, making anticipation mount to new heights.

Is It the Same Phil Cassidy?

Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2

Why It Matters

Nostalgia is back: GTA 6 clearly wants to nod to its roots. Vice City, the neon-soaked city fans still adore, is a huge part of the new map. Bringing back Phil, even in a new form, is Rockstar’s way of saying: “We remember what you loved.” Ammu-Nation will play a bigger role: Having a recognizable “face” for the gun store brand—especially one with Phil’s charisma—means we’ll probably see more story and commercial elements built around Ammu-Nation. Expect more fan-favorite callbacks: If Phil Cassidy made it in, who else might show up next? Kent Paul? Umberto Robina? We’re officially on nostalgia watch.

Rockstar just dropped the second trailer for GTA 6, and while the chaos, cars, and characters all grabbed attention, it’s the blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment atthat’s got long-time fans buzzing. A familiar face from the Vice City era might be back—and he’s armed, iconic, and upgraded. Here's what you should know!If you grew up blasting through missions in, you probably remember Phil Cassidy—the wild, gun-loving, one-armed explosives expert who ran a weapons shop and had a flair for chaos. His loyalty, insane war stories, and love for firepower made him one of the most unforgettable side characters in the franchise.Now, fast forward to GTA 6. At the 2:09 mark of the new trailer, there’s a TV commercial playing inside Jason and Lucia’s apartment. It’s a flashy Ammu-Nation ad—but wait—Or at least, a reimagined version of him.He’s got the same over-the-top energy, American-flag muscle tee, and ""Fully Cocked"" confidence. This time, though, it looks like he’s no longer running a shady backlot gun shack—he’s now the face of Ammu-Nation, GTA’s iconic weapons chain. A full HD makeover, cleaner lines, same explosive charm.Well… not exactly. Rockstar hasn’t confirmed if this is aof the same Phil from Vice City, or simply a rebooted version adapted for the new timeline and setting of Leonida (a fictional Florida-like state).In GTA’s multiverse, characters sometimes reappear across timelines without being the “same person.” Think of this Phil as a spiritual successor—or a modern homage. But his appearance is unmistakably deliberate. Rockstar knew fans would spot it. And they did.This moment tells us three big things:GTA 6 isn’t just a new game—it’s a return to vibes fans have been craving for two decades. And if Phil Cassidy’s cameo is any indication, Rockstar is about to serve up a perfect mix of new chaos and old-school charm.","Phil Cassidy could make a return in GTA 6.

Skill ceiling and learning curve

Community and competitive scene

The debate between Fortnite and Valorant continues to stir strong opinions in the gaming community , especially as both titles evolve in different directions. While one embraces vibrant chaos and creativity, the other relies on precision and tactical coordination. So, which game stands taller in 2025? The answer depends on what kind of player you are.At the core, Fortnite and Valorant offer fundamentally different experiences.Fortnite thrives as a fast-paced battle royale with a unique building mechanic, allowing players to create cover and vantage points on the fly. It caters to players who enjoy high-speed engagements, creative freedom, and unpredictable action.In contrast, Valorant is a tactical 5v5 first-person shooter that rewards communication, map control, and calculated plays. The game places heavy emphasis on character abilities, precise aim, and teamwork. It’s more about who holds angles better than who builds faster.While both games require practice to master, Fortnite arguably has the steeper learning curve. New players often struggle with the complex build mechanics, and seasoned veterans dominate the field with speed and structure. Valorant, meanwhile, has a more accessible entry point, but the path to higher ranks demands refined aim and deep understanding of agent abilities.Some players believe Fortnite is the more “skill-based” game, needing quick reflexes, game sense, and mechanical prowess. Others argue that Valorant offers more depth with its role-based gameplay, encouraging strategic thinking and coordination.Valorant has grown a passionate competitive community, with a clear ranking system, frequent updates, and global tournaments. The game’s esports scene continues to expand, backed by developer Riot Games' support and marketing.Fortnite remains a cultural phenomenon, known for its iconic emotes, frequent crossovers, and younger player base. While its esports presence has waned slightly, it still attracts millions through events and collaborations with celebrities and brands.If you prefer creativity, high-octane battles, and don’t mind chaos, Fortnite is your playground. But if you enjoy clutch moments, team synergy, and methodical gameplay, Valorant offers a more grounded competitive experience.In 2025, there’s no clear winner - only the better fit for your gaming style.","The debate between Fortnite and Valorant continues to stir strong opinions in the gaming community.

The latest trailer of GTA 6 by Rockstar Games is packed with some explosive action, but only eagle-eyed fans might have spotted the insane hidden details in it. The sneaky details reveal the deeper layers of nostalgia, gameplay, and the next-gen immersion. From the throwbacks to the jaw-dropping realism, they all reveal how deep the game can go. Here are the 5 insane details you might have overlooked in the excitement of the new trailer.One blink and you would have missed the moment showing the beer bottles on the bar table, with the actual bubbles rising inside it.The tiny detail, where even the drinks feel authentic, proves that Rockstar Games is not just pushing graphics but is simulating real-world physics down to carbonation. If something such as small as the beer fizz could get so much attention, one can imagine how alive Vice City would be.In the brief scene, Jason's living room reveals the PlayStation 5, but the control looks suspiciously like the PS4. Is this a playful jab at Sony's design or a hint that GTA 6 might let the players revisit the classics like Vice City in the game? For now, we can just speculate it is both the meta Easter egg and the nod to Sony and the gamers ahead of the 2026 launch.Only the sharp-eyed viewers caught the TV ad in the trailer, confirming the GTA: Vice City’s Phil Cassidy. In the storyline, he was the unhinged arms dealer, and this time, in GTA VI, he is running the Ammu-Nation and not the old gun show. His return suggests that the Rockstar Games are weaving the past characters in the world of GTA 6, making players feel much more connected to the history of the series.The wildest scene of the trailer shows the bank vault being dragged by a truck through the streets. It can be a direct nod to the iconic heist of Fast Five. The cinematic flair of Rockstar is on complete display, perfectly blending the Hollywood spectacle with the interactive chaos. If the missions embrace the blockbuster energy, the fans can expect GTA 6 to blur the line between the action movie and the game.Jason, in the trailer, can be seen bench-pressing at the beach. It has sparked rumors that GTA 6 might bring back San Andreas (workouts affected strength and stamina) fitness mechanics. While GTA 5 scrapped the weight management, the new game might borrow the RPG touches, offering improved combat skills to Lucia and more. Either way, it will be cooler for the fans.The details above prove that GTA 6 is not just another sequel. It is a breathing and living world where all the pixels have a purpose. With May 2026 not that far away, one can expect more details of the secrets to surface here.","The latest trailer of GTA 6 by Rockstar Games is packed with some explosive action, but only eagle-eyed fans might have spotted the hidden details.

Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2

What the Trailer Reveals: Action, Style, and Nostalgia

A brand-new pre-launch look into Grand Theft Auto VI detailing story, characters, and locations was given by Rockstar Games . The launch is scheduled for May 26, 2026, on the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S; the fans are getting the most elaborate look ever into what is shaping up to be Rockstar's most ambitious project.GTA 6 is driven by two protagonists with very complex characters: Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos.Jason is a former Army soldier turned low-level drug runner with a murky past and a brooding demeanor. His military training gives him a tactical edge, but life in the underbelly of Vice City 's criminal world has clearly hardened him.Lucia, on the other hand, has just been released from Leonida Penitentiary and hails from Liberty City, where she tried and ultimately failed to defend her family in court. The trailer paints a picture of Lucia as a steady operator with a loyal streak and certainly not one to be taken lightly. Forced together by circumstance, and perhaps by desperation, the pair make an attempt to claw up from the dirt of Leonida's streets.GTA has always introduced the booming side characters, and GTA 6 is no different. In keeping with fans' expectations, the eccentric side characters present an unforgettable aura around them. The principal cast consists of:While the previous installments were set in one particular city, GTA 6 is sprawling across the entire Leonida state, a heavily modern-age Floridian variant. The state is wide and varied, consisting of the following:It appears Rockstar's attempting to blend the chaos through urban streets of GTA V with the raw exotic wilderness of Red Dead Redemption 2. The dynamic environments are simply dripping with detailed sun-lit glamour and gritty decay.This Trailer can be considered a Rockstar show-and-tell of fast cars, wild shootouts, and cinematic storytelling. An iconic moment features a safe heist of the Fast & Furious kind, where an enormously heavy vault is dragged through city streets by a car, utter chaos in GTA tradition.Easter eggs for the audience are all coming back for another round as a nostalgic tribute to the loyalists. The satirical commentary on American culture, social media, and the fine line between fame and crime continues to be woven through the narrative by Rockstar.","GTA 6 trailer 2 revealed more information about Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos.

Final Thoughts

GTA 6 is finally real — and it’s bigger, bolder, and crazier than ever. While the game might not drop until May 2026, Rockstar’s second trailer has pulled back the curtain on its most important feature — the characters. Set in the sun-soaked, chaos-filled Vice City (in the fictional state of Leonida), GTA 6 introduces two leads and a crew of unforgettable side characters who bring the world to life.Here’s a crisp lowdown on every major and side character revealed so far.Lucia grew up learning to fight, a skill her father instilled early. Life’s relentless blows landed her in the Leonida Penitentiary, but luck saw her released. Now, with freedom on her side, Lucia is determined to pursue the good life her mother always dreamed of. She’s smart, calculated, and ready to take on the world — even if it means partnering with Jason, whose unpredictable nature could be either a blessing or a curse.Jason is a man caught between the desire for an easy life and the harsh reality of his past. Raised around criminals, he tried to escape his troubled youth by joining the Army, but his instincts led him back to crime, working for drug runners in the Leonida Keys. Despite his tough exterior, Jason is searching for a way out — and meeting Lucia Caminos could be his ticket. However, whether she’s his salvation or downfall remains uncertain.Cal is Jason’s friend, a conspiracy enthusiast who spends most of his time at home monitoring Coast Guard frequencies and indulging in internet paranoia. Despite his skeptical worldview, Cal remains a loyal companion, albeit one who prefers the sidelines to direct confrontation.A local legend in Vice City, Boobie has managed to turn his street smarts into a legitimate business empire. From real estate to a strip club and a recording studio, his operations are always strategic. Despite his tough business mindset, Boobie’s partnership with Dre’Quan for Only Raw Records shows his passion for the music scene.Dre’Quan always aimed to break into the music industry. Starting as a street hustler, he now runs Only Raw Records, scouting talent and pushing hits. His partnership with Real Dimez could finally cement his place in the Vice City music landscape.This rap duo rose to fame with a viral hit but has since struggled to replicate that success. Now signed to Only Raw Records, they’re looking to reclaim their spot in the Vice City music scene, balancing their edgy image with their musical ambitions.A veteran bank robber with a magnetic personality, Raul knows how to recruit talent for high-stakes heists. His reckless nature keeps his crew on edge, but his knack for adapting makes him a valuable ally — or a risky bet.GTA 6 is shaping up to be a wild mix of high-stakes crime, social media madness, and music scene drama — all wrapped in Rockstar’s signature chaos. Lucia and Jason are the heart of the story, but it’s the side characters that fill Vice City with life, danger, and unpredictable energy. Stay tuned — this crew is just getting started.","GTA 6 is shaping up to be wild mix of crime, social media madness, and music scene drama.
