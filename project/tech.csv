Knee Surgery Meme: Explaining the evolution of 'That feeling when knee surgery is tomorrow' meme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explaining-the-evolution-of-that-feeling-when-knee-surgery-is-tomorrow-meme/articleshow/115139251.cms,"What does the meme mean

What makes the joke intriguing

When did it originate

The ""That feeling when knee surgery is tomorrow"" meme, also known as the Blue Grinch meme , expresses a specific emotional state associated with a pending knee surgery.The meme which gained widespread popularity, traces its origins to an earlier version featuring a squirrel image.The meme finds humor in a highly specific and relatable situation, creating an instant connection for those who have experienced the anxiety of an upcoming medical procedure, specifically knee surgery.The inclusion of the ""Blue Grinch"" character amplifies the sense of nervousness and lack of energy surrounding the experience.The humor lies in its highly specific focus, serving as both a commentary on traditional meme conventions and a departure from them, the Daily Dot reported.The meme focuses on such specific and nuanced situations that its precision itself becomes the punchline, providing a clever commentary on meme culture that is both humorous and insightful.While most memes strive for widespread appeal by tapping into universal emotions, the ""knee surgery"" meme maintains a deliberately narrow scope, which sets it apart.According to Know Your Meme, the first version of this meme was created in 2021 by an anonymous user on MemeCreator.org. It featured an animated squirrel standing upright with its front paws raised, capturing widespread attention when it appeared on the Instagram account stupid.fricken.meme later that year.At present, the ""Blue Grinch knee surgery"" memes remain notably non-political in nature. While it's common for memes that start as neutral to take on political or unexpected directions, this particular format mainly serves as a self-referential commentary on meme culture.(This is a top story on Google Trends)","The meme expresses a specific emotional state associated with a pending knee surgery.

WWE RAW's Netflix Debut Might Be in Trouble Following Mike Tyson vs Jake Paul Fight Controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/wwe-raws-netflix-debut-might-be-in-trouble-following-mike-tyson-vs-jake-paul-fight-controversy/articleshow/115415470.cms,"Image via WWE/Netflix

Why will WWE RAW face trouble at launch?

WWE RAW is set to make a grand debut on Netflix on January 6, 2025. However, the show might be in for a few troubles before it even launches on the platform. The main reason behind this problem is the recently concluded Tyson vs Paul fight which invited a lot of criticism from fans all over the world because of two main issues.With that said, it’s still a big event for WWE, because their Netflix debut will allow them to reach out to a larger audience, further solidifying their position in the world of professional wrestling.Before talking about the issue, let’s get one thing clear. WWE as we know it, does have a script, and more often than not, the rivalries that you see in the ring, are based on a script and don't have anything to do with the wrestlers and their real lives.Sometimes, however, these rivalries do spill out of the rings and into the real lives of the wrestlers, but such situations are rare.With that being said, here are the two main reasons why WWE RAW could face problems with their Netflix launch. Firstly, there are rumors doing the rounds which suggest that the fight between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson was scripted. And for anyone who watched the fight, such a rumor isn’t that difficult to believe. There are also rumors that suggest that Netflix and the promoters of the fight made the script because it would make them more money if they tweaked the outcome of the match to their favor.While WWE itself is scripted to a great extent, if Netflix were to interfere with the process, then there might be a problem if the storyline doesn’t add up with respect to the feuds that are being executed.Secondly, WWE is an extremely popular wrestling entertainment company, and many individuals tune into the matches at a regular basis. While this isn’t really a concern, there are worries that Netflix won’t be able to handle the traffic, considering that their servers were lagging very hard on the day they were streaming the event from ringside. If this is an issues that the company cannot solve, WWE’s numbers might be hurt to a great extent.Although all these are speculations for now, hopefully none of it will come to pass. It will be worth seeing how things pan out once the new show releases on the streaming platform.Also read: Jake Paul Wants to Fight Connor McGregor As Mike Tyson Throws Down the Gauntlet for Logan Paul","WWE RAW is set to make a grand debut on Netflix on January 6, 2025.

Progress or procrastination?

Ah, the Industrial Revolution—a time when humanity collectively decided that hand-crafted goods were for amateurs and that steam power was the future.Let’s take a light-hearted look back at this era of coal dust, steam engines, and the very first instances of ""Are we there yet?"" from factory workers everywhere.Picture it: the late 18th century. People were happily spinning wool by hand, and then—BAM!—a bunch of inventors said, “What if we let machines do that instead?” Enter the spinning jenny, a machine so revolutionary it made the hand-spun wool look like a primitive hobby. If you thought getting a new smartphone was exciting, imagine how thrilled folks were when they first saw a factory machine! (Spoiler: they were not thrilled. More like terrified.)Then came steam power, the caffeine of the Industrial Revolution . Suddenly, everything was powered by steam. Trains, boats, and even that neighbor who kept saying, “I’ll be there in a minute!” were fueled by this new energy source. Steam engines turned out to be so efficient that they could power entire factories—along with a significant amount of Victorian angst as workers were replaced by machines. It was like watching your favorite barista get replaced by a vending machine: efficient, but where's the personality?With the rise of factories came the rise of the nine-to-five workday. Previously, people worked based on the sun’s schedule, but now they were clocking in to make sure that their boss could afford yet another top hat. Imagine the first day at the factory: “Welcome to your new job! Here’s your work station, and by the way, your lunch break is only 15 minutes. Enjoy your day!”Factories were like the fast food joints of the era—efficient, standardized, and with a side of monotony. Workers toiled in conditions that would make even the hardiest souls reconsider their career paths. Think of it as an all-you-can-eat buffet of labor, but with a lot more grime and way fewer dessert options.As factories sprung up, cities grew like weeds in a garden. People flocked to urban areas hoping to escape the drudgery of rural life, only to find themselves living in cramped apartments that resembled shoeboxes with better plumbing. Urban life was a mixed bag: bustling markets, cultural diversity, and the occasional horse-drawn carriage that decided to “unload” right in front of you.Let’s not forget the innovations! The Industrial Revolution was like a tech conference on steroids. The cotton gin, the steam engine, and even the power loom burst onto the scene like flashy new products. Everyone was buzzing about the future, while some folks were still trying to figure out how to operate their newfangled spinning wheels without accidentally knitting a sweater for an elephant.In retrospect, the Industrial Revolution was a mixed bag of progress, invention, and a whole lot of soot. While it laid the groundwork for the modern world, it also raised the question: were we really ready for machines to take over? The answer, clearly, was no. But we dove in headfirst, because who could resist the charm of steam-powered everything?So here’s to the Industrial Revolution: the time when humanity said, “Let’s crank up some machines, forget about fresh air, and see what happens!” We may have gained factories, trains, and a questionable amount of progress, but we also learned that sometimes it’s good to take a break from the machines and just… spin our own wool once in a while.","The Industrial Revolution was like a tech conference on steroids.

The Downfall Of Diddy: Ray J Alleges Celebrities Paying Off Diddy Victims in Shocking Documentary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/celeb-friends-of-sean-diddy-combs-paying-victims-to-stay-quiet-ray-j-makes-startling-claim-in-new-documentary/articleshow/115262207.cms,"Sean Diddy (L) and Ray J

Revelations from Ray J’s Documentary



The Legal Challenges Surrounding Diddy



Paying for Silence: A Disturbing Trend



Ray J’s Role and Diddy’s Birthday in Jail



Ray J has made claims in a new documentary, The Downfall of Diddy : Inside the Freak-Offs, alleging that numerous high-profile celebrities have approached him, expressing concern over their connections with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs. According to Ray J, these individuals are reportedly offering financial settlements to Diddy’s victims in a bid to keep their involvement hidden. Ray J, who has previously spoken about the allegations against Diddy, suggests that some celebrities are working to prevent the release of compromising videos and other potentially damaging information.In a shocking claim, Ray J suggests that several prominent celebrities are paying off individuals connected to Diddy to keep them from speaking out. This accusation arises as Diddy remains in custody at the Metropolitan Detention Centre in Brooklyn, facing charges that include sex trafficking, racketeering, and abuse over an extensive period.In the documentary, Ray J openly discusses his concerns about the lengths some celebrities are reportedly going to in order to keep their connections to Diddy’s alleged activities under wraps. He claims that these individuals are contacting victims directly, offering them financial compensation to avoid public exposure or potential lawsuits. During the interview, Ray J appears visibly uneasy as he describes how some are “cutting off” victims before any demands are made. “Some people are reaching out to victims before they’ve even asked for anything, trying to handle it quietly,” Ray J explains, at one point hesitating before saying, ""I think I’ve said too much.""Since his September arrest, Sean Combs has faced a series of serious charges, including allegations of orchestrating gatherings for sexual exploitation. His ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, was one of the first to bring forward allegations of years of abuse.Reports indicate that over 120 individuals are now making claims against Diddy, with some of these reportedly being settled privately. Attorney Tony Buzbee, appearing in the documentary, states, “We have resolved some matters privately, in the best interest of the victims.”Ray J’s claims highlight a troubling trend where money is allegedly used to silence potential victims and suppress allegations. According to him, celebrities connected to Diddy are paying off victims to keep their names out of the press and to avoid any negative fallout from their association. “It happens all the time. People pay off victims to keep the truth quiet,” Ray J asserts, likening it to the “catch and kill” practice in media, where stories are suppressed to prevent them from going public.In the documentary, Ray J claims that some fear videos could surface, allegedly featuring Diddy in compromising situations with other celebrities. “They fear the worst – that those videos could ruin them,” Ray J adds, expressing concern over the secrecy and control exercised in these situations.Attorney Buzbee warns that anyone involved in covering up such activities could face legal repercussions. “If you were present, if you saw something and did nothing, you too are liable,” Buzbee cautions, adding that many of these individuals risk exposure if the full truth emerges.Ray J’s involvement in the documentary has raised questions about the extent to which some will go to protect their reputations and distance themselves from Diddy’s alleged actions. He suggests that certain individuals are trying to erase any trace of their connection to Diddy, fearing the impact on their careers and public image.Amid these mounting legal issues, Diddy spent his 55th birthday on 5 November behind bars. In a phone call with his seven children, he expressed his love and gratitude for their support, saying, “I love y’all so much, and I can’t wait to see you.” Despite the serious charges he faces, Diddy’s family remains by his side, a sentiment he continues to convey.Although Ray J has been vocal on the matter, he admits his involvement has not come without conflict. He mentions that his comments have strained relationships with Diddy’s family, leading to heated exchanges. “I said some things that were out of bounds, and I wasn’t proud of myself,” he admits, acknowledging that his forthright stance has caused friction. “But I felt like I needed to stand up for myself.”As this case develops, the focus remains on Diddy, his legal battles, and the powerful figures allegedly working to distance themselves from the scandal. The full documentary, The Downfall of Diddy: Inside the Freak-Offs, is available to watch on Tubi for those interested in further details of this unfolding story.","Ray J has made claims in a new documentary, The Downfall of Diddy : Inside the Freak-Offs.

What causes polar night?



Utqiagvik town in Alaska would only see a sunrise when Donald Trump will take over as the US president. As much as it might sound figurative in nature, it's literally the case as the town enters polar night and sun wouldn't rise above the horizon for 64 days!Nearly 5,000 residents of Utqiagvik, previously known as Barrow, would witness their last sunrise on November 18.Located on Alaska's North Slope along the Arctic Ocean, it lies at a latitude of 71.17 degrees North, roughly 330 miles above the Arctic Circle. This extreme location means that for about two months each year, the sun remains below the horizon, resulting in an extended polar night, the Washington Post reported.The polar night happens because of the Earth's tilt on its axis, which is about 23.5 degrees. Because of this tilt, some places on Earth, like the Arctic Circle (the very top of the world), get either no sunlight or all the sunlight for a long time during the year.When the Arctic Circle is tilted away from the sun, it stays dark for a long time, and that’s called the polar night. But when it’s tilted toward the sun, it stays sunny even at night—that’s called the midnight sun .","Nearly 5,000 residents of Utqiagvik, previously known as Barrow, would witness their last sunrise on November 18.

"Thomas E Kurtz, a creator of BASIC computer language, dies at 96",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/thomas-e-kurtz-a-creator-of-basic-computer-language-dies-at-96/articleshow/115398534.cms,"Thomas E Kurtz , a pioneering mathematician at Dartmouth College and an inventor of the simplified computer programming language known as BASIC, which allowed students to easily operate early computers and eventually propelled generations into the world of personal computing , died Tuesday in Lebanon, New Hampshire. He was 96.The cause of his death, in a hospice, was multiple organ failure from sepsis, said Agnes Kurtz, his wife.In the early 1960s, before the days of laptops and smartphones, a computer was the size of a small car and an institution like Dartmouth, where Kurtz taught, had just one. Programming one was the province of scientists and mathematicians and specialists. Kurtz and John G Kemeny , then the chair of Dartmouth's maths department, believed that students would increasingly come to depend on computers and would benefit from understanding how to use them. ""We had the crazy idea that our students, our undergraduate students who are not going to be technically employed later on, social sciences and humanities students, should learn how to use the computer,"" Kurtz said in an interview in 2014. ""Completely nutty idea.""The two mathematicians created the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System, which allowed multiple users to share the processing power of a single computer simultaneously.But the architecture of a system for sharing resources was not enough. Kurtz and Kemeny also wanted to give students an easier platform for understanding how the computers worked and functioned, and to allow them to code and run their own programs. ""I think we could design a completely different way of using computers that would make it possible to give computer instruction to hundreds of students,"" Kemeny recalled Kurtz saying.Kemeny worked with Kurtz and undergraduate students to develop a novice-friendly and intuitive computer language called BASIC (the name was an acronym for Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code). It was a high-level programming language designed for ease of use, which could be used with the time-sharing system. The language was simple. Typing the command ""RUN"" would start a program. ""PRINT"" printed a word or string of letters. ""STOP"" told program to stop.At 4am on May 1, 1964, in the basement of College Hall on the Dartmouth campus, the time-sharing system and BASIC were put to a test. A professor and a student programmer typed a simple command - ""RUN"" - into neighboring Teletype terminals and watched as both received the same answer simultaneously. It worked.BASIC became the language of choice for students learning programming around the globe. The ability to access a computer and have it process data from multiple users at a single time was revolutionary. Allowing those same computer users to easily write their own programs was even bolder.BASIC would provide the intellectual building blocks for later software and is still a fundamental tool in teaching computer programming. One student who later benefited from BASIC was Bill Gates, who used a variation of it as the foundation for the first Microsoft operating systems. Versions of BASIC still power computer operating systems today.","Thomas E Kurtz, a pioneering mathematician at Dartmouth College, died Tuesday. Kurtz was the inventor of the simplified computer programming language known as BASIC. He was 96. The cause of his death, in a hospice, was multiple organ failure from sepsis, his wife said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115398576,imgsize-562442,width-400,resizemode-4/115398576.jpg"

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt characterised Apple co-founder Steve Jobs as a ""diva"" who would bully people but whose difficult personality was outweighed by his brilliance and drive for perfection.Speaking on ""The Diary of A CEO"" podcast, Schmidt praised Jobs' leadership style despite its controversial aspects. ""Opinionated and strong and argumentative and would bully people if he didn't like them, but was brilliant,"" Schmidt said of Jobs. ""He wanted perfection, right? Aligning yourself with Steve Jobs is a good idea.""Schmidt, who led Google from 2001 to 2011, argued that such challenging personalities are essential for corporate innovation. ""If you don't have such a person, your company's not going to go anywhere,"" he said, explaining that companies need someone to push beyond conventional approaches.In their book ""How Google Works,"" Schmidt and former Google VP Jonathan Rosenberg distinguish between beneficial ""divas"" like Jobs and destructive ""knaves."" While both may display difficult personalities, divas contribute to team success despite their eccentricities, whereas knaves prioritise personal gain at others' expense.""Great people are often unusual and difficult,"" they wrote, noting that some of these quirks can be ""quite off-putting."" However, Schmidt emphasised that finding and collaborating with exceptional individuals is crucial for business success, even if they're challenging to work with.Schmidt advised leaders to ""find someone who's just smarter than you, more clever than you, moves faster than you, changes the world... And ally yourself with them because they're the people who are going to make the world different.""Jobs' has been known for his controversial management style , which, despite its harsh aspects, helped drive Apple's numerous successful product launches.","Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt characterised Steve Jobs as a ""diva"" who would bully people.
