"In a 1st in world, Army set to deploy ramjet-powered shells for 155mm artillery guns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-a-1st-in-world-army-set-to-deploy-ramjet-powered-shells-for-155mm-artillery-guns/articleshow/126330397.cms,"From Missiles To Torpedoes, DRDO Outlines India’s Big Defence Push For Near-Term Battlefield Edge

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army is on the cusp of becoming the world’s first armed force to operationally deploy ramjet-powered artillery shells for its 155 mm guns. The advanced technology, developed in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras and with support of Army Technology Board (ATB), is now under trial.Ramjet propulsion is not new and has been used in missiles worldwide. However, applying the technology to artillery shells is a revolutionary step.Professors P A Ramakrishna and S Verma from IIT Madras' Department of Aerospace Engineering co-developed a ramjet-powered artillery shell after years of research. The technology, developed under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, is designed to significantly extend the reach of standard tube artillery.Prof Ramakrishna recently explained that a ramjet operates as an air-breathing engine that does not require turbines or compressors. It relies on the shell being launched to speeds of approx Mach 2 using an artillery gun. At this velocity, air entering the engine is naturally compressed, fuel is ignited and thrust is produced, which allows the shell to maintain propulsion and significantly extend its range.“Being an air-breathing engine, ramjet has higher specific impulse (ISP) (> 4000 N s/kg) compared to that of a solid rocket (~2500 N s/kg) and, therefore, provides much higher overall impulse to the shell for the same mass of propellant,” the IIT-M research paper said.One of the key challenges IIT-M team faced was using ramjet to have high combustion efficiency with restricted secondary combustor length. However, the team managed to overcome this obstacle.The technology promises to extend the range of conventional artillery shells by 30% to 50% while maintaining their destructive power. By integrating ramjet technology into 155 mm shells, the Army obtained the ability to strike deeper targets with greater effectiveness. Developmental trials are currently under way, with successful tests already conducted at the Pokhran field firing ranges. These trials have demonstrated the feasibility of retrofitting ramjet modules onto existing 155 mm shells, meaning the technology can be applied across the Army’s current inventory without requiring entirely new ammunition designs.Once the ramjet artillery shell technology is ready for induction, it can be used in any of the Army’s artillery systems, including on the US-imported M777 ultra-light howitzer.","The Indian Army is on the cusp of becoming the world’s first armed force to operationally deploy ramjet-powered artillery shells for its 155 mm guns.

Red Fort blast: Probe unveils how terrorists spoke to Pakistani handlers - What's a 'ghost' SIM card?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/red-fort-blast-probe-unveils-how-terrorists-spoke-to-pakistani-handlers-whats-a-ghost-sim-card/articleshow/126333192.cms,"Representative image

Massive Car Explosion Near Delhi’s Red Fort Hours After Faridabad Terror Plot bust, Many Dead

The ‘dual-phone’ playbook

A disturbing trend

How does the government plan to tackle this?

The

white-collar terror module

NEW DELHI: Investigations into the blast near Delhi’s Red Fort on November 10 last year have revealed how a ""white-collar"" terror module relied on a sophisticated network of “ghost” SIM cards and encrypted messaging apps to stay in touch with Pakistani handlers.The accused, many of them highly educated doctors, used illegally obtained or fraudulently issued SIM cards and multiple mobile devices to evade surveillance.The findings of this probe subsequently became the basis for a sweeping directive issued by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) on November 28, mandating that app-based communication services such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal must remain continuously linked to an active physical SIM card installed in the device.A “ghost” SIM card is a mobile connection that is illegally issued or fraudulently activated without being linked to the actual user, security officials said. Such SIMs are typically obtained using forged or misused identity documents, including Aadhaar details of unsuspecting civilians, or through bulk activations that bypass verification norms.Investigators say these numbers allow criminals and terror operatives to communicate and use encrypted messaging applications while remaining largely untraceable, posing a significant challenge to telecom surveillance and law enforcement agencies.Officials said the probe uncovered a tactical ""dual-phone"" protocol followed by the module.Each accused carried two to three mobile phones. One ""clean"" handset, registered in their own name, was used for routine personal and professional communication to avoid suspicion. The second, described as a “terror phone”, was used exclusively for encrypted communication with handlers in Pakistan through WhatsApp and Telegram, officials said.The SIM cards used in these secondary devices were issued in the names of unsuspecting civilians whose Aadhaar details had been misused, the officials told news agency PTI. In a parallel development, Jammu and Kashmir Police also uncovered a separate racket in which SIM cards were issued using fake Aadhaar cards.Among those arrested were Muzammil Ganaie and Adeel Rather, while Dr Umar-un-Nabi, another key accused, was killed while driving an explosives-laden vehicle near the Red Fort, officials said. The Pakistani handlers were identified by the codenames ‘Ukasa’, ‘Faizan’ and ‘Hashmi’.Investigators said security agencies noted a disturbing trend in which these compromised SIMs remained active on messaging platforms even when the devices were being operated from Pakistan-occupied Jammu & Kashmir (PoJK) or Pakistan. By exploiting app features that allow continued access without a physical SIM inside the device, handlers were able to remotely guide the module.Officials said the operatives were directed to learn improvised explosive device (IED) assembly through online videos and plan “hinterland” attacks, even though some of the recruits initially wanted to join conflict zones in Syria or Afghanistan.To plug these vulnerabilities, the Centre invoked the Telecommunications Act, 2023, along with the Telecom Cyber Security Rules, to “safeguard the integrity of the telecom ecosystem”. Under the new framework, all Telecommunication Identifier User Entities (TIUEs) have been given 90 days to ensure their applications function only when an active SIM card is present in the device.The order also directs telecom operators to automatically log users out of platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal if no active SIM is detected. Messaging and social media platforms, including Snapchat, Sharechat and Jiochat, have been asked to submit compliance reports to the DoT.“This feature of using apps without a SIM is posing a challenge to telecom cyber security as it is being misused from outside the country to commit cyber frauds and terror activities,” the DoT had said while explaining the rationale behind the move.The directive is being fast-tracked in the Jammu and Kashmir telecom circle. While officials acknowledge that deactivating all expired or fraudulent SIMs will take time, the move is being viewed as a significant blow to the digital infrastructure used by terror networks to radicalise and manage “white-collar” operatives.Failure to comply with the new norms will attract stringent action under the Telecom Cyber Security Rules and other applicable laws, officials said.The “white-collar” terror module began to unravel on the intervening night of October 18-19, 2025, when posters of the banned Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) appeared on walls outside Srinagar city, warning of attacks on police and security forces in the Valley.Treating the development as a serious threat, Senior Superintendent of Police, Srinagar, GV Sundeep Chakravarthy constituted multiple teams to carry out an in-depth investigation. Based on the statements of the arrested accused, the probe led police to Al Falah University in Haryana’s Faridabad, where two doctors, Ganaie, a resident of Koil in south Kashmir’s Pulwama, and Shaheen Sayeed from Lucknow, were arrested.A large cache of arms and ammunition, including 2,900 kg of ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate and sulphur, was seized during the operation, officials said.The car explosion near the Red Fort, which claimed 15 lives, is being investigated by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).","Officials said the probe uncovered a tactical ""dual-phone"" protocol followed by the module.

A new campaign leader emerges as Mercer redefines his role behind the scenes

The Real Matt Mercer (feat. Matt Mercer)





Popular gaming voice actor Matthew Mercer has long been the face and guiding voice behind Critical Role’s iconic “Dungeons and Dragons” livestream. However, his decision to step away from overseeing the flagship livestream shocked many fans. For more than a decade, his creative brand of storytelling as the Dungeon Master helped turn a group of voice actors into one of the most influential brands in modern nerd culture.Mercer opened up further about his decision during an August appearance on the podcast “Crispy’s Tavern: Tales and Tea.” He described the move as something that he needed to do after years of constant creative output, leadership, and visibility. He acknowledged that the pace had begun to affect his well-being, and the need to continuously churn out content was physically draining.He also emphasized the importance of stepping away when one experiences creative burnout, telling Business Insider, “My biggest advice for burnout is to acknowledge when you’re at the edge and take every opportunity you can to step away and replenish your cup.” However, he remains deeply involved alongside his seven co-founders as the Critical Role Productions’ Chief Creative Officer.The company continued to expand its presence through two animated series backed by Amazon. He also plays a key role at Darrington Press, the studio’s game publishing arm, which launched “Daggerheart,” a tabletop game designed as a fresh alternative to traditional “Dungeons and Dragons.Mercer believes that stepping away will only increase his creativity and make time for other things he wants to do. He said, “Walking away and taking some time to enrich your creative input means that whatever time you lost beating your head against the wall will be more than made up for when you return from a place of genuine inspiration and renewal.”To guide the livestream forward, Brennan Lee Mulligan has taken over as game master for Campaign Four. Known for his work on “Dimension 20” and his long-standing creative partnership with Mercer, Mulligan brings a different energy while maintaining the collaborative spirit fans expect. Campaign Four continues to stream on Beacon, as well as Twitch and YouTube. Most recently, Mercer voiced the character Shroud, who served as the main supervillain of the acclaimed video game Dispatch.Also read: Top 10 Twitch streamers by hours watched and Kai Cenat leads the way",Matthew Mercer has stepped away from overseeing Critical Role’s “Dungeons and Dragons’ livestream.

American billionaire and Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban has revealed that he avoids phone calls altogether. As reported by Fortune, in a TikTok video posted by Masterclass, Cuban said, “No, I don’t do calls. You know, I’ll engage with you via email, and trust me, I do this all the time. I’m really good at it.” He further explained that emails enable him to craft a more thoughtful responses and also helps him in preventing from forgetting details midst his bust schedule. “I’ll give you more comprehensive responses than if it was via phone,” he noted, adding that emails also provide a searchable record of conversations.Cuban’s stance echoes a broader generational trend. Many Gen Zers prefer email or text over calls, but for different reasons. A 2024 study found nearly a quarter of the generation avoids answering phone calls entirely, often due to telephobia — a form of phone anxiety that can trigger physical symptoms such as nausea, shaking, and difficulty concentrating.Talking to Business Insider, Billionaire Mark Cuban revealed that his daily routine is not at all exciting rather it’s quite boring. “I read and respond to emails,"" he wrote in an email.""I work out. I read and respond to emails. I do a couple Zooms. Then I read and respond to emails. Then I eat dinner. Then I read and respond to emails,” Cuban told BI.He revealed that his day starts with a decaf coffee and a cookie. He then takes her daughter to school and after that he works out at Life Time Fitness. Once done with the fitness regimen he again dives into his inbox. Despite his wealth, Cuban refuses to hire an assistant to manage his email, saying it would only “slow things down.”“I receive around 700 emails a day and use three phones (two Android and one iPhone) to manage everything. I'd rather get 700 to 1,000 emails than sit in long, boring meetings,” Cuban told BI.He emphasised that emails work for him because they come with searchable history. He also use Gmail’s auto-replies for 10–20% of messages. Cuban also mentioned that that in order to stay focused he keeps the unread emails under 20.Cuban rarely disconnects from email—even on vacation. “It’s faster to just get it out of the way,” he said. Only family events or emergencies prompt him to step away from his inbox for more than a few hours.While some may find his routine monotonous, Cuban sees it as a strategic advantage.","Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban has revealed that he avoids phone calls altogether.

Apple may skip iPhone 18 launch in 2026: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-may-skip-iphone-18-launch-in-2026-report/articleshow/126298730.cms,"Apple's Foldable iPhone is Coming, Here’s Why it Matters

Why iPhone 18 may not launch in 2026





Apple iPhone 18 standard model may not launch this year, says a new report by MacRumours. Other models under the iPhone 18 series – iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max are likely to have the usual launch timeline and are expected to come in September 2026. As per the report, the Cupertino-based company may unveil its first foldable ‌iPhone‌ during the fall event.“For more than a decade, Apple has introduced its mainline ‌iPhone‌ lineup in the fall, with all core models launching simultaneously in September,” MacRumors reported. “That pattern is expected to change this year, when the company is widely rumored to split its upcoming ‌iPhone‌ releases across two distinct release windows rather than unveiling the entire lineup at once. Under this strategy, Apple is expected to prioritize higher-end models in the fall while delaying lower-cost or standard models until the following year,” the report says.According to the report, iPhone 18 may not arrive until the spring of 2027, leaving the ‌iPhone 17‌ “as the latest standard model for over 18 months.” To recall, iPhone 17 debuted in September 2025 along with other iPhone 17 series models. “This would mark the first time Apple skips an entire calendar year without releasing a new generation of its flagship non-Pro ‌iPhone‌,” it says.MacRumours says that the rumoured change is likely due to Apple’s expanding iPhone lineup. Apple introduced iPhone 16e and iPhone Air last year. The company is rumoured to bring its first foldable iPhone in 2026. With the continued presence of iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, there could be at least eight iPhone models on sale by the end of 2026 (considering Apple’s next iPhone lineup continues to include – iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max and iPhone 18).“A staggered release schedule would allow the company to further differentiate its models, give them a longer sales window without internal competition, and spread ‌iPhone‌ launches more evenly across the year,” the report says.According to supply chain analysts, the rumoured shift will also result in manufacturing and logistics benefits for the iPhone maker. “By spacing out launches, Apple could reduce production bottlenecks, better manage component supply for advanced technologies, and smooth revenue recognition across fiscal quarters rather than concentrating ‌iPhone‌ sales in a single period,” the report adds.","Apple iPhone 18 standard model may not launch this year, says a new report by MacRumours. Other models under the iPhone 18 series – iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone18 Pro Max are likely to have the usual launch timeline and are expected to come in September 2026. As per the report, the Cupertino-based company may unveil its first foldable iPhone during the fall event.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126298729,imgsize-32448,width-400,resizemode-4/iphone-17.jpg"
Meta AI chief Alexandr Wang says will have kids only after Elon Musk’s Neuralink …,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-ai-chief-alexandr-wang-says-will-have-kids-only-after-elon-musks-neuralink-/articleshow/126263932.cms,"Here’s what Alexandr Wang said about Elon Musk's Neuralink

“Billionaire Alexandr Wang says he wants to wait to have kids until Neuralink is very advanced, because children’s brains in the first seven years are more flexible and can learn brain-computer interfaces, unlocking more potential than adult brains

Speaking on a podcast, Wang explained that he wants to wait until Neuralink or similar BCI technology is reliable and widely available. His reasoning is that children born into such a world could integrate the technology directly into their developing brains, rather than having to adapt to it later in life

He pointed to neuroplasticity, the brain’s heightened ability to form neural connections in early childhood, arguing that during the first ~7 years, children could learn to use brain-computer interfaces in ways adults simply cannot.

""I think with plasticity, you're talking, in general, you're talking about the entire brain. You're talking about altering a trillion synapses all in a similar way,"" he said.

At a deeper level, Wang’s comments reflect a broader concern: artificial intelligence is advancing at an exponential pace, while human biological evolution is slow. He suggests that direct neural links to AI may eventually be necessary for humans to remain cognitively competitive in a future shaped by superintelligence.”

Meta’s Superintelligence Lab is hiring in Singapore

Read Meta chief AI Alexandr Wang's full memo to employees

“It's never an easy decision to say goodbye to colleagues. These are talented people who have worked extremely hard and contributed to our Al effort. Anyone in North America whose role was impacted has already been notified. Those who may be impacted in EMEA have been notified and remain subject to consultation,” Wang said.

“This by no means signals any decrease in investment. In fact, we will continue to hire industry-leading Al-native talent. Our goal is to enable MSL to move faster. We remain excited about the models we are training, our ambitious compute plans, and the products we are building, and I'm confident in our path to superintelligence,” he added.





Alexandr Wang, the head of Meta’s artificial intelligence division — SuperIntelligence Labs has now given a new statement on his plans of having kids. Speaking at The Shawn Rayan Show, Wang said that he wait until Elon Musk ’s Neuralink or similar brain‑computer interface (BCI) technology is highly advanced before having children. Wang is of the opinion that child neuroplasticity offers the best window for adopting brain‑computer interfaces, and that future generations could grow up learning to use superintelligence tools intuitively. “I’ll have kids after Neuralink is very advanced, because children’s brains in the first seven years are more flexible and can learn brain-computer interfaces, unlocking more potential than adult brains,” said Wang.Tesla CEO Elon Musk founded Neuralink is presently conducting clinical trials and is working at restoring mobility for patients with paralysis. Musk has long promoted the idea of expanding the technology to enhance human cognition. Wang’s remarks highlight how some tech leaders see BCIs not just as medical tools, but as essential upgrades for future generations.Meta Superintelligence Lab (MSL), the billion-dollar team that Mark Zuckerberg created to take on Google and OpenAI in artificial intelligence (AI), is hiring. Alexandr Wang, the head of the team and Chief AI officer of Meta, has announced that the company is hiring for its team in Singapore. This comes hours after the social media giant acquired Manus AI, a Singapore-based company working on AI agents.“MSL is hiring in Singapore! We already have some amazing researchers and engineers there, buoyed now by the 100-strong Manus team, and we’re growing fast,” Wang said in a post on X (formerly Twitter). “Feel free to DM with a resumé if interested!,” he added.In the memo, Alexandr Wang wrote:","Alexandr Wang, the head of Meta’s artificial intelligence division — SuperIntelligence Labs has now given a new statement on his plans of having kids.

Ten tech trends to watch in 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ten-tech-trends-to-watch-in-2026/articleshow/126344580.cms,"After years of AI hype, 2026 brings a reality check. Companies need to prove their billion-dollar bets are worth it. Data centres are spreading globally, straining power grids. AI agents are moving from pilots to production. Robots are getting smarter. New hardware forms are arriving. Meanwhile, tech billionaires keep getting richer. The gap between hype and deployment is shrinking fast, and 2026 could turn out to be a real pivoting year.

AI shifts from hype to payback

Data centres spread across the globe

Work gets reimagined

Hardware gets weird new forms

Computing gets smarter, not just bigger

New models go beyond text

Robots become real(er)

The startup birth rate soars

Tech billionaires get even richer

What the 2026 really looks like





After years of AI hype and billion-dollar bets, 2026 is shaping up to be a reality check for the tech industry. Companies that dumped money into generative AI tools now face a simple question: show us the value, or shut it down.The pace of change isn't slowing. If anything, it's getting faster. Tools that seemed cutting-edge six months ago already feel outdated. Companies are racing to stay ahead, while also trying to prove their investments weren't wasted.Here are the ten trends in technology to watch out for in 2026.The experimental phase is over. Enterprises spent 2024 and 2025 testing AI pilots and proof-of-concept projects. Now they want measurable returns on those investments.""2026 is the 'show me the money' year for AI,"" says Venky Ganesan, a partner at Menlo Ventures. Companies will demand hard ROI numbers. Those that can't deliver value will see their software renewals drop and their fundraising dry up.This pressure will split the market. Some AI companies will thrive by solving specific problems well. Others will struggle or fail entirely. Ganesan predicts at least one major AI company will face severe financial trouble or bankruptcy in 2026.The flip side: successful companies could go public. Both OpenAI and SpaceX are eyeing IPOs at valuations near $1 trillion. If these launches succeed, they'll create a wave of new wealth and validate AI's business potential.You heard a lot about data centres in 2025. Get ready to hear more in 2026.The infrastructure boom that started in the US and China is going global. India is attracting massive investment from tech giants. Microsoft committed $17.5 billion to new data centres there. Before Microsoft's CEO left the stage at that announcement, Amazon declared it would spend $35 billion on its own facilities. Google and Meta quickly followed with their own multi-billion dollar plans.Southeast Asia is seeing double-digit growth in data centre capacity. Brazil wants to become Latin America's hub. Saudi Arabia and the UAE struck $600 billion in AI deals with the US, including plans for the largest AI campus outside America.This expansion creates real problems. These facilities consume enormous amounts of electricity and water. In hot regions, cooling requirements push consumption even higher. Brazil has already seen blackouts tied to data centre demand. Local communities often can't find out how much power and water a facility will use, thanks to legal secrecy.China offers a warning: just because you build it doesn't mean they'll come. The country rushed to construct about 150 new data centres in 2024. Now up to 80% of that new computing capacity sits unused, struggling to find customers.AI hasn't replaced most workers yet. Even though it has impacted a big number of workers, changing how work gets done in particular niches.Coding looks completely different than it did five years ago. Developers use AI assistants that can generate, debug, and refactor code. The technology has matured enough that these tools genuinely save time. Customer service is being handed over to chatbots, despite customer frustration.AI agents were the buzzword of 2025, but most stayed in pilot programs. Only 11% of organisations actually deployed them in production, despite 38% running tests. The gap between pilot and production tells the real story. Many companies automated broken processes instead of redesigning their operations from scratch. That approach rarely works.In 2026, agents will become more capable and trustworthy. They'll handle complex, multi-step tasks without constant human oversight. Think booking entire trips, negotiating better service rates, or managing workflows across different systems. ""A year from now, answering questions will be the least useful thing AI can do,"" says Fidji Simo, OpenAI's CEO of applications. ""We'll have proactive AI assistants constantly running in the background, getting things done for us. ""But there's a catch. Many companies will spin out hundreds of agents per employee, only to see most sit idle. Without proper integration into existing workflows, these agents become expensive shelfware. The winners will be companies that connect agents to deterministic systems and give them clear, focused tasks.The smartphone has looked basically the same for a decade: a big black screen with some buttons on the side. That's changing.Apple is rumoured to release a folding phone in 2026. Android devices have already gone this route, even including some phones that fold twice. But Apple's loyal customer base could make folding screens mainstream.Then, a lot of others are also racing to build the first successful AI hardware device. OpenAI invested $6.5 billion in Jony Ive's startup, which is working on a physical AI product. The Humane pin and Friend necklace both made noise but never caught on. Humane has already shut down.Smart glasses present the most promising direction. They're already popular, and Meta dominates the space. In 2026, expect these devices to get smarter and more common. They offer a natural way to interact with AI without pulling out your phone.You'll also see AI show up in places you didn't ask for it. Samsung already added its Bixby assistant to refrigerators back in 2024. Hotels might offer smart duvets. Your rental car might have an AI assistant. Not all of this will be useful or wanted.The AI infrastructure race is shifting from raw scale to efficiency. You can't keep throwing more computing power at every problem.""2026 will be the year of frontier versus efficient model classes,"" says Kaoutar El Maghraoui, a principal research scientist at IBM. Next to huge models with billions of parameters, you'll see efficient, hardware-aware models running on modest accelerators.The hardware race won't only be about GPUs anymore. ASICs, chiplet designs, analogue inference, and quantum-assisted optimisers will all mature. A new class of chips designed specifically for running AI agents could emerge.Think of it like air traffic control for AI workloads. Computing power will be packed more densely and routed dynamically. If one job slows, another moves in instantly. Nothing sits idle. This makes infrastructure smarter, more sustainable, and more adaptable.Quantum computing is also reaching an inflection point. Microsoft, Google, and others believe quantum machines will start tackling problems that classical computers can't handle. Hybrid systems that combine quantum, AI, and supercomputers could drive breakthroughs in materials science, drug development, and climate modelling.Large language models dominated AI development for the past few years. They predict the next word in a sequence. In 2026, a different approach could take centre stage: world models.World models work by learning from videos, simulations, and spatial inputs. Instead of predicting the next word, they predict what happens next in the physical world. They model how things move over time.This matters for robotics, video games, and any application where AI needs to understand cause and effect without being explicitly programmed. World models can grasp concepts like gravity or momentum just by watching.Google, Meta, and Chinese companies like Tencent are all developing world models. Yann LeCun, one of AI's pioneers, left Meta to launch a world model startup. Fei-Fei Li's company World Labs released its first model in 2025.At the same time, Europe is moving in a different direction: small language models. These are lightweight versions of LLMs designed to run on smartphones or low-powered computers. They use fewer parameters and consume less energy, but they can still handle text generation, translation, and question-answering.Small models make economic sense amid talk of the AI bubble bursting. They cost less to build, less to run, and don't require massive data centres. European governments are increasingly wary of depending on American AI infrastructure, which could accelerate investment in smaller, more sustainable models.AI security becomes mission-criticalAI creates a cybersecurity paradox: the same capabilities driving business innovation are also introducing new risks. In 2026, organisations will face mounting pressure to secure AI systems while defending against AI-powered attacks.The threats are multiplying fast. Shadow AI deployments bypass security controls. Adversarial attacks manipulate models into producing wrong outputs. AI agents operating with broad system access create new attack surfaces. ""Every agent should have similar security protections as humans,"" says Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president of Microsoft Security.Even OpenAI is sounding the alarm. CEO Sam Altman recently acknowledged that AI models are ""starting to present some real challenges,"" including models that are ""so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities."" The company is actively hiring a new Head of Preparedness to study emerging AI-related risks, from cybersecurity threats to mental health impacts. The role comes with a $555,000 salary, reflecting how seriously the company takes these challenges.Companies will need to secure four domains: data, models, applications, and infrastructure. Defenders are fighting back with AI agents for red teaming, adversarial training, and automated threat detection at machine speed.Robots are nothing like what they used to be. From pre-programmed machines, they are evolving into adaptive systems capable of perception, learning, and autonomous operation. Physical AI is breaking out of warehouses and into mainstream use.Amazon has already deployed its millionth robot, and if the company is to be believed, AI coordinates entire fleets, and that’s helping them save travel time by about 10%. At BMW plants, cars now drive themselves along production routes. The real magic, however, is when world models combine with robotics, allowing systems to comprehend their surroundings and adapt to surprises.The next frontier is humanoid robots that can navigate spaces designed for humans, as companies race to craft machines capable of doing just that. The potential stretches across manufacturing, healthcare, and disaster response, and is increasingly accessible beyond the early adopters as costs fall.AI coding tools are making it easier than ever to build software. The result: a wave of new startups hitting the market in 2026.Tools like Replit, Cursor, and Loveable let people build products without engineering backgrounds. You can go from idea to working software faster than ever before. Building AI agents is also getting simpler. Business users can create them without touching code.Not every startup will make it. Markets will get crowded. Competition will heat up. But the sheer number of new companies will reshape the landscape and push established players to move faster.Tech's wealthiest executives are about to get a lot wealthier. Ten top earners added $550 billion to their fortunes in 2025. The trend isn't slowing down.Two massive IPOs are coming: OpenAI and SpaceX, both valued near $1 trillion. SpaceX's debut will add tens of billions to Elon Musk's net worth, which already sits around $600 billion. He's also eligible for two Tesla pay packages worth a combined $1.056 trillion. Sam Altman stands to benefit from OpenAI's listing, along with major backers like Microsoft. Jeff Bezos Mark Zuckerberg , and Satya Nadella have all seen their wealth climb as AI investments pay off.Larry Ellison might be the exception. Oracle's stock dropped hard as investors questioned AI spending, erasing $80 billion in market value.Every trend in tech seems to point in one direction: more wealth flowing upward. The AI boom, the data centre buildout, the chip shortage, the agent revolution—all of it concentrates power and money in fewer hands. A handful of tech executives now wield enormous influence over technology that affects everyone's daily life.Every trend here points to the same reality: the distance between hype and deployment is collapsing. Tech used to take years to move from labs to living rooms. Now it takes months, sometimes weeks.This creates winners and losers fast. Companies that can't prove AI's value will fold. Workers in certain fields will find their jobs radically different or gone entirely. Cities welcoming data centres might face power shortages they didn't plan for. Meanwhile, a small group of tech billionaires keeps getting richer off all of it, concentrating more control over systems that affect billions of people.The pace isn't slowing down. If anything, 2026 will be the year when that becomes impossible to ignore.","After years of AI hype, 2026 brings a reality check. Companies need to prove their billion-dollar bets are worth it.

Q: Why is career cushioning important?

Q: How can I start career cushioning?

Q: What are some examples of career cushioning?

Q: Is career cushioning only for people in certain industries?

Q: How often should I review and update my career cushioning efforts?

Q: How do I know if my career cushioning efforts are working?

Q: How much time should I be dedicating to career cushioning?

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

"Did Starmer impose a curfew in the UK? No, it's just a fake TikTok video",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/did-starmer-impose-a-curfew-in-the-uk-no-its-just-a-fake-tiktok-video/articleshow/126262276.cms,"Keir Starmer

Coup In Britain? Starmer’s ‘Own Cabinet Plots’ His Downfall | ‘Full Bunker Mode’ In No. 10





The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true. ""The UK is set to introduce a nationwide curfew, beginning at 11pm each night,"" he appears to say on one of thousands of TikTok videos of him posted in last six months. ""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok. By Dec 19, most appeared to have been removed from the platform. Howard said the use of AI in politics is increasing rapidly. ""We know it's internationally pervasive now,"" he said. ""Four of every five elections around the world now have AI-generated political junk that is unattributed and clearly misleading.

When the Burj Khalifa opened on January 4, 2010, it did not just take the title of the world’s tallest building, it announced Dubai to the world as a hub of ambition, innovation and architectural daring. More than a decade later, architects and engineers still marvel at how it was done and how the structure continues to stand as a benchmark of engineering excellence. At the centre of that success is Bill Baker, the structural engineer whose pioneering designs made the 828-metre landmark possible.Read on as we explore the groundbreaking systems and safety features that not only helped build Burj Khalifa but keep it safe, stable and relevant in 2026, by design as much as by physics.Did you know that the original concept for the Burj Khalifa was not always as tall as it is today? The building began life planned for about 518 metres but as engineers tested and refined the design, they realised it was possible to go much higher while keeping stability and cost efficiency in check. Through iterative wind-tunnel experiments and modelling, the team increased the design by another 310 metres, roughly the height of the Eiffel Tower, without compromising safety or performance.This refinement was not just ambition, it was engineering evolution. From the outset, the project’s core team, led by Emaar Properties and coordinated with global experts, approached the build with flexibility and scientific rigour. The result is not just a taller building but a smarter one.At the heart of Burj Khalifa’s structural resilience is an innovative design known as the “buttressed core”, a concept developed by Baker and his colleagues at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM). This system uses a central reinforced core shaped like an irregular hexagon, with three wings extending outward in a Y-shaped plan.For its torsional stability, the hexagonal core acts much like an axle, resisting twists and turns that wind forces cause at great heights. For wind resistance, each wing buttresses the others, distributing load evenly and making the structure incredibly stable even in strong gusts. Burj Khalifa's aerodynamic efficiency is credited to the unusual shape that helps “confuse the wind”, so vortices don’t form consistently around the surface, dramatically reducing oscillation forces.This structural system made it possible for Burj Khalifa to break previous height records by a huge margin, not incrementally but dramatically. It is a standard-setter that has since influenced other super-tall buildings around the world.Dubai’s environmental conditions presented unique challenges. With summer temperatures often exceeding 50 °C and desert winds exerting unpredictable force, the design team needed solutions on multiple fronts. For the wind tunnel testing, the team conducted over 40 wind tunnel analyses to model how the building would respond to every possible force, adjusting setbacks and facade angles accordingly.For concrete and cladding, special cladding panels (about 26,000 of them) were hand-cut to fit perfectly and minimise thermal and light stress. Ultra-reflective materials protect the structure from heat gain. For its foundations, instead of sitting directly on loose sand, Burj Khalifa rises from a reinforced concrete mat supported by deep bored piles, anchoring the entire 828-metre tower on solid ground.Beyond these classical engineering feats, modern protective technologies like cathodic corrosion protection help guard steel reinforcement in the foundation from salt-rich groundwater, ensuring a long lifespan for the structure at its base.The Burj Khalifa was designed long before “sustainability” became a global buzzword, yet some of its features anticipated today’s priorities. Its efficient skin design is such that because of its Y-plan, only one-sixth of the building’s surface is exposed to direct sunlight at any time, which reduces solar heat gain and improves cooling efficiency.For fresh water harvesting, instead of letting condensate from air-conditioning systems drain away, the building’s design captures the equivalent of 20 Olympic-size pools of water each year, which is a hidden but smart reuse strategy. For climate-responsive comforts, higher floors benefit from cooler temperatures and clearer air, making upper-level conditions surprisingly pleasant despite the desert environment.From energy efficiency to water management, Burj Khalifa’s design anticipated elements of today’s sustainability standards long before they were industry norms.Fifteen years after opening, the Burj Khalifa stands not just as an architectural icon but as a symbol of what coordinated vision and structural innovation can achieve. Bill Baker himself described the tower as a statement of optimism and ambition, which was part engineering marvel and part cultural milestone that inspires millions of visitors every year.The “Burj Effect” goes beyond tourism as properties with views of the skyscraper command premium prices and the building’s presence reshaped Dubai’s skyline and global image. For Baker and the original design team, the real reward is not just in the height record or technical achievements, it is in seeing how the building continues to stand tall, safe and relevant more than a decade after its completion.Looking ahead, experts say that Burj Khalifa’s core concepts will continue to influence future tall-building design, even as materials and technologies evolve. Baker has hinted that even taller structures, potentially breaching the kilometre mark, are possible, though they would likely require new structural systems and solutions for challenges like vertical transportation and pressure changes at extreme heights.In the meantime, Burj Khalifa remains a testament to the blend of human ambition, scientific rigour and architectural artistry. It is a building that did not just redefine Dubai but reshaped what the world believes is possible in vertical architecture.","The Burj Khalifa opened on January 4, 2010.

How to avoid penalties and stay compliant



Avoid excessive revving or loud acceleration in residential areas. Police specifically target such behaviour as disruptive.

Do not fit unauthorised modifications to engines or exhaust systems without proper approval and documentation.

Be mindful of noise levels at family campsites and sandy outskirts, where enforcement has been active.

Report genuinely disruptive vehicles through official channels to help authorities maintain peace in your neighbourhood.

Broader trend: UAE tightens traffic enforcement







Abu Dhabi is doubling down on road safety and community peace with an intensified campaign against noisy driving and disruptive vehicles, issuing stern warnings and sharp penalties that are now top of mind for motorists across the emirate. As authorities push for safer, quieter streets, drivers are being reminded that excessively loud vehicles that are often the result of unauthorised modifications or reckless behaviour, can carry a hefty Dh2,000 fine and 12 black traffic points, along with other legal consequences under UAE law.The Abu Dhabi Police have publicly stressed that loud, roaring engines and other forms of disruptive driving are not just annoyances, they are public safety concerns. Noise from vehicles can disrupt residents, particularly in family neighbourhoods and sandy outskirts, causing distress to children, the elderly and individuals with medical sensitivities.This enforcement effort comes as part of a broader push to curb reckless driving, curb noise pollution and promote courteous behaviour on the roads. Officers have specifically targeted drivers, often younger motorists, operating vehicles with modified exhausts, unleashed engines or ritually revving machines in residential districts, family campsites and sandy zones near homes.Under Article 20 of the Traffic and Circulation Law, motorists who operate vehicles that cause excessive noise face a Dh2,000 fine and a deduction of 12 black points from their driving licence if found violating the law. These penalties can significantly impact a driver’s record and insurance eligibility over time.In addition to fines for noise, police are also cracking down on unauthorised modifications to engines or chassis, another major contributor to sound pollution. Drivers who make such modifications without approval may face a Dh1,000 fine, 12 traffic points and possible impoundment of their vehicle for up to 30 days under Law No. 5 of 2020. Vehicles impounded for illegal modifications can only be released after paying a Dh10,000 release fee, and if left unclaimed for three months, they may be auctioned off.Authorities have backed up these warnings with action. In a coordinated enforcement operation in Al Ain in early 2025, police seized 106 vehicles found to have excessive modifications that caused loud noise disturbances, highlighting that enforcement isn’t limited to warnings alone but includes real consequences for violators.Officials frame this crackdown as about more than just reducing noise. It is part of enhancing road safety, community wellbeing and traffic order. Loud vehicles and reckless driving habits can distract other road users, potentially increasing the risk of accidents. Noise pollution is also broadly seen as an “uncivilised behaviour” that tarnishes the image of neighbourhoods and disrupts day-to-day life.Abu Dhabi Police have actively encouraged members of the public to report noisy or disruptive vehicles by calling the emergency number (999). This community-assisted approach emphasizes that residents have a role to play in shaping safer, quieter streets.Loud cars and vehicle modifications have become increasingly popular among certain driving enthusiast groups in the UAE, especially those who enjoy customised engines and aftermarket upgrades. However, police have repeatedly reminded motorists that unauthorised enhancements that amplify noise or alter performance are against the law and subject to penalties.Online discussions from local drivers reflect mixed feelings about the enforcement. Some argue that normal engine sounds from stock vehicles should not count as violations, while others emphasize responsible driving behaviour, particularly in residential zones where noise can cause anxiety and stress.RedditIf you drive in Abu Dhabi or plan to visit from another emirate, here’s how to ensure you avoid a hefty fine and black points on your licence:Ultimately, the new enforcement marks a shift towards prioritising everyone’s right to a safe, peaceful environment. Whether you live in a bustling neighbourhood or pass through Abu Dhabi’s streets on the way to work or leisure, these rules remind drivers that personal enjoyment should never come at the expense of public safety and community harmony.As 2026 unfolds, road users in Abu Dhabi, from enthusiastic petrolheads to daily commuters, will be keen to adapt to these measures, ensuring that the emirate’s streets are not just free-flowing but also free from unnecessary noise and disruption.Abu Dhabi’s increasingly stringent approach is part of a wider UAE trend of enhancing road rules and penalties for a variety of traffic violations, from dangerous manoeuvres to excessive vehicle noise. Across the country, authorities actively use technology and patrols to enforce regulations and educate drivers on safety best practices","Abu Dhabi is doubling down on road safety and community peace with an intensified campaign against noisy driving and disruptive vehicles.

Dubai bans beloved BBQ tradition at Jebel Hafeet: Is this overreach?



Barbecue Tradition Meets a Hard Stop at Jebel Hafeet in Dubai: Here’s What’s Changed





Dubai-area officials have introduced a new rule that is catching weekend warriors and outdoor lovers by surprise. Barbecues are now banned in several parking areas at Jebel Hafeet in Al Ain, one of the UAE’s most beloved mountain getaways. Visitors caught lighting up grills in prohibited spots can face fines that escalate with repeated violations, up to Dh4,000 on the third offence, as authorities clamp down on littering and misuse of the scenic site.Jebel Hafeet, with its dramatic mountain road, sprawling views and family-friendly Green Mubazzarah Park, attracts hundreds of thousands of residents and tourists each year, especially during the cooler months. However, growing concern over environmental impact and mounting waste left behind by visitors has led the Department of Municipalities and Transport and Al Ain City Municipality to take action. Multiple warning signs placed across several parking lots and popular picnic spots now clearly spell out that “barbecue/BBQ is strictly prohibited in this area. ”The penalty framework comes from Law No. 2 of 2012 concerning the Preservation of Public Appearance, Health and Tranquility in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, which imposes a Dh1,000 fine for first-time non-compliance, Dh2,000 for repeated violations and Dh4,000 for subsequent offences, giving authorities a stronger tool to protect the area’s natural beauty and visitor experience.For generations, gatherings around BBQs at scenic venues like Jebel Hafeet have been a weekend staple for UAE families and friends, with visitors often packing food and grills to enjoy the cool mountain air. However, the new restrictions echo past efforts in the region to preserve sensitive outdoor sites as similar rules have been enforced at deserts and parks where litter and irresponsible fire use posed environmental and safety risks.Local social media discussions reflect mixed reactions. Some people lament the loss of a beloved tradition, while others point to the environmental cost of charcoal waste and litter left behind after picnics, noting that stricter enforcement may be necessary to safeguard delicate mountain ecosystems and keep the area inviting for future visitors.While barbecuing on Jebel Hafeet’s parking lots and roadside spots is now off-limits, authorities consistently remind residents and tourists that designated areas in public parks across Abu Dhabi, including Al Sulaimi and Al Mebrazah parks, still permit BBQ gatherings in a responsible and regulated way.In short, if you are planning a scenic winter outing to Jebel Hafeet this season, portable or personal grills need to be left at home or limited to official BBQ zones. The ban aims to balance enjoyment of the mountain’s natural charm with preserving the environment and ensuring that everyone can continue to enjoy the stunning landscape for many years to come.","Dubai-area officials have introduced a new rule that is catching weekend warriors and outdoor lovers by surprise.

The Great Indian Kapil Show,





Indian comedy superstar Kapil Sharma is not just making audiences laugh on screen, he’s now serving up comfort food and café vibes in the Middle East. On December 31, 2025, the comedian and television personality opened Kap’s Cafe in Dubai, marking the hospitality brand’s first foray into the Middle East after earlier launching its first international location in Surrey, Canada.Kap’s Cafe Dubai is not your typical coffee spot. The interior design leans into pastel-heavy hues, muted greens and soft pinks with plush seating and statement lighting, creating a space that is both Instagram-friendly and comfortably familiar. The décor is inspired by the visual language ofthe Netflix hit hosted by Sharma that has become one of India’s most watched comedy series globally, giving fans a sense of walking into the show’s world itself.In social media clips shared by the comedian, Sharma appears smiling, greeting visitors and even serving coffee, much like a host welcoming guests into his home, fitting the café’s relaxed and “comfort first” ethos.While the full Dubai menu has not been officially launched yet, early previews suggest a selection rooted in comfort-driven café classics. Fans can likely expect a mix of Indian and Western favourites, similar to the offerings at the Canada location, including:The inclusion of jaggery-infused lime juice, in particular, gives the café a signature drink that speaks to Sharma’s roots and personal taste, making the experience feel less like a corporate chain and more like a beloved local hangout with celebrity charm.The Dubai café opened its doors from 4 pm to midnight on New Year’s Eve, positioning itself as a cosy alternative to the city’s louder nightlife and a welcoming space for Delhi-to-Dubai travellers, fans of the Netflix series and coffee lovers alike. Located in the Al Kifaf area, Kap’s Cafe joins a growing list of celebrity-linked hospitality ventures in the UAE, a market known for its diverse food scene and appetite for global flavours.Kap’s Cafe’s expansion comes amid a backdrop of challenges for the brand. Last year, the Canada location in Surrey made headlines after facing multiple shooting incidents, including three attacks over several months in 2025. Despite these setbacks, the Dubai launch demonstrates Sharma’s resilience and confidence in growing his hospitality venture internationally.The Dubai opening does not just reflect a culinary expansion, it illustrates how celebrities are blending entertainment, personal branding and lifestyle experiences. By drawing inspiration froma Netflix series that has gained traction and viewership across borders, Kap’s Cafe lets fans step into the world of their favourite comedian, turning casual dining into a form of pop-culture engagement.In a city famed for megaprojects and world-class dining, Kap’s Cafe stands out by offering a comfortable, personality-driven space that promises laughter, nostalgia and heartwarming food, all wrapped in the vibe of one of India’s most iconic comedy voices.","Kapil Sharma opened Kap's Cafe in Dubai on December 31, 2025.

"UAE Bank to end SMS OTPs for online transactions from Jan 6, switch to biometric authentication",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-bank-to-end-sms-otps-for-online-transactions-from-jan-6-switch-to-biometric-authentication/articleshow/126303573.cms,"UAE’s big banking change for online card transactions / AI Generated Image

Why are UAE banks ending SMS OTPs?

SIM-Swapping: Criminals trick mobile providers into porting your number to their SIM card, effectively ""stealing"" your identity and receiving your OTPs directly.

Phishing Scams: Fraudsters create fake websites that look exactly like your bank or a delivery service, tricking you into typing your OTP into their hands.

Interception: Advanced hackers can sometimes intercept SMS messages as they travel through the air using outdated ""SS7"" protocols.

What are in-app approvals?



The Trigger: You click ""Pay"" on a shopping website or app.

The Notification: Instead of an SMS, you’ll receive a push notification directly from your bank’s official mobile app.

The Review: When you tap the notification, the app opens to show you the exact merchant name and the amount being charged—no more ""blindly"" entering codes.

The Approval: You confirm the transaction using biometric verification (Face ID or fingerprint) or your secure Smart Pass PIN.

What does the resident need to do now?

Update your bank’s mobile app to the latest version.

Enable push notifications and biometric login in the app settings.

Log in to your account and complete any authentication setup before January 6.

Why should you act now?





If you’ve lived in the UAE for a while, the ""ping"" of an incoming SMS with a six-digit code has been the soundtrack to your online shopping. But that sound is about to become a relic of the past. Starting January 6, 2026, several major UAE banks will officially stop sending One-Time Passwords (OTPs) via text message for online card payments.This isn't just a minor update; it’s a full-scale security revolution mandated by the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE). For years, SMS codes were the gold standard for two-factor authentication, but as hackers became more sophisticated, the ""weak links"" in the SMS system became too big to ignore.By shifting to a mobile-first approach, the UAE is positioning itself as a global leader in protecting its residents' hard-earned money.The primary reason for this change is simple: Security. While SMS is convenient, it travels over open telecommunications networks that were never designed for high-stakes banking.This made them prime targets for three specific types of fraud:According to industry reports, SMS-related fraud caused billions in global losses.In the UAE alone, scams saw a significant jump in recent years, prompting the Central Bank to issue Notice 2025/3057, which effectively bans SMS and email OTPs as a standalone security method.The future of banking in the UAE is ""In-App Authentication."" Instead of waiting for a text and manually typing in a code, the process is now much faster and more integrated. Here is what your next online purchase will look like:This ""closed-loop"" system ensures that the person approving the transaction is physically holding the trusted device. It removes the need for the telephone network entirely, which is also a massive win for travelers who often struggle to receive SMS codes while roaming.This isn’t just a technical update, it affects every resident who shops online or uses digital banking in the UAE.How to prepare:Once SMS OTPs are phased out, you won’t be able to approve online card purchases using text codes. Transactions will be declined unless verified through the bank app. This change also means that iPhone or Android users must ensure their device settings allow notifications from their bank app.If you haven’t already switched to app-based authentication, banks generally recommend doing so well before the deadline to avoid disruptions.This step is part of a larger plan led by the Central Bank of the UAE to strengthen digital banking infrastructure. Regulators have mandated that banks phase out SMS and email OTPs by March 2026 at the latest, although many instituted the change early.The goal is to reduce fraud and align with global best practices, as digital fraud patterns evolve. By moving to in-app authentication with biometric verification and encrypted channels, banks aim to create a more secure, convenient and unified payment experience for customers.","Starting January 6, 2026, several major UAE banks will officially stop sending One-Time Passwords via text message for online card payments.

People entering a house party might expect to see a rack overflowing with shoes by the door. Lately, people entering some startup offices in the US might, too. The “no shoes” trend is spreading in tech offices, with buzzy startups telling employees to leave their Vans and Uggs at the door. Some cover their offices with soft rugs, or offer free slippers. The website noshoes.fun, by Ben Lang, an employee at the shoes-off startup Cursor, lists a dozen-plus startups with such an approach, including several artificial intelligence firms like Replo and Composite.“I’ve only worked at startups that have a no-shoes in office policy,” Lang said on social media in Aug.Workers at Spur, which uses AI to check websites for bugs, don branded slides upon arrival at their office in Manhattan, and guests are asked to do the same, said Sneha Sivakumar, a co-founder and the CEO. The no-shoes policy, she said, “makes it feel like a second home” for her 10 employees.Nick Bloom, a Stanford economist who studies work culture, said the shoes-off trend was partly “the pajama economy in action.” That is, now that people who worked from home during the pandemic are back in the office, they are bringing their home habits with them.","The ""no shoes"" trend is spreading in tech offices.

It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

If you have any queries for Dhirendra Kumar you can drop us an email at: toi.business@timesinternet.in

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Samsung plans to double Gemini-powered AI devices to 800 million in 2026, says co-CEO T M Roh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/samsung-plans-to-double-gemini-powered-ai-devices-to-800-million-in-2026-says-co-ceo-t-m-roh/articleshow/126344246.cms,"No company immune to memory chip shortage





Samsung Electronics co-CEO T M Roh said that the company aims to double the number of its mobile devices with AI features powered by Google's Gemini in 2026. By 2025, the South Korean firm had rolled out Gemini-backed AI features to about 400 million mobile products, including smartphones and tablets. It now plans to boost that figure to 800 million in the current year. “We will apply AI to all products, all functions, and all services as quickly as possible,” Roh told news agency Reuters in his first interview since becoming the company’s co-CEO in November. With the move, Samsung seeks to reclaim its lost crown from Apple in the smartphone market, the report says. It also aims to fend off competition from Chinese rivals not only in mobile telephones, but televisions and home appliances, all overseen by Roh.Roh said that other than search, consumers o frequently use a range of generative AI editing and productivity tools for images and others, as well as translation and summary features on smartphones.As per the report, Roh expects the adoption of AI to accelerate, as Samsung's surveys on awareness of its Galaxy AI brand jumped to a level of 80% from about 30% in just one year. ""Even though the AI technology might seem a bit doubtful right now, within six months to a year, these technologies will become more widespread,"" he said.According to the report, a global shortage of memory chips is a boon to Samsung's mainstay semiconductor business, but it may impact margins on the smartphone business, its second largest revenue source.""As this situation is unprecedented, no company is immune to its impact,"" Roh told the agency, adding that the crisis affects not only mobile phones but other consumer electronics, from TVs to home appliances.He did not rule out raising product prices, saying some impact was ""inevitable"" from a surge in memory chip prices, but Samsung, the world’s No.1 TV maker, is working with partners on longer term strategies to minimise the impact.During the interaction, Roh acknowledged that the market for foldable phones has been growing slower than expected. He attributed this to the engineering complexities and lack of applications suitable for the hardware design, but expected the segment to go mainstream in the next two or three years. He said that a ""very high"" rate of foldable phone users opt for the same segment for their next purchase.","Samsung aims to double the number of its mobile devices with AI features by 2026.
