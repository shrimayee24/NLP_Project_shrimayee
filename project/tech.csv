Golden State Warriors' Stephen Curry’s New 3-Point Record Leaves Damian Lillard and Klay Thompson in the Dust,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/golden-state-warriors-stephen-currys-new-3-point-record-leaves-damian-lillard-and-klay-thompson-in-the-dust/articleshow/118615384.cms,"Credits: NBA

Is Golden State Warriors Stephen Curry’s 3-Point Record the Most Unbreakable Stat in NBA History?

In the realm of NBA three-point shooting, there's Stephen Curry , and then there's everyone else. It's like comparing a supernova to a sparkler. While Damian Lillard and Klay Thompson are certified sharpshooters, Curry's recent exploits are less a demonstration of skill and more a display of basketball sorcery. Take the Golden State Warriors ' recent East Coast swing opener against the Orlando Magic. Even when the Dubs faced a daunting early deficit, Curry, simply rewrote the script.He started slow, almost toying with the Magic, before unleashing a second-quarter inferno. It was almost four minutes into the first quarter before the two-time MVP made his first shot. He scored the opening points of the game for the Warriors after draining a 28-footer. Orlando surged to a 34-23 lead as Curry closed the quarter with five points and two assists. Steph Curry scored 16 points in the second quarter, including the final three-pointer, a 49-footer, which reduced the Magic's lead to 66-52.When you see ""Most games with 9+ 3-pointers made in NBA history,"" it reads:45 — Steph Curry14 — Damian Lillard12 — Klay ThompsonYou don't just see a number, you witness a chasm. A canyon. A continental divide.Lillard and Thompson, two titans of the long ball, are relegated to the 'also-rans' section of the Curry story. It's not a slight on their abilities, but a testament to Curry's otherworldly consistency. They're like elite chefs forced to watch a culinary demigod effortlessly whip up a five-star meal while blindfolded. Imagine trying to explain to a casual fan that someone has more than three times the number of elite shooting performances than their closest competitors. It's like explaining quantum physics with interpretive dance.ALSO READ: Why Kevin Durant Said NO: The Real Reason He Killed Potential Golden State Warriors Trade Curry's dominance isn't just about making shots; it's about altering the very fabric of the game. He's redefined what's possible, forcing defenses to stretch to absurd lengths, and inspiring a generation of kids to launch shots from the logo. So, while Lillard and Thompson continue to light up scoreboards, Curry's legacy is etched in a different stratosphere, a place where gravity bends and three-pointers fall like rain.",Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry is the most prolific three-point shooter in NBA history. Curry has made more three-pointers than Damian Lillard and Klay Thompson combined.

NBA Halftime Show Gets a Tollywood Twist with Allu Arjun’s Pushpa 2

Forget the sandalwood smuggling, Pushpa Raj is now trafficking global pop culture domination. Yes, you read that right. Pushpa 2 : The Rule, a film that's already ignited a firestorm of anticipation in India, has now crashed the NBA halftime show. Think of it: Allu Arjun 's swagger, Devi Sri Prasad 's infectious beats, and the iconic Thaggede le mantra echoing through an American basketball arena. It's a crossover so wild, you'd swear it was scripted by a fever dream.So, how did Peelings , the track from Pushpa 2, find its way onto the Houston Rockets vs. Milwaukee Bucks halftime stage? It's a testament to the sheer, undeniable power of infectious music and a cultural moment that's transcending geographical boundaries. A video capturing the spectacle has exploded online, showcasing dancers in vibrant blue and gold, channeling the energy of the song and, of course, the signature Pushpa Raj attitude.This isn't just a fun dance performance, it's a massive win for Pushpa 2. It's a declaration that Indian cinema, particularly Telugu cinema, is no longer confined to its traditional audience. The NBA halftime show is a coveted platform, a global stage watched by millions. For Pushpa 2, this exposure translates to unprecedented international visibility, building hype far beyond the film's initial release. It's a strategic move, a cultural infiltration that's cleverly tapping into the global appetite for vibrant, engaging entertainment.While Peelings is grabbing headlines, it's worth noting that this isn't the first Telugu song to grace an NBA halftime. Kurchi Madathapetti from Guntur Kaaram also brought the Telugu groove to the basketball court. However, the sheer anticipation surrounding Pushpa 2 elevates this moment to another level. The film's already established fanbase, coupled with the global reach of the NBA, creates a potent cocktail of cultural exchange.ALSO READ: Kyrie Irving Makes Fan’s Dream Come True with Custom Sneakers Surprise vs Los Angeles Lakers The Pushpa 2 team's ambition to go global is clearly paying off.

Another day, another GTA 6 rumor — but this time, it’s got a ""dev"" involved.

A Rockstar ‘Dev’ Suggests GTA 6 Is Still Set for 2025

I’m at a studio working on what will be 2025’s biggest release and we had celebration plans for releasing our reveal trailer which were completely thwarted when the trailer leaked the night before.

Fans Aren’t Buying It — Here’s Why

Obviously someone pretending to be an employee

I would guess that there's just a small group of executives that are deciding the release date, and there's a good chance they still have not decided if they are going to delay or not. I think most of the R* employees will find out the release date about the same time as the general public

Rockstar’s Silence and Crackdown on Leaks

So… Is GTA 6 Really Dropping in 2025?

The buzz aroundjust got louder after someone claiming to be a Rockstar Games developer dropped hints about the highly-anticipated game still being on track for its 2025 release. But instead of celebrating, fans are side-eyeing the whole thing.After’s epic reveal at the end of 2023 — giving us our first look at modern-day Vice City — Rockstar has been unusually quiet. While publisher Take-Two Interactive insists the game is still scheduled for 2025, rumors of delays have kept swirling.Now, a supposed Rockstar dev added fuel to the fire in a since-deleted post, saying:The “dev” also admitted that leaks, like the infamous pre-trailer leak last year, were a ""mood killer"" for the team — even though Rockstar doesn’t officially discourage developers after such incidents.While the comment sounds juicy, manyfans are calling cap.” one user pointed out, doubting any real Rockstar employee would risk spilling secrets online.Another added, “.”Basically, fans think the release date is too tightly guarded for a random dev to casually confirm it on Reddit — especially since Rockstar is known for keeping everything under lock and key.Since the trailer leak last year, Rockstar has been cracking down on leaks by bringing staff back into the office — ending remote work for many.This move wasn’t exactly popular among devs, but it shows how seriously Rockstar is taking the situation. They clearly want every detail aboutto be on their terms, making it even harder to believe someone would just casually post about the release date online.At this point, it’s a waiting game. The 2025 release is still the official word, but with Rockstar’s silence and these sketchy “dev” leaks, fans are keeping their expectations in check.Until Rockstar drops another bombshell, it looks like the only thing we can do is rewatch the trailer and count down the days to 2025 — with acautious side-eye.Would you trust a supposed “dev” leak like this?

Lucia: The Groundbreaking Protagonist Redefining GTA



Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1

The Significance of Lucia’s Inclusion in GTA 6



The Bonnie-and-Clyde Effect in GTA 6



How Lucia's Inclusion Affects Gameplay



A Defining Moment for Rockstar



The revelation that Lucia will become the first-ever female protagonist within the Grand Theft Auto series marks a turning point for Rockstar Games and gaming as a whole. GTA 6 will mark a long-anticipated shift, shattering well-established traditions to include a lead female character for the first time, offering unique insights into narratives, gameplay styles, and diversification. With this bold act, much anticipatory hype has been generated between fans and pundits.For more than two decades, the GTA series has focused on male protagonists, from Claude in GTA 3 to Franklin, Michael, and Trevor in GTA 5. Introducing Lucia makes it clear that Rockstar is serious about changing with the times and appealing to a wider, more varied audience. Not only does she subvert gaming's traditional gender roles, but she also provides new narrative directions unexplored within the series before.Including Lucia in GTA 6 injects a totally new direction to the game's storyline. The first female protagonist, her backstory will most certainly explore new dynamics between characters and inter-personal tensions that define her as distinct from other past protagonists. Rockstar's move to include a female character as the title face for the game follows the increasing trend towards gender representation in high-level gaming franchises, recognizing the need for greater inclusivity in storytelling. In addition to representation, the presence of Lucia in GTA 6 holds potential for new gameplay mechanics, including divergent heist tactics, mission structures centered around relationships, and special character powers that will revolutionize the way players interact with the game's world.The trailer for GTA 6 suggests a Bonnie-and-Clyde-themed story, where Lucia is paired with a male companion involved in a criminal enterprise. The implication of this is that Rockstar is tightening its approach to storytelling through an emphasis on character relationships. The dual-protagonist model, which was successful in GTA 5, may return as a way for players to enjoy the game's events from multiple viewpoints. Also, Lucia's background could bring in new factions and conflicts within the Vice City-based environment, deepening the story further. Her character also could defy crime saga conventions, providing a morally nuanced and complex protagonist who adds mystery to the story.Aside from altering the story, Lucia's addition could retool GTA 6's gameplay. Rockstar has a history of breaking the mold of open-world gaming, and Lucia's character could bring mechanics specific to her personality. Players could experience new relationship-based interactions that affect mission success, more role-playing depth that enables Lucia's story to be influenced by moral decisions, and gameplay additions that make the world feel more real than ever. These developments would be a game-changer for the series, making GTA 6 one of the most engaging installments in the franchise so far.Lucia's status as GTA 6's female protagonist is not just a milestone; it's a statement about the direction of the series. By embracing both diverse storytelling and gameplay options, Rockstar is raising the bar for open-world games. As the hype for GTA 6 remains strong, Lucia has become a defining characteristic that may redefine the series for years to come.Also Read: GTA 6 Second Trailer: Expected Release Date, Plot Details, Protagonists, and More","Lucia will become the first-ever female protagonist within the Grand Theft Auto series.

When and where to watch the Memphis Grizzlies play tonight against the New York Knicks (February 28, 2025)?

The Memphis Grizzlies are gearing up for a high-stakes showdown against the New York Knicks on Friday, February 28, at FedExForum, but all eyes are on the injury report, particularly the status of star guard Ja Morant. Ja Morant , who has been a key contributor for the Grizzlies this season, is currently listed as fit to play in tonight’s game. His availability for the game remains uncertain, leaving fans and analysts speculating about his potential impact on the court. In his last 20 games, Morant has averaged 14.8 points, 2.8 rebounds, and 5.3 assists, showcasing his ability to facilitate the offense and create scoring opportunities.The Grizzlies’ injury report also includes Zyon Pullin, who is out with a knee injury, and Desmond Bane, who is day-to-day with a groin issue. Bane’s status adds another layer of concern for Memphis, as he has been a consistent performer, averaging 18.4 points, 5.1 rebounds, and 5.4 assists over the same 20-game span.Memphis, currently tied with the Knicks at 38-20, relies heavily on its offensive firepower, leading the NBA with 123.3 points per game. However, the potential absence of Ja Morant and Bane could disrupt their rhythm, especially against a Knicks team known for its defensive tenacity.On the other side, the Knicks are dealing with their own injury concerns. Karl-Anthony Towns is questionable with a lower-body issue, while Josh Hart and Mitchell Robinson are also listed as questionable with knee and ankle injuries, respectively. Ariel Hukporti remains out with a knee injury.The game, set to tip off at 8 p.m. ET, will be broadcast on FDSSE and MSG, with live streaming available on Fubo.

Cam Newton Defends Shilo and Shedeur Sanders Amid Nepotism Criticism



Cam Newton Gets Real About Dating NFL Stars, NO. 1 Pick Expectations + Using ChatGPT To Get Girls!?

Shilo Sanders and Shedeur Sanders have faced an intense amount of criticism throughout their football careers, with many attributing their success to nepotism due to their father, Deion Sanders . While living up to Deion’s legendary legacy is already a challenge, the added scrutiny has made their journey even more demanding. However, NFL veteran Cam Newton is not swayed by the ‘unfair advantage’ narrative surrounding the Sanders brothers.Not everyone can be criticized as nepotism product, at least Cam Newton does not think so. During an episode of Unapologetically Angel, Newton recently pointed out the frequent use of the term nepotism, emphasizing, ""They come up with all types of societal words and this year we’ve heard nepotism as much as any other thing."" Despite the criticism, Newton stands firmly in support of Deion Sanders, praising his role as a dedicated father who is actively shaping his sons' futures.Newton's perspective on the issue is deeply personal, as he is also a father guiding his children through the world of sports. With eight kids of his own, Newton is no stranger to the pressures and responsibilities of parenthood. His eldest son, Chosen Sebastian, is already making his mark in football, basketball, and track and field, while his daughter Sovereign-Dior Cambella and son Camidas Swain are actively participating in multiple sports.Having been in Deion’s shoes, Newton understands the importance of providing opportunities for his children. He also acknowledges the stigma surrounding Black fathers in society and believes that Deion has shattered those stereotypes. ""What Deion Sanders has been doing and has displayed, has been nothing less of a proud father,"" Newton explained. He emphasized that Deion’s active involvement in his children’s lives challenges the misconceptions about Black fatherhood, stating that Sanders has been ""smushing, killing, flushing, and murdering any type of thought process of what a Black father would be in this country.""Interestingly, Newton himself is a product of nepotism. His father, Cecil Newton Sr., played as a safety for the Cowboys and Bills in the 1980s, which helped Cam access valuable coaching and resources early in his career. However, Newton argues that while connections can open doors, maintaining success requires hard work and talent, which Shilo and Shedeur have undoubtedly demonstrated.Deion Sanders' impact on his sons goes beyond the football field. He has been a hands-on father, guiding Shilo and Shedeur through their athletic journeys and helping them shine even in challenging environments like Colorado’s football program. Their success story in the Big 12, despite the team’s struggles, shows their talent and Deion’s dedication.Newton defends Deion's actions, stating, ""To have been doing what he’s been doing for all of his kids, not just one or two of them, has been commendable, and for anybody who doesn’t like it, you just have to ask what would you do in that situation… If somebody’s son is good enough to play, of course, you want your son to play for you and you’re lying if you don’t."" This perspective resonates with many parents who wish to see their children succeed.Also Read: Justin Tucker’s sexual misconduct allegations spark debate over equal treatment with Browns' Deshaun Watson While critics may continue to label Shilo and Shedeur as beneficiaries of nepotism, Cam Newton views Deion’s efforts as a blueprint of fatherhood — a father ensuring his children carry on his legacy. The journey has not been easy, but the Sanders brothers are proving their worth on the field, showing that talent and perseverance are what truly define success.","Cam Newton has defended Shilo and Shedeur Sanders amid nepotism criticism.

But this has not gone down too well with the fans, and Joe Burrow is being brutally trolled for it.As per the recent ranking, their food's freshness was rated 5.49/1,0 while their food had an average rating of 4.82 out of 10. Unfortunately, the Cincinnati Bengals’ cafeteria food and freshness has ranked last among all teams. But fans are in no mood for any sympathy and have dragged Joe Burrow into this.Warren Sharp recently made a post that read as “Bengals Cafeteria worse than prison” and fans have attacked the players. A fan wrote, “LMAO poor burrow has to walk thru traffic to get to the practice field and then they don't even feed him”, while another fan wrote, “Joe Burrow bringing his meals to the facility so he can eat.”A third fan wrote, “They need to save all that money to pay Joe, Chase and Higgins”, while another user wrote, “Imagine what Joe Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase could do if they were served food greater than middle school cafeteria level.”Many fans also spoke about how the players have a massive net worth, and yet they are complaining about the food that is being served. A fan wrote, “Teams should supply some food. But why should they supply 3 meals a day? These guys make millions in most cases. They can feed themselves a meal or two a day.”Other fans are confused how it is possible for the Cincinnati Bengals to serve low quality food. A fan wrote, “How in the world could it be possible to have such a fiasco in a multi-billion-dollar business?”The team, Cincinnati Bengals, has not issued a statement about this poor ranking yet. It is not just the food that the team has ranked pretty poorly in. As per Warren Sharp’s post, even the dining area has been ranked poorly and got a score of 5.98 out of 10, which has ranked it in the 30th place out of 32 teams.Apart from this, the Cincinnati Bengals are also asking for three meals a day instead of two. Apparently, the Cincinnati Bengals are one of two teams that dont provide three meals a day.A statement from the team and the players is yet to be issued. Joe Burrow too is yet to react on the trolling he has received. Apart from this controversy, there are a lot of rumours about his personal life but Joe Burrow has kept it private.Also Read: Joe Burrow’s old video resurfaces as he talks about quirky topics and fans fall for his ""nerdy"" charm","Cincinnati Bengals' cafeteria food and freshness has ranked last among all teams.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Miami Heat’s injury report for tonight’s game against the Indiana Pacers (February 28, 2025)

When and where to watch the Indiana Pacers play tonight against the Miami Heat (February 28, 2025)?

The Indiana Pacers are set to take on the Miami Heat this Friday, February 28, at 8 p.m. ET, but all eyes are on the injury report, particularly the status of star guard Tyrese Haliburton. While Haliburton isn’t listed on the Pacers’ injury report, his recent performance and health remain critical as Indiana looks to maintain its playoff push. Tyrese Haliburton is fit to play tonight against the Miami Heat. The Pacers’ injury report currently features two players: T.J. McConnell, who is questionable with an ankle injury, and Isaiah Jackson, who is out for the season with a calf issue. McConnell’s potential absence could impact the team’s depth, but Haliburton’s availability ensures the Pacers retain their primary playmaker. Over the last 20 games, Haliburton has been a steady force, averaging 17.4 points, 8.2 assists, and 2.9 three-pointers per game, making him one of the team’s most reliable contributors.On the other side, the Miami Heat are dealing with their own injury woes. Bam Adebayo, a cornerstone of their lineup, is questionable with a calf injury, while Andrew Wiggins is also questionable due to an ankle issue. Nikola Jovic (hand) and Dru Smith (Achilles) are out, with Smith sidelined for the season. These absences could tilt the game in Indiana’s favor, especially if Adebayo is unable to suit up.The Pacers enter the matchup with a 33-24 record, outperforming opponents by 1.2 points per game. Their offense ranks ninth in the league, scoring 116.4 points per game, while their defense sits at 20th, allowing 115.2 points. Tyrese Haliburton’s ability to stretch the floor with his three-point shooting (18th in the NBA) and facilitate for teammates like Pascal Siakam (21.6 points per game) will be crucial against Miami’s seventh-ranked defense.Miami, meanwhile, has struggled offensively, ranking 24th with 110 points per game. Tyler Herro, their leading scorer at 24 points per game, will need to step up if Adebayo is limited or unavailable.As both teams prepare for this pivotal Eastern Conference clash, Tyrese Haliburton’s health and performance could be the difference-maker. Fans can catch the action live on FDSSUN and FDSIN or stream it via Fubo, with regional restrictions applying.Also read: Will Bam Adebayo play tonight against the Indiana Pacers?

Accidental activation raises safety concerns

What affected customers should do

Health Canada has issued a warning over certain LG free-standing electric ranges due to a fire hazard caused by accidental activation of the front knobs. The advisory, posted on Wednesday, follows reports of incidents where the stovetop elements were unintentionally turned on by people or pets, reports CBS news.According to Health Canada, the issue affects more than 137,000 units sold in the country between 2016 and June 2024. As of February 12, LG Electronics Canada had received eight reports of such incidents, including two minor injuries—a cut and a burn.The affected models have five stovetop elements and control knobs positioned at the front, just above the oven door. If accidentally bumped, these knobs can turn on the heating elements, posing a fire risk.A similar recall has been issued in the United States, where approximately 500,000 units were sold between 2015 and January 2025. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission reported at least 86 cases of unintended activation, resulting in eight minor injuries and five fires, with property damage exceeding $340,000 USD. Tragically, three of these fires involved pet fatalities.Owners of the recalled models do not need to discard their stoves but should take immediate action. LG Electronics Canada advises customers to check the model number, which can be found inside the oven door or storage drawer, and compare it with the recall list.Once identified, customers should contact LG to receive a free warning label and instructions on its placement. The label serves as a reminder to use the ""Lock Out/Control Lock"" function, which disables the heating elements when the range is not in use. LG has also provided an instructional video demonstrating how to activate this safety feature.","Health Canada has issued a warning over certain LG free-standing electric ranges due to a fire hazard caused by accidental activation of the front knobs.

Carl Feynman: 'I'm outdone in minutes': Computer engineer says AI has surpassed years of his work in a flash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/im-outdone-in-minutes-computer-engineer-says-ai-has-surpassed-years-of-his-work-in-a-flash/articleshow/118596710.cms,"Carl Feynman

Who is Carl Feynman?

Carl Feynman , son of American theoretical physicist Richard Feynman , pioneered cloth simulation in computer graphics at MIT in 1986. He found AI's rapid progress both fascinating and worrying. After seeing an AI create a cloth animation in minutes, he shared his thoughts on X, noting how quickly artificial intelligence is outpacing human effort.“I’m outdone by an AI in a few minutes. They still pay me, but for how long?” Feynman posted, acknowledging how quickly AI models are mastering complex simulations that once required months of research and powerful computers.The conversation began when an X user shared their experience with Sonnet 3.7, an AI model with reasoning capabilities, which successfully generated an intricate cloth simulation in p5.js—a task that had stumped other leading AI models, including Grok 3 and o1 Pro.""Can you write the most intricate cloth simulation in p5js,"" was the prompt put by the X user.Recognizing the significance of this breakthrough, the user said: “Wow, Sonnet 3.7 w/ Thinking just solved a problem no other model could solve yet.”The reaction by Feynman to the simulation quickly gained traction, with the user pointing out Feynman’s legacy: “The man who literally invented modeling cloth in computer graphics at MIT in 1986 saw the video where Claude creates a cloth animation and says: ‘I’m outdone by an AI in a few minutes. They still pay me, but for how long?’”Carl Feynman, the son of renowned physicist Richard Feynman, made significant contributions to computer graphics by developing early methods for simulating cloth movement. His work laid the groundwork for realistic fabric simulations used in films, video games, and virtual reality. In 1986, his master’s thesis, “Modeling the Appearance of Cloth,” was a pioneering achievement in the field.Reflecting on that time, Feynman noted: “It took library research and cleverness and originality and months of work and days of time on big computers. Now I’m outdone by an AI in a few minutes.”While AI continues to break barriers in computational creativity, Feynman’s words highlight an underlying concern: the speed at which AI is advancing, raising questions about the future of human expertise in fields that once relied on deep technical skill and years of experience.","Carl Feynman pioneered cloth simulation in computer graphics at MIT in 1986.

Seven planets to align tonight: How and when to watch rare planetary parade in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/seven-planets-to-align-tonight-how-and-when-to-watch-rare-planetary-parade-in-us/articleshow/118623046.cms,"Best time and how to watch

How long will the planetary parade be visible?



When is the next planetary parade?



Skygazers across the United States are set to witness a rare astronomical event tonight as seven planets—Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Venus, Neptune, Mercury, and Saturn—align in what is known as a planetary parade. This celestial phenomenon, which last occurred in January, will be visible briefly just after sunset.According to NASA, ""planet parade"" isn't a technical term in astronomy, but planetary alignments, especially those involving four or more planets, are noteworthy and infrequent. The event occurs when multiple planets appear in close proximity in the sky along the ecliptic plane, creating the illusion of a cosmic lineup.The planetary parade is expected to be visible just after dusk on February 28, according to Sky at Night Magazine. The best viewing conditions require a dark location with minimal light pollution and an unobstructed view of the western horizon.NASA states that while all seven planets will technically align, not all of them will be visible to the naked eye. Mercury and Saturn, which will be positioned close to the Sun and low in the horizon, might be harder to spot. However, Venus—being the brightest—will be near the Pisces constellation, while Mars will appear reddish and high in the sky, close to Gemini.For those hoping to catch Uranus and Neptune, a telescope will be necessary. Uranus will be located in the Aries constellation, and Neptune will be near Pisces, according to Star Walk, a skywatching app.The alignment will last only a few minutes after sunset, as the planets near the horizon—Saturn and Mercury—will quickly set. Once they dip below the horizon, they will no longer be visible, but the other planets will linger in the night sky for a longer duration.Planetary alignments featuring multiple bright planets are rare. According to NASA, a similar seven-planet alignment is not expected to occur again until 2040.Tonight’s event presents a rare opportunity for astronomy enthusiasts and casual observers alike. To maximize your chances of witnessing this celestial spectacle, head to an area with clear skies, minimal light pollution, and a broad view of the western horizon.","Planetary alignments featuring multiple bright planets are rare.

"Jeffrey Epstein files: Justice department releases Jeffrey Epstein files, but critics say they lack new revelations",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/classified-or-declassified-justice-department-releases-jeffrey-epstein-files-but-critics-say-they-lack-new-revelations/articleshow/118614418.cms,"Conservative commentators outside White House with “The Epstein Files: Phase 1”

The US Department of Justice (DOJ) on Thursday released a set of government documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender. Conservative influencers exiting the White House were seen carrying white binders labeled ""The Epstein Files: Phase 1,"" featuring the DOJ seal, and some held them up for cameras. The release came after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who was confirmed earlier this month, had pledged to make files public, including flight logs and names of individuals involved. However, she had cautioned that certain information would remain undisclosed to protect over 250 victims.Despite the anticipation surrounding the release, the DOJ later acknowledged that the files contained little new information. A review of the documents found them heavily redacted and largely composed of details that had already been publicly reported. While the binders were marked ""declassified,"" it remained unclear whether they had ever been classified in the first place.The limited scope of the release led to criticism, even from some Republicans. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), who leads a House GOP task force on government transparency, voiced her disappointment, stating, ""I nor the task force were given or reviewed the Epstein documents being released today … A NY Post story just revealed that the documents will simply be Epstein’s phonebook. THIS IS NOT WHAT WE OR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ASKED FOR and a complete disappointment. GET US THE INFORMATION WE ASKED FOR!""The manner of the release also sparked controversy online, as the DOJ provided access to the files to a select group of conservative commentators, including Rogan O’Handley (DC Draino), Libs of TikTok creator Chaya Raichik, podcaster Liz Wheeler, and Jack Posobiec, among others. By Thursday evening, the files had not been made available to DOJ reporters or posted publicly online, leading to criticism that the rollout resembled the 'Twitter Files'—the selective disclosure of internal Twitter communications by Elon Musk to independent journalists in 2022-23.Social media users questioned why the DOJ had chosen to distribute the documents exclusively to certain influencers rather than making them accessible to the general public. “Trump did exactly what I was afraid of, just like Elon did with the 'Twitter Files.' The Epstein files should have been released on a website to the public, not just to a few select people. Any of these ‘influencers’ who don’t immediately scan and publicly post the entire binder will have outed themselves as a grifting gatekeeping POS,” one person wrote on X.Another commenter stated, ""Not blackpilling, but today's Epstein stunt is unfortunately delegitimizing and a poor attempt at recreating some kind of 'Twitter Files' type exposé. We have all the power now, so we don’t need influencers to leak stuff. Use the government. That’s why we put you in power.""The criticism highlighted concerns over transparency and the selective nature of the document distribution. Many argued that the DOJ should have published the files on an official government website, rather than allowing certain influencers to control how and when the information was shared. “This smells like the Twitter Files again. Select individuals receive the information and decide how to release it. Create a link on a government website and every American can access and review it. Why the gatekeeping? I hope I am wrong,” another user wrote.Epstein’s criminal history has been well-documented over the years, with multiple lawsuits, police reports, and public disclosures outlining his abuse of underage girls, some as young as 14. His crimes allegedly involved high-profile figures, including politicians, celebrities, and royalty. His death in 2019, ruled a suicide while awaiting trial in a Manhattan jail, only fueled speculation and calls for greater transparency regarding his connections and the extent of his criminal network.In January 2024, a court unsealed a significant batch of documents from a lawsuit filed by one of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Giuffre. The materials included police reports and victim testimonies that had already been widely circulated. Bondi, in her interview with Fox News ahead of the document release, hinted at their contents but stopped short of confirming whether they would contain new revelations beyond what was already known.The DOJ’s move to release the files was framed as part of its commitment to transparency. However, with many of the materials already publicly available and key details redacted, critics—both online and in Congress—expressed disappointment, arguing that the public deserved full disclosure rather than a controlled release through select individuals.","The US Department of Justice on Thursday released a set of government documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

“They are really interesting, but I’m afraid it didn’t have a thing to do with it,” Janoff said. “Somebody starts it, and then people go, ‘Oh yeah, that must be it.’ But it’s all BS.”

The story behind Apple's logo

Why Apple's logo has a bite: The real reason revealed

“It was initially meant to indicate that it was an apple, and not something else,”

“Metaphorically, the bite indicated biting into all the knowledge users would get out of this computer.”

Apple logo’s ‘Byte’ myth: The accidental wordplay that stuck

“I wasn’t computer literate enough to see that initially,”

“But I was like, there’s a bit of wit that will last!”

Apple logo’s timeless appeal: Simplicity, evolution, and a lasting legacy

“People can’t remember complicated things. They can remember simple things,”

The Apple logo , one of the most recognisable symbols in the world, has been surrounded by speculation and myths for decades. The logo’s distinct bite mark has fueled theories ranging from biblical references to technological puns. Many have linked it to the story of Adam and Eve’s forbidden fruit, while others suggest it was inspired by Isaac Newton’s discovery of gravity. Perhaps the most famous theory is that the missing chunk represents a play on the word “byte,” a unit of digital data in computing.However, Rob Janoff , the graphic designer behind the logo, has finally set the record straight. In a recent interview, he dismissed these long-standing rumors, revealing that the true reason behind the design choice is far simpler than many had imagined. His explanation sheds light on Apple’s early branding strategy and highlights the role of simplicity in creating a lasting brand identity.For years, tech enthusiasts and Apple fans have insisted that the Apple logo's bite mark was a clever nod to computing terminology. The theory gained traction across social media platforms like Twitter and TikTok, with users praising the design as a subtle yet brilliant reference to digital technology.However, in an interview with Creative Bits, Janoff debunked the claim, calling it nothing more than an urban legend.Despite the widespread belief in the “byte” theory, Janoff clarified that the bite was added for a much simpler reason—to ensure that the fruit was instantly recognizable as an apple rather than any other round fruit like a cherry or peach.The Apple logo was created in 1977 when Janoff was working for the advertising agency Regis McKenna, which was responsible for Apple's branding during its early years. At the time, Apple was still a small company, and its founders, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, were looking for a logo that would represent their vision of computing in a way that was both innovative and user-friendly.Janoff was given little direction for the design, apart from Jobs’ insistence that the logo should not be “cute.” Taking creative liberty, Janoff decided to use a simple apple silhouette, which combined a natural, organic image with the futuristic vision of computers.The decision to add a bite mark to the apple was purely practical. Janoff wanted to make sure that the fruit would be instantly identifiable as an apple, as opposed to a cherry, peach, or any other round fruit.Janoff explained in an interview with Forbes.Though this explanation is far less mysterious than the byte-bite theory, it highlights the importance of clarity in design. By ensuring that the apple was easily recognizable, Janoff created a logo that would become one of the most iconic symbols in corporate history.Interestingly, while Janoff never intended the bite to be a reference to computing, the pun was noticed shortly after the logo's creation. His creative director, Chip, was the first to point out the connection between “bite” and “byte.”Janoff admitted.Even though the connection was unintentional, the wordplay became an enduring part of Apple’s brand identity. Over time, the idea that the logo was a clever technological reference became so widely accepted that many assumed it had been the original intent.The original Apple logo featured a rainbow-striped apple, which was introduced to highlight Apple's groundbreaking color display technology. As the company grew, the logo underwent several changes, transitioning to monochrome and sleeker designs in line with Apple's minimalist aesthetic.Despite these updates, the core design has remained unchanged, proving the strength of Janoff’s original vision. He believes the simplicity of the Apple logo is what makes it so memorable and effective.Janoff stated.He also emphasised that adding a subtle “wink” or a hint of humor to a design makes it more relatable and likable. This philosophy has helped the Apple logo stand the test of time, maintaining its status as one of the most recognizable logos in the world.","Rob Janoff, the graphic designer behind the Apple logo, has debunked the 'byte' theory.
