Do apps charge higher cab fares on iPhones than on Android devices?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/do-apps-charge-higher-cab-fares-on-iphones-than-on-android-devices/articleshow/116665663.cms,"Once firms identify regular user, they inflate fares: Expert

CHENNAI: It's a theory that has been doing the rounds on social media, but is it true? Some commuters have noticed a curious disparity in cab fares displayed simultaneously on Android devices and iPhones for identical rides, which has left them wondering if pricing algorithms on ride-hailing apps are programmed to charge Apple users higher.TOI used an iPhone and Android device simultaneously to search for rides to the same destinations from three locations in Chennai. In each case, the fare displayed was higher on iOS (see graphic).A caveat - this is by no means conclusive evidence. The same searches on another day may throw up different results. Also, the pattern seemed to be limited to single rides and more pronounced over relatively shorter distances. For the record, Uber said it did not have a policy of personalising trip pricing based on the prospective rider's phone. It attributed disparities, if any, to factors such as estimated time, distance, and real-time demand for cabs in a specific area. Ola did not respond to queries from TOI.Experts suggest the disparities stem from how ride-hailing apps access hardware data to which users are required to give consent while installing an app.C Ambigapathy, managing director of ride-hailing platform Fastrack in Chennai, said the central server could easily generate fare estimates tailored to the user's device. ""It is child's play for companies to tweak fares based on hardware details while hiding behind the 'dynamic pricing algorithm' explanation,"" he said.P Ravikumar, former senior director of Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) in Thiruvananthapuram, said aggregators were known to use rapid development tools such as machine learning frameworks (Google Cloud AI, and Azure ML) to refine pricing algorithms. These tools can incorporate variables like device type, app usage frequency, and search patterns to dynamically adjust fares.TOI was unable to independently verify whether that is indeed the case.An Intelligent Transport System expert involved in framing the Union govt's aggregator policy said fare surges weren't limited to differences between phone models. He pointed out that this also applies to frequent app users and those who repeatedly check fares on the same device. ""These platforms rely on user behaviour patterns to adjust pricing dynamically,"" the expert said.Ambigapathy pointed out that companies leverage past data to gauge user loyalty and trust. ""Once they identify a regular user, they inflate fares, confident that the user will eventually book, even if they wait for prices to drop, although they never do.""Ravikumar said it was time for companies to be transparent about their pricing models. ""If factors like estimated time, distance, and ride modes are consistent, users should not face discrimination based on their device.""",Some commuters have noticed a curious disparity in cab fares displayed simultaneously on Android devices and iPhones for identical rides.

NFL Matches On Netflix Are Not Off To A Good Start



Netflix Has Not Learnt From Its Previous Mistakes



One of the most anticipated matches this season is the match between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Pittsburgh Steelers which will start at 1 PM ET today. The game will be streamed exclusively on Netflix but it looks like Netflix has not learnt its lesson of streaming live events and the live streaming is already off to a bad start, even before the match began.Netflix has not been able to improve its operations and now the NFL is suffering because of it. Kay Adams‚Äô audio was not connected for the first 10 seconds of the Christmas broadcast. Not only could people not hear Kay Adams speaking but also the moment Mina Kimes began speaking, Netflix could not keep up. Out of nowhere, Mina Kimes‚Äô commentary was cut off and Netflix started airing its popular show Squid Games‚Äô trailer for the new season, which is releasing tomorrow.NFL fans were left shocked at this poor quality of broadcasting by the streaming giant, Netflix. As many got together with their families and renewed their Netflix subscription to catch the two NFL matches streaming exclusively on Netflix today, fans were left fuming. Many fans took to X to complain about the broadcasting issue. One user wrote, ‚Äú @netflix is already failing the #NFL @NFL livestream and the game has not even started yet. üò°üò≠ @NFL . I knew this would happened based on the Tyson fight experience. #SteelersvsChiefs‚Äù, another user expressed frustration about this exclusive deal between NFL and Netflix and wrote, ‚Äú Absolutely hate @NFL on @netflix . This is garbage.‚ÄùAt the start of this year, Netflix signed a deal worth $150 million with the NFL for the exclusive streaming rights for the two matches that will be held today - the Pittsburgh Steelers going against the Kansas City Chiefs at 1 PM ET today and the Baltimore Ravens going against the Houston Texans at 4:30 PM ET today. Netflix has promoted these matches for couple of months and while people had faith over how Netflix could pull off this job, people started having their doubts when Netflix live streamed the most anticipated boxing match between YouTuber Jake Paul and boxing legend Mike Tyson last month.Beyonc√© also trolled Netflix over streaming concerns ahead of Christmas showdown. Before delivering a halftime performance at the Houston Texans vs. Baltimore Ravens game on Christmas Day, the Grammy-winning artist took a playful jab at the game's streaming platform, Netflix. On December 24, Beyonc√© shared a video on her social media, showing her seated on a football field. Dressed in a flowing cape, oversized hat, and sunglasses, she strummed a banjo to the tune of her hit song ""Texas Hold 'Em,"" adding her signature flair to the moment.Also Read: Russell Wilson goes above and beyond for Steelers' offensive line with $50,000 worth of luxurious Christmas gifts, including Louis Vuitton and exclusive rum Netflix completely messed up the boxing match with the screen freezing at important times which led to people getting really frustrated with Netflix. This cast a heavy doubt on whether Netflix will be able to pull off the two NFL matches on Christmas Day and Netflix reassured that this will be an easy task since they have learnt from their mistakes during the boxing match between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson. But it looks like this was not the case since Netflix is having issues even before the actual game has begun.","Netflix signed a deal worth $150 million with the NFL for the exclusive streaming rights for the two matches that will be held today.

Traveling to foreign countries often reveals stark cultural differences; behaviors considered normal in one place can appear unconventional or even inappropriate in another. This was the case on a Finland train when an NRI got annoyed by a ‚Äòloud‚Äô Indian family on an otherwise quiet train.A user, Gokul Sridhar(@gokul), shared a tweet about his experience in a train compartment which he shared with people including an Indian family.

He expressed his frustration, remarking that Indians often lack "" civic sense .""He posted, ‚ÄúI'm on a train from Lapland to Helsinki and there's one family in the otherwise ULTRA QUIET carriage that's being very loud, talking to someone over a video call.

He updated in the comment section of his post that he somehow ended up in the same restaurant as the family who were again talking to someone loudly and that too without headphones. An X user advised Sridhar, ‚ÄúEasier to stop by and request them to close the door and lower their voice?‚Äù To which he retorts, ‚ÄúYup I'm gonna do that but there shouldn't even be a need for this, is my point.‚ÄùThe post has since received more than 12k views and the comment section has divided reaction to this.

This debut lineup is a dream come true for football enthusiasts, who will see four playoff-bound teams battling for their final seeding.The Steelers (10-5) host the defending Super Bowl champion Chiefs (14-1) at 1 p.m. ET, and the Ravens (10-5) take on the Texans, already assured of the AFC South, at 4:30 p.m. ET. Both the Steelers and Ravens are still in competition for the AFC North crown, making these highly awaited games even more dramatic.All Netflix subscribers, whether using the ad-supported plan at $6.99/month or the premium tier at $22.99/month, are able to enjoy the games live. There are a total of 283 million subscribers worldwide.If you are not a Netflix subscriber but live in Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Houston, or Baltimore, you are able to watch the games on CBS-TV affiliates where you live.The Christmas Day games promise more than thrilling football. Netflix has arranged a fun pre-game show from 11 a.m. ET, which features Mariah Carey's classic ""All I Want for Christmas Is You."" Beyonc√© will perform live at halftime of the Ravens-Texans game, singing songs from her album Cowboy Carter.Netflix is coming from the back of the huge success of Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson boxing match in November. The event peaked at an incredible 65 million concurrent streams, making it one of the biggest moments in Netflix sports streaming history. However, it wasn't all smooth sailing. The stream encountered technical problems, with some viewers facing buffering issues. Will Netflix continue the momentum from the great boxing match and bring a seamless experience for NFL fans? Or will it have another streaming problem? The pressure is on.This is not the NFL's first foray into streaming. Amazon Prime Video, Peacock, and ESPN+ have all previously streamed games, with Amazon leading the charge by hosting Thursday Night Football.

WWE Superstars marrying or getting engaged to each other is nothing new and another such instance has taken place and the fans can‚Äôt contain their joy. RAW Superstar Maxxine Dupri has been officially engaged with NXT talent Anthony Luke. She shared the happy news on different social media platforms, including Instagram . In a flurry of beautiful photos, Dupri also shared a picture of her engagement ring. The talented star wrote ‚Äúforever‚Äù in the caption.Dupri is fast becoming one of the more popular superstars of the ‚ÄúRed Brand‚Äù roster, as she has been a big part of the Alpha Academy, alongside Akira Tozawa and Otis. She has improved leaps and bounds both inside the ring and on the mic and has had some highly entertaining segments with her teammate, Otis and former mentor Chad Gable. Earlier the diva was not essentially known for her stupendous in-ring or mic skills, but the hard work is paying off for her now. She was also involved in a ‚Äúcoming out of the shadow‚Äù storyline with Chad and Otis, where Chad finally left the Alpha Academy alone, and the members of the faction are on their own and ready to flourish on RAW. While Dupri is on ascendance on RAW, her fiance Anthony Luke has been on different live events of NXT and is yet to debut on television. It won‚Äôt be long before he makes a name for himself in the developmental brand of WWE.

Beyonce's Historic Christmas Day Show on Netflix to Transform NFL Viewership,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/beyonces-historic-christmas-day-show-on-netflix-to-transform-nfl-viewership/articleshow/116660540.cms,"Beyonce already has longstanding relationships with Netflix and the NFL (Image Source: Getty)

Beyonce & Mariah Carey‚Äôs Netflix Double Bonanza Can Change Viewership For The NFL



TOMORROW - HOUSTON, TEXAS

NFL fans are divided on Beyonce‚Äôs Christmas Day performance for Netflix‚Äôs NFL Christmas Gameday which will feature matchups between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Kansas City Chiefs, followed by the Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans. While the ‚ÄòBey‚Äôhive is certainly excited about Beyonce‚Äôs show, some NFL fans want the league to distance itself from Beyonce and Jay-Z amid the ongoing allegations against the latter. But irrespective of how her show is received, it‚Äôs clear that Beyonce‚Äôs X-Mas Day set will bring about some changes in festivity-oriented sporting events.Netflix is set to make history on Christmas Day, as it‚Äôs set to broadcast two live NFL games for the first time. The NFL's Christmas activity will kick off at 1:00 p.m. ET, but before the kickoff between Pittsburgh and Kansas City, Mariah Carey will open the show with a taped performance of her iconic festive single, ""All I Want for Christmas Is You."" Beyonc√©'s performance will take place during the second half of Netflix‚Äôs two Christmas Day games when the Houston Texans play against the Baltimore Ravens at NRG Stadium at 4:30 p.m. ET.A few weeks ago, Beyonce‚Äôs husband and rap mogul Shawn ‚ÄúJay-Z‚Äù Carter was hit with a civil lawsuit claiming he assaulted a minor alongside disgraced music mogul Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs. NFL currently has a partnership with Jay-Z‚Äôs company Roc Nation since the rapper co-produces the Super Bowl halftime show.During a meeting with league leaders in Texas earlier this month, commissioner Roger Goodell was asked about the lawsuit and the NFL‚Äôs relationship with Carter. ‚ÄúFrom our standpoint, our relationship is not changing with them, including our preparations for the next Super Bowl,‚Äù Goodell told the media. And though the jury is out on whether Beyonce‚Äôs performance will be met with rave reviews, it is very likely to shift how big gameday events are consumed by sports fans.Last year, the NFL rolled out a three-game slate across different networks on Christmas and managed the highest TV ratings of the season. NBA‚Äôs five-game Christmas schedule saw a 6-1 margin deficit against the NFL, which led to plenty of chatter about how the NFL is eating away NBA‚Äôs ratings.‚ÄúI think we need to seriously consider starting [the season] on Christmas because, listen, you‚Äôre wasting your time going up against the NFL and college football. They own the weekends now,‚Äù NBA and broadcasting legend Charles Barkley told the Dan Patrick Show. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd have the entire calendar to [ourselves].‚ÄùSome experts also pointed out that perhaps the NBA needs an the approach like NFL and turn Christmas games into a spectacle. ‚ÄúI imagine the NBA is going to have to attract viewers on Christmas Day by acquiring headlining talent comparable to Beyonc√© or maybe changing the format of the day‚Äôs programming,‚Äù said Dr. Brittany Proctor-Habil, assistant professor of race and media at The New School. ‚ÄúTelevising NBA [games] from noon to 10:30 PM ET is not as appealing to viewers as it once was.‚ÄùAlso Read: Mariah Carey And Beyonce To Headline NFL‚Äôs Historic Christmas Gameday Show On Netflix Dan Runchie, founder of a company that gives insights on music and sports also agreed that NFl is being savvy with timing and gaining ground over NBA. ‚ÄúIt definitely feels like the NBA lost a bit of that corner. And maybe other corners, too,‚Äù Runchie said.‚ÄúThe NFL has games on Martin Luther King Day now. That‚Äôs another big day for the NBA and for its messaging and trying to honor Dr. King ‚Ä¶ We‚Äôve also heard [rumblings] about the Super Bowl moving down to [Presidents Day Sunday] because they know people have that Monday off. If that happens, every cherished day the NBA has seems like the NFL is coming to creep on it.‚ÄùOn Christmas Day, Netflix is streaming two major games. This year, four key quarterbacks will be starting on Christmas Day, namely, Patrick Mahomes , Russell Wilson , Lamar Jackson and C.J. Stroud; this coupled with a Beyonce conert and a Mariah Carey opening, it‚Äôs a recipe for max viewership. Not to mention the Beyonce set will be streamed in the middle of the most tense stretch of the NFL season which will decide a lot about the playoffs. No wonder fans are considering it a mega event, give or take the Christmas angle.Netflix‚Äôs streaming of a boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul drew well over one hundred million worldwide viewers which made it the most streamed ‚Äúglobal sporting event‚Äù ever. ‚ÄúNow, you place Beyonc√© there, and you have a whole group of fans who will be like, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt care about the game. I just wanna watch this,‚Äô ‚Äù said Randall Williams , a celebrated sports business reporter.It‚Äôs important to note that making viewers switch to Netflix is also leading them to switch off network TV and step away from the slate of festive content that they are familiar with.‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre gonna do that, you want to be able to make it big. And if you‚Äôre gonna make it big, you get Beyonc√© who has been part of some of the more memorable Super Bowl halftime performances we‚Äôve seen,‚Äù said Runchie. ‚ÄúGetting a Super Bowl halftime-level performer to do it on your platform is monumental.‚ÄùWhile fans may question adding Beyonce to a festive roster during a time when her husband faces serious allegations, in some ways it does spell good business for Netflix. Beyonce has already performed on the NFL‚Äôs grandest stage twice; she headlined the Super Bowl in 2013 and 2016 and has a longstanding relationship with Netflix.In 2019, Beyonc√© agreed to a three-project deal worth roughly $60 million with the streamer which resulted in the critically acclaimed 2019 concert film, ‚ÄòHomecoming‚Äô, which documented Beyonce‚Äôs historic Coachella performance. ‚ÄúThis could potentially be the second one, though we‚Äôve yet to see any confirmation on that from either side,‚Äù said Runchie.By making entertainment a big part of sports, especially festive day sporting events, the NFL is essentially approaching the next chapter in viewership. It‚Äôs a way of diversifying its target audiences by not just pulling it on-demand viewers who are switching on the OTT platforms for a festive spectacle but also drawing the viewers who aren‚Äôt interested in NFL but are curious about the entertainment. And this formula may just work wonders for the NFL.","Netflix is set to make history on Christmas Day, as it‚Äôs set to broadcast two live NFL games for the first time.

Sandringham's history and royal tensions

Happier times at Sandringham

The Royal Family gathers at King Charles' Sandringham estate in Norfolk each Christmas, continuing a tradition dating back to Queen Victoria. The 20,000-acre estate, purchased in 1862, holds significant historical value for the family. George V, former king of the UK, famously cherished Sandringham, saying, ""Dear old Sandringham, the place I love better than anywhere else in the world."" More than 160 years after it was first acquired by the royal family, the estate remains a cherished setting for the royal Christmas celebrations.The preparations for the holiday include selecting a large Christmas tree from the estate grounds, a tradition started by King Charles' great-great-great-grandfather, Prince Albert. King Charles selects a 20-foot Norfolk spruce tree from the grounds each year. The tree is typically decorated with red, gold, and purple ornaments, along with twinkling Christmas lights. The Grand Staircase is often adorned with festive decorations, and the Waterloo Chamber is transformed into a winter wonderland.The King also approves menus for Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day. The chef traditionally carves the turkey in front of the guests. However, one change King Charles may make concerns the temperature in the home. Prince Harry previously described Sandringham‚Äôs temperature as ‚Äúbalmy,‚Äù saying, ‚ÄúThe corgis always betrayed us. The cool air would make them whimper, and Granny would say: 'Is there a draft?' And then a footman would promptly shut the window.‚ÄùGuests arrive on Christmas eve based on seniority. As Sandringham is the smallest of the royal residences, some guests may have to sleep in rooms typically reserved for staff. One quirky tradition involves guests weighing themselves upon arrival. A tradition from Edward VII involved weighing guests upon arrival and departure to ensure they were well-fed.The family enjoys afternoon tea at 4 pm, with favorites such as square sandwiches, ham and English mustard, Sage Derby cheese, and Coronation Chicken. Desserts include ginger cake, honey and cream sponge, scones, and a pot of Earl Grey tea.At 6 pm, the family exchanges small, humorous gifts, a nod to the German tradition of ""Heiligabend Bescherung,"" introduced by Prince Albert. Princess Diana once gave Sarah Ferguson a leopard print bath mat, while Kate, Princess of Wales, gifted a ""grow your own girlfriend"" kit to a bachelor Prince Harry.Later in the evening, after the children go to bed, a formal dinner is served for the adults, with men in black tie and women in ballgowns and jewels. The meal is followed by martinis and a lavish four-course feast.Christmas day starts with breakfast and an 11 am church service at St Mary Magdalene Church. The royals greet the crowds as they leave the church. The family returns to Sandringham for pre-lunch drinks, including Veuve Clicquot champagne, and a traditional Christmas dinner at 1 pm. The meal includes turkey, potatoes, vegetables, sprouts, carrots, and parsnips, with Christmas pudding served with brandy butter and brandy sauce, followed by a cheese course with port. The table is decorated with white linen, candelabras, and a sprig of the Holy Thorn, a tradition that dates back before the Reformation.The King's speech is watched on television afterward. The family spends the rest of the afternoon at leisure.In the evening, guests enjoy a buffet of traditional English cuisine, including boar's head, ox tongue, and seafood, along with a table of chocolates and mints.Boxing Day features a hunt for the men, followed by lunch and dinner with traditional dishes. The meal typically consists of hearty fare, such as beef bourguignon with mashed potatoes and red cabbage. For dessert, there is apple pie and Christmas pudding slices fried in unsalted butter. Dinner that evening might feature venison with dauphinoise potatoes and carrots, followed by a chocolate pie made of cream, meringue, and cinnamon.Sandringham has witnessed its share of controversy over the years. Princess Diana, who was often unhappy spending Christmas at the estate, would frequently chat with the staff to avoid family members. Royal chef Darren McGrady recalled how Diana would walk around the kitchen after dinner, seeking refuge from the tight quarters of the estate, which he described as ‚Äúso compact.‚ÄùIn Andrew Morton's biography, Diana was quoted describing a dramatic row with Prince Charles in 1982 when she was pregnant with Prince William. ""I threw myself down the stairs,"" she reportedly said. ""Charles said I was crying wolf, and I said I felt so desperate, and I was crying my eyes out, and he said: 'I'm not going to listen. You're always doing this to me. I'm going riding now.'""Sandringham also hosted a tense summit in January 2020 between King Charles and his sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, after Harry announced he would step back from royal duties. The meeting led to a public statement from the Queen, wishing Harry and Meghan a ‚Äúpeaceful and happy new life.‚Äù Meghan Markle , who enjoyed her first Christmas at Sandringham in 2017, shared a fond memory with her mother. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just like a big family like I always wanted,‚Äù she said during a phone call. ""There was just this constant movement and energy and fun."" Prince Harry also spoke of happier times, saying, ""Christmas was fantastic.""","The Royal Family gathers at King Charles' Sandringham estate in Norfolk each Christmas.

'Diana hated Sandringham'

‚ÄòNo boisterous behavior‚Äô

Disappointment over gag gifts

Familiar yet unwelcome traditions

Royal experts weigh in

Princess Diana reportedly 'hated' spending Christmas with the royal family at Sandringham Estate in UK. Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, revealed that Diana found the royal holiday traditions ‚Äúclaustrophobic.‚ÄùSpeaking to Fox News Digital, Seward explained that Diana felt constrained by the royal customs, saying she did not want to follow so many rules to enjoy herself. ‚ÄúDiana hated Sandringham,‚Äù Seward said. ‚ÄúEven when her romance with Charles was going well, she still didn‚Äôt like it‚Ä¶ I think she found it claustrophobic because Diana was such a free spirit. She didn‚Äôt want to have to enjoy herself with so many rules. [But] they‚Äôre not rules. They‚Äôre just traditions of royalty.‚Äù Seward noted that the order of precedence and other royal traditions made Diana uncomfortable.In his 1992 book Diana: Her True Story, author Andrew Morton recounted Diana‚Äôs experience during her first Christmas at Sandringham in 1981. She had given expensive gifts, while the royal family exchanged gag gifts.‚ÄúIt was highly fraught,‚Äù Diana told Morton. ‚ÄúI know I gave, but I can‚Äôt remember being a receiver. Isn‚Äôt that awful? I do all the presents, and Charles signs the cards. [It was] terrifying and so disappointing. No boisterous behavior, lots of tension, silly behavior, silly jokes that outsiders would find odd, but insiders understood.‚Äù Diana added, ‚ÄúI sure was [an outsider].‚ÄùSeward corroborated this story, sharing that a friend who worked at Sandringham witnessed Diana‚Äôs disappointment. Diana reportedly gave cashmere sweaters and other expensive items but received a simple, less thoughtful gift in return. ‚ÄúShe just couldn‚Äôt understand [it],‚Äù Seward said. ‚ÄúTo her, Christmas was all about spending a bit more than you could probably afford and getting really nice presents.‚ÄùDespite her dislike for the traditions, Diana was familiar with Sandringham as her father had a house on the estate. However, her hairdresser, Richard Dalton, told author Kitty Kelley that Diana ‚Äúhated going to Sandringham for Christmas,‚Äù mentioning the cold and the requirement to watch the Queen‚Äôs Christmas message on television. Dalton referred to it as a ‚Äúcommand performance.‚Äù An unnamed friend also told author Tina Brown that Diana dreaded going to Sandringham.Royal experts shared their views on Diana‚Äôs experience at Sandringham. Hilary Fordwich explained that Diana‚Äôs gift-giving experience was ‚Äúembarrassing and painful,‚Äù as she wasn‚Äôt aware of the family‚Äôs gag gift tradition. Nick Bullen, co-founder of True Royalty TV, commented that the royals exchange ‚Äúsilly joke presents,‚Äù with author Christopher Andersen noting that Queen Elizabeth II preferred gag gifts. Andersen also claimed that Prince Charles‚Äô favorite gift was a toilet seat from Princess Anne.King Charles and Diana had separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996.","Princess Diana reportedly 'hated' spending Christmas with the royal family at Sandringham Estate in UK.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, ‚ÄúTo do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.‚ÄùUsers will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What we found out in our testing

What Uber has to say

A recent social media post alleging that Uber charges different fares for rides booked on iPhones and Android devices has started an online debate. The post, which quickly went viral, showed screenshots of two phones displaying significantly different fares for the same ride. The post ignited speculation among users, with many questioning whether Uber's pricing algorithm discriminates based on the type of device used.Nirali Parekh shared her colleague's experience of booking an Uber in a LinkedIn post. In the post, she highlighted the significant price difference for the same trip when booked using an Android smartphone versus an iPhone.The same post was shared by the Uber user on X (formerly known as Twitter). ‚ÄúSame pickup point, destination & time but 2 different phones get 2 different rates. It happens with me as I always get higher rates on my Uber as compared to my daughter‚Äôs phone. So most of the time, I request her to book my Uber. Does this happen with you also? What is the hack?,‚Äù posted Sudhir on X.To investigate these claims, TOI Tech conducted its own tests. We booked multiple Uber rides using various devices, including budget-friendly Android phones and premium Apple iPhones. However, we did not observe any significant price variations across different devices or locations.Uber quickly responded to the allegations, stating that the observed fare differences were not due to the type of phone used. ""Hi there, multiple differences in these two rides impact the prices. The pick-up point, ETA, and drop-off point on these requests vary, which will cause different fares. Uber does not personalize trip pricing based on a rider's cell phone manufacturer,"" the company explained.","A recent social media post alleging that Uber charges different fares for rides booked on iPhones and Android devices has started an online debate.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle‚Äôs theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you‚Äôve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you‚Äôve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Google Podcasts (2018 ‚Äì 2024)



Keen (2020 ‚Äì 2024)



In 2024, Google once again made headlines by discontinuing several products and services. Known for its vast ecosystem of tools and platforms, Google has always embraced an experimental approach, regularly launching new projects while also sunsetting those that fail to meet its evolving strategic goals or user expectations. This year was no exception, as Google said goodbye to offerings that had carved out unique niches but ultimately fell short of the tech giant‚Äôs ambitions. From Jamboard to the Chromecast , 2024 saw the end of products that, despite their promise, could not sustain relevance in an ever-competitive market. Here‚Äôs a list of products that Google killed in 2024Introduced in 2017, Jamboard was a digital 4K touchscreen whiteboard designed to facilitate real-time collaboration, integrating seamlessly with Google Workspace services. Despite its innovative approach to enhancing team interactions, Google decided to discontinue Jamboard in 2024, citing a strategic shift towards software-based solutions that offer greater flexibility and accessibility across diverse devices.Launched in 2013, Chromecast revolutionized media streaming by allowing users to cast content from their devices directly to their televisions. Over its 11-year lifespan, Chromecast sold over 100 million units, becoming a staple in many households. However, in August 2024, Google announced the discontinuation of the Chromecast line, signaling a move towards more integrated smart TV solutions and advanced streaming devicesAs part of its Google One subscription service, Google introduced a virtual private network (VPN) in 2020, offering users enhanced online privacy by encrypting internet traffic and masking IP addresses. Despite the growing emphasis on online security, the service experienced low adoption rates. Consequently, Google shut down VPN by Google One in June 2024, redirecting resources to other security initiatives.Dropcam, a pioneer in Wi-Fi-enabled security cameras, was acquired by Google in 2014. It allowed users to monitor their homes remotely via live video feeds. In April 2024, Google ended support for Dropcam and Dropcam Pro, encouraging users to transition to the more advanced Nest Cam lineup, which offers enhanced features and better integration with the Google ecosystem.Google Podcasts was launched in 2018 as a platform for discovering and listening to podcasts. Despite amassing over 500 million downloads, the app faced criticism for lacking features compared to competitors. In June 2024, Google announced the discontinuation of Google Podcasts, urging users to migrate to YouTube Music, which now includes podcast support.Keen, introduced in 2020, was an experimental project from Google's Area 120 incubator, aiming to rival Pinterest by allowing users to curate content based on their interests. Despite its unique approach to content discovery, Keen struggled to gain a substantial user base and was shut down in March 2024.The discontinuation of these products reflects Google's dynamic approach to its product lineup, continually reassessing and realigning its offerings to focus on areas with greater user engagement and strategic importance. While the end of these services may disappoint some users, it underscores Google's commitment to innovation and adaptability in the ever-evolving tech landscape.","Google announced the discontinuation of several products and services in 2024.

The 24-hour study by Heat Initiative and ParentsTogether Action reviewed 800 apps and found that problematic apps garnered more than 550 million combined downloads.The investigation uncovered widespread issues across apps rated 4+, 9+, or 12+ in categories like chat, beauty, diet, internet access, and gaming. Among the concerning discoveries were 25 chat apps enabling stranger communication with minors, apps promoting extreme dieting behaviors, and gaming apps soliciting inappropriate photos. Many apps also offered ways to bypass school and home internet filters, even while carrying ratings suitable for young children. Apple takes no legal responsibility for the veracity of age ratings,"" the report stated, despite the company's claims that the App Store is a ""trusted place"" for users. The study found nearly all weight loss and unfiltered internet access apps were approved for children aged four and above. The researchers called for several reforms, including implementation of independent third-party reviews, greater transparency in the app rating process, stronger enforcement of age ratings, and enhanced parental controls.While Apple conducts both automated and manual checks on apps and provides features like Screen Time for child protection, the company acknowledges that "" App Store security measures alone can never be perfect."" With nearly 2 million apps on the platform, comprehensive screening remains challenging. The report's authors emphasized that the most effective protection requires both improved app screening and engaged parenting, recommending that parents actively monitor their children's app usage and verify app safety through personal testing.The findings come amid broader scrutiny of the App Store, including a recent $1.95 billion EU fine over anti-competitive practices in March 2024.

Google Santa tracker: How to use and top features



Google Santa Tracker , is a popular Christmas feature that allows users to track Santa Claus in real time as he delivers presents worldwide. This feature offers a digital way to follow Santa‚Äôs journey on Christmas Eve . Each December 24, Google transforms Santa's Village into an interactive tracking experience, delighting children and adults alike. The platform provides updates on Santa's route, showing his progress as he and his reindeer travel across the globe spreading Christmas cheer. Here‚Äôs how the tradition started:This festive tradition that began in 2004 builds on NORAD's long-standing Santa tracking program but has evolved with Google‚Äôs modern technology, incorporating playful features and educational games to engage users throughout the holiday season.Meanwhile, NORAD‚Äôs tradition of tracking Santa Claus on Christmas Eve began in 1955 when a misprint in a department store advertisement prompted a child to call a Colorado military command centre, hoping to speak with Santa Claus.Air Force Colonel Harry Shoup, who answered the call, pretended to be Santa and reassured the child. As more calls came in, Shoup assigned an officer to manage the enquiries, which started the festive custom that NORAD carried on after its establishment in 1958.For decades, NORAD has paused its regular airspace monitoring duties each holiday season to answer children‚Äôs questions about Santa‚Äôs journey and his remarkable gift-delivery mission. Each year, over 100,000 kids call in to track Santa‚Äôs location, while millions more follow his progress online in nine languages as he travels across the globe spreading holiday cheer.Santa's journey can be tracked using Google‚Äôs tool on iPhone, iPad or Mac by accessing the official Santa Tracking website through a web browser. The site includes a live map displaying Santa's current location, his next stop, a live video feed of his travels, and estimated arrival times for specific locations.The website also showcases photos of places Santa has already visited, a live tally of gifts delivered, and his current distance from the user's location. Additionally, it offers a variety of interactive activities, including games, creative projects, and videos, making the experience engaging and entertaining.","Google Santa Tracker is a popular Christmas feature that allows users to track Santa Claus in real time as he delivers presents worldwide. This feature offers a digital way to follow Santa‚Äôs journey on Christmas Eve. Each December 24, Google transforms Santa's Village into an interactive tracking experience. The platform provides updates on Santa's route, showing his progress as he and his reindeer travel across the globe spreading Christmas cheer.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116634721,imgsize-46512,width-400,resizemode-4/116634721.jpg"

AI systems will have emotions because‚Ä¶

Yann LeCun , Meta ‚Äôs Chief AI Scientist, has made a bold, or rather provocative, prediction: future AI systems will possess emotions. In a recent interview, LeCun explained that emotions are an ‚Äúinseparable component‚Äù of the design of advanced AI systems.‚ÄúSo the blueprint of AI systems that we‚Äôre envisioning, that we‚Äôre going to build over the next few years ‚Äî those AI systems will have emotions. It‚Äôs a basically inseparable component of the design of those systems,‚Äù he said while responding to a question at an interview.He argues that emotions are a natural consequence of AI agents being driven by objectives and goals.‚ÄúWhy would they have emotions? Because they will be driven by objectives,‚Äù LeCun explained. ‚ÄúYou give them a goal that they have to accomplish, a task, and their purpose is to accomplish this task, subject to guardrails that are hardwired into their design,‚Äù he added.‚ÄúAnd for them to do this, they need a number of components. The first component they need is a way to determine whether this goal that we give them was accomplished or not. And what they also need is what we call a world model. What is a world model is something that we all have ‚Äî a prefrontal cortex that allows us to imagine what the consequences of our actions. And it‚Äôs what allows us to plan a sequence of actions to accomplish a particular goal. Now if you have this ability to predict ahead of time what a sequence of action is going to produce, then you can predict whether a goal is going to be satisfied or not. And you can predict if the outcome is going to be good or bad,‚Äù LeCun added.LeCun believes that this ability to predict and react to potential outcomes will give rise to emotions in AI.‚ÄúIf you predict it‚Äôs going to be bad, you feel fear. If you predict it‚Äôs going to be good, it‚Äôs more like elation, right? So, (you‚Äôll need) the ability to predict, and then to act so as to accomplish those predictions (which) produces the equivalent of emotions. So AI systems that are smart enough, that are capable of reasoning and planning, will have emotions,‚Äù he explained.","Yann LeCun, Meta‚Äôs Chief AI Scientist, has made a bold, or rather provocative, prediction: future AI systems will possess emotions.
