'Paneer and milk are not veg': Doctor’s remark triggers online storm over dietary classifications,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/paneer-and-milk-are-not-veg-doctors-remark-triggers-online-storm-over-dietary-classifications/articleshow/118006017.cms,"NEW DELHI: A debate erupted on social media after Dr Sylvia Karpagam, working editor of the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics , questioned the classification of milk and paneer as vegetarian foods.The discussion began when Dr Sunita Sayammagar shared a photo of a thali, describing it as a “vegetarian meal” rich in protein, good fats, and fiber. Responding to the post, Dr Karpagam challenged the notion that dairy products are vegetarian.“Also, paneer and milk are not 'veg.' They are animal source foods ... same like chicken, fish, beef, and all,” she wrote on X.The thali in question included a mix of vegetables such as cucumber, carrots, and onions, alongside paneer, coconut, and dal.Her comment sparked a divided response. Many X users argued that since milk and paneer are derived without killing the animal, they remain vegetarian. Others, however, claimed that labeling dairy as vegetarian was influenced by Western dietary classifications.“No one is killed… to eat paneer or milk,” one X user pointed out.Another user explained, “Milk products are animal products that no animal has to be killed to get, hence it is indeed vegetarian & not vegan. Any killing or harm to animals happens in the milking setup. ‘Veg’ means vegetarian.”In response, Dr Karpagam asked, “So why are eggs not 'veg'?”—a counterpoint that further fueled the debate.","Dr Sylvia Karpagam, working editor of the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics, questioned the classification of milk and paneer as vegetarian foods.

Princess Diana: Prince Harry reveals contacting late mother Princess Diana through psychic in his memoir 'Spare',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/prince-harry-reveals-contacting-late-mother-princess-diana-through-psychic-in-his-memoir-spare/articleshow/117667098.cms,"File photo: Princess Diana with young William and Harry (Picture credit: X)

Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic. In his memoir, Spare, the Duke of Sussex talks about reaching out to a medium with supernatural abilities to communicate with Diana, who passed away in a car accident in Paris in 1997, just before his 13th birthday, The Mirror reported.The Duke received a message from his mother through the psychic, who told him, ""You're living the life she wanted for you."" Harry, now 40, says that the medium also told him his mother was with him ""right now,"" which made his neck warm and his eyes fill with tears. The psychic shared that Diana knew Harry was ""looking for clarity"" and ""feels your confusion."" She added that Diana understood Harry had ""so many questions"" and that answers would come in time.Another anecdote involved Prince Harry’s son, Archie. The psychic reportedly described how Diana’s spirit witnessed Archie accidentally breaking a Christmas tree ornament shaped like Queen Elizabeth. When asked, Harry admitted the incident had occurred, adding that Archie had attempted to fix the ornament.The medium suggested Diana found humour in the situation, delighting in the antics of her grandson she never had the chance to meet.In Spare, Prince Harry also recounts an extraordinary encounter with a leopard during a trip to Botswana with his brother, Prince William. He interpreted the animal’s presence as a comforting sign from his late mother, suggesting that ""everything will be fine."" However, the experience was not without fear, as he briefly worried the leopard might attack.Harry has been candid about the psychological toll of losing Diana so young. As reported by The Mirror, he disclosed a haunting period after her death when he entertained the possibility that she had staged her demise. His anguish led him to repeatedly drive through the Paris tunnel where Diana’s life was cut short, attempting to make sense of the tragedy.","Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic.

Her post, titled ""attention, all men: Never hide a proposal ring in food!"" quickly gained traction, entertaining thousands.Liu recounted that after arriving home hungry one evening, she eagerly devoured a taro and meat floss cake her boyfriend had prepared. ""The cake was covered with a thick layer of meat floss, so I was just chewing it until I bit into something hard. I immediately spat it out,"" she explained.Initially assuming it was a bad quality, Liu prepared to complain to the bakery.

After wiping it clean, he revealed, ""Honey, I think this might be the ring I was going to propose to you with.""Caught off guard, Liu thought he was joking but soon realised it was indeed a gold ring.

Known as the ""hunchback"" minaret, it earned its name due to its leaning shape.Unesco spearheaded the restoration of this architectural marvel, which stands as part of the Al-Nuri Mosque , utilising original brickwork in the reconstruction process.Abdullah Mahmoud from Iraq's antiquities department expressed the significance: ""Al-Hadba is our identity, and restoring it means the city has reclaimed its identity"". The 12th-century structure maintains its distinctive 160-centimetre lean, identical to its tilt in the 1960.The Al-Nuri Mosque, where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed his self-styled caliphate in July 2014, was razed in June 2017 during Mosul's liberation battle. Iraqi officials stated that IS forces planted explosives before withdrawing.The five-year Unesco restoration incorporated 26,000 original bricks for the exterior, with 96,000 new bricks added internally for structural support. The foundation received additional reinforcement to stabilise the tilt.The restoration effort extended to the mosque's columns, dome and courtyard. The mihrab was restored using original stonework, whilst the minbar required substantial reconstruction due to missing original components.Former muezzin Imad Zaki observes the restoration daily, stating: ""Every day I stand here for an hour to watch as they are restored to their original state. Today one can feel the spirituality. It's as if our souls have finally found peace.""Unesco's broader restoration initiative includes the Al-Tahira Church from 1862, featuring reconstructed arcades, pillars and stained-glass windows. Archaeological discoveries include an underground cellar and wine vessels, now displayed beneath glass flooring.Unesco Iraq's senior project manager Maria Acetoso noted the transformation: ""When I arrived here in 2019, it looked like a ghost city. In five years plus, there has been a massive change.""Despite progress, Mosul's recovery continues. The clearance of 12,000 tonnes of debris was necessary for landmark restoration, whilst numerous neighbourhoods remain damaged.In the Old City, buildings marked 'safe' in red indicate explosive clearance. Many former inhabitants, particularly Christians, await return.Mohammed Kassem, now residing in a new dwelling, believes the city requires further reconstruction and the return of its original residents, particularly the Christian community.Saad Mohammed, 65, residing opposite Al-Nuri Mosque, recounts the IS period: ""We opened the window once and saw the black IS flag on top of the minaret. Then we opened it again, and the minaret was gone."" Now, with restored landmarks, he remarks, ""Today the minaret has risen again.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

New NPS rule from April 1 : The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has enhanced National Pension System (NPS) security by adding a new layer called two-factor Aadhaar authentication . Starting April 1, all users logging into the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) system with passwords must use this feature, as per the PFRDA circular dated March 15, 2024.According to ET, using two-factor authentication greatly lowers the risk of unauthorised access to the CRA system . This added layer ensures the safety of NPS transactions and protects the interests of subscribers and stakeholders.The login process for NPS CRAs is changing. Following the circular, Aadhaar-based authentication will now be combined with the current user ID and password login system. This update enables access to the NPS central record-keeping agency (CRA) system through two-factor authentication.Here's how to log in to NPS using 2-factor authentication:1. Visit the NPS website: https://enps.nsdl.com/eNPS/NationalPensionSystem.html2. Click on 'Login with PRAIN/IPIN.'3. Select the PRAIN/IPIN tab, and a new window will open.4.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

How does Microsoft’s scareware blocker work

Microsoft has started to roll out a new feature in its Edge browser called “scareware blocker” to protect users from increasingly sophisticated online scams, particularly those employing scareware tactics . The company announced the feature at its Ignite conference last November and is now inviting users to preview and test it.Scareware scams employ aggressive web pages designed to deceive users into believing their system is infected with malware. These scams often pressure victims to call fake tech support numbers, potentially leading to financial loss and compromised personal information.Microsoft says that its data revealed a significant rise in online scams, with Edge blocking five times more scams in 2024 compared to just three years prior. While Edge currently utilizes Microsoft Defender SmartScreen to block known scams, the new scareware blocker aims to provide a proactive defense against emerging threats.Microsoft says that its scareware blocker leverages a machine learning model to identify the characteristics of scareware scams and empowers users to regain control of their browsing experience.“Scareware blocker adds a new, first line of defense to help protect the users exposed to a new scam if it attempts to open a full screen page. Scareware blocker uses a machine learning model that runs on the local computer. The model uses computer vision to compare full screen pages to thousands of sample scams that the scam-fighting community shared with us. The model runs locally, without saving or sending images to the cloud,” Microsoft said.Users can then choose to report the malicious site to Microsoft, contributing to the improvement of Defender SmartScreen's ability to detect and block similar scams across the web. Users can also report false positives, helping to refine the scareware blocker's accuracy and reduce the likelihood of legitimate pages being mistakenly blocked.","Microsoft has started to roll out a new feature in its Edge browser called “scareware blocker” The feature aims to protect users from increasingly sophisticated online scams.

“The DeepSeek iOS app globally disables App Transport Security (ATS) which is an iOS platform-level protection that prevents sensitive data from being sent over unencrypted channels. Since this protection is disabled, the app can (and does) send unencrypted data over the internet,”

“While none of this data taken separately is highly risky, the aggregation of many data points over time quickly leads to easily identifying individuals. The recent data breach of Gravy Analytics demonstrates this data is actively being collected at scale and can effectively de-anonymize millions of individuals,”

“The encryption algorithm chosen for this part of the application leverages a known broken encryption algorithm (3DES) which makes it a poor choice to protect the confidentiality of data,”

“[A sample user] is operating on the latest iPad, leveraging a cellular data connection that is registered to FirstNet (American public safety broadband network operator) and ostensibly the user would be considered a high value target for espionage. Bear in mind that not only are 10’s of data points collected in the DeepSeek iOS app but related data is collected from millions of apps and can be easily purchased, combined and then correlated to quickly de-anonymise users,”

The DeepSeek app has been popular among iPhone users since its launch and even topped the App Store charts in the US. However, a mobile security company has discovered multiple new security vulnerabilities in the app offered by the Chinese AI startup. These flaws are considered more severe than a previous security issue that exposed chat history and sensitive data due to a lack of database authentication. However, the company didn’t fully disclose the extent of the new vulnerabilities and their potential impact.The security flaws in DeepSeek’s iPhone app were discovered by the mobile security company NowSecure. One of the vulnerabilities includes the lack of Apple’s built-in App Transport Security (ATS). ATS is meant to protect sensitive personal data by ensuring it is transmitted only over encrypted channels. The company claims to have discovered that DeepSeek had disabled this feature on its iPhone app.NowSecure said in a blog post.The company said that even though the exposed data may seem harmless, it can be easily combined to reveal a user's identity.the company added.NowSecure also noted that even though DeepSeek does encrypt data, it uses an outdated method that is known to have security flaws.the company continued.Moreover, the company also said that the data gathered by DeepSeek’s iPhone app can help identify potential targets for spying.the company explained.",The DeepSeek app has been popular among iPhone users since its launch and even topped the App Store charts in the US.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes the cost of inference will come down which will make it easier for companies to be able to infuse all their applications with inference and with generative AI.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it

The New York Times made history on February 15, 1942, by publishing its first crossword puzzle in the Sunday Magazine. Created by Charles Erlenkotter and edited by Margaret Farrar, this marked the paper as the first major U.S. publication to feature a crossword. The decision sparked a cultural shift, making puzzles a beloved pastime for readers. Over the decades, the NYT has expanded its puzzle offerings to include the Mini Crossword (2014) and popular games such as Spelling Bee, Letter Boxed, and Tiles. In 2022, the paper acquired Wordle, which became a global sensation. Building on this momentum, it later introduced games like Connections and Strands, capturing the interest of a growing community of players worldwide. The NYT continues to innovate in the puzzle space, cementing its position as a leader in engaging, mind-challenging entertainment for people of all ages and backgrounds, uniting puzzle enthusiasts across the globe.Having trouble solving today’s NYT Strands puzzle?

This expansion comes at a time when traditional TV providers are increasing prices, and streaming services are becoming more expensive, making FAST channels an attractive alternative for cost-conscious consumers.Virgin Media customers using Stream, V6, and Virgin TV 360 boxes will be able to access these new channels directly through their TV guide. The move reflects the growing popularity of reality TV and quiz-based content, as well as the increasing demand for free and easily accessible entertainment options.Virgin Media has assigned channel number 233 to Hell’s Kitchen and channel number 253 to Eggheads, making it easy for fans to tune in.The introduction of these dedicated reality TV channels is part of Virgin Media’s broader FAST channel strategy, which aims to provide cost-effective entertainment solutions to viewers. Unlike traditional cable or premium streaming services, FAST channels are delivered over the internet and supported by advertising, making them a free alternative to paid subscriptions.Virgin Media has previously introduced over 30 FAST channels, featuring content from popular shows such as Tipping Point and Deal or No Deal. The integration of these channels into Virgin TV’s program guide makes them more accessible compared to app-based streaming services, where users often need to search for content manually.The launch of new FAST channels coincides with rising television and streaming service costs across the UK.At the same time, traditional broadcasters are losing key channels, as seen with Eurosport’s recent announcement to exit the UK market after 35 years. These factors have driven a shift towards free, ad-supported TV, making FAST channels an increasingly attractive option for budget-conscious viewers.Virgin Media sees the expansion of its FAST channel lineup as a way to provide more value to its customers. David Bouchier, Chief TV and Entertainment Officer at Virgin Media O2, emphasized the growing importance of free streaming content in the current media landscape.""Reality TV doesn’t just entertain us but also tests our knowledge, gives us conversation starters, and most importantly, brings TV fans together,"" Bouchier stated.""The expansion of our streaming channel offering is brilliant news for our customers. With some of the most recognizable reality content available, our viewers can sit back, relax, and enjoy extra value— and extra drama—on us.""The Hell’s Kitchen and Eggheads channels are available to all Virgin Media TV customers with Stream, V6, or Virgin TV 360 set-top boxes. Unlike many streaming services that require separate apps, these channels are integrated directly into Virgin TV’s electronic program guide, making them as easy to access as traditional cable channels.For customers looking to explore more free content options, Virgin Media’s growing FAST channel lineup provides an alternative to costly subscription services, ensuring that viewers have access to quality entertainment without additional fees.","Virgin Media launches dedicated channels for Hell’s Kitchen and Eggheads. Fans can now enjoy continuous episodes without having to switch platforms or rely on streaming services. Virgin Media customers using Stream, V6, and Virgin TV 360 boxes will be able to access these new channels directly through their TV guide.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118013030,imgsize-27500,width-400,resizemode-4/118013030.jpg"

United States planning this ‘Tiktok-type’ action on China’s DeepSeek AI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/united-states-planning-this-tiktok-type-action-on-chinas-deepseek-ai/articleshow/118000343.cms,"US lawmakers are preparing to introduce legislation that would prohibit Chinese AI company’s chatbot, named, DeepSeek, on government devices, responding to escalating national security concerns about potential data collection risks. The proposed bill, crafted by bipartisan representatives Darin LaHood (Republican) and Josh Gottheimer (Democratic), aims to prevent what lawmakers see as a potential information security threat.The Wall Street Journal reported that the legislative move is driven by similar national security considerations that led to the ban of TikTok last year. ""This should be a no-brainer in terms of actions we should take immediately to prevent our enemy from getting information from our government,"" Gottheimer emphasized.Despite the mounting challenges, DeepSeek continues to gain popularity. The app's rapid rise has been remarkable, becoming the most downloaded app in America and boasting an open-source model that has been widely embraced by consumers and businesses. However, its Chinese origins have triggered scrutiny, with US government agencies like the Navy and NASA already restricting its use.Asides Navy and NASA, Texas became the first US state to block the AI application on government devices, with Governor Greg Abbott stating, ""Texas will not allow the Chinese Communist Party to infiltrate our state's critical infrastructure through data-harvesting AI and social media apps.""Cybersecurity experts have raised significant concerns about the app's data practices. Ivan Tsarynny, CEO of Feroot Security, as quoted in the WSJ, suggests that DeepSeek has intentionally hidden code that could transmit user login information to China Mobile, a state-owned telecommunications company prohibited from operating in the US.","US lawmakers are preparing to introduce legislation that would prohibit Chinese AI company’s chatbot, named, DeepSeek, on government devices.

ByteDance OmniHuman-1 sample

What ByteDance researchers said about OmniHuman-1



TikTok parent ByteDance has developed a new AI model called OmniHuman-1 . The latest model can generate realistic videos from photos and sound bites. This comes after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI expanded access to its video-generation tool, Sora, making it available to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users in December 2024. Last year, Google DeepMind also announced its Veo model which can create “high-quality, high-definition videos based on text or image prompts in a wide range of cinematic and visual styles with exceptional speed.” However, both OpenAI and Google's models that turn photos into videos are still not available to the public.In a paper (seen by the South China Morning Post), the ByteDance team behind OmniHuman-1 claimed that the multimodal model excels at creating videos of people speaking, singing, and moving with a quality “significantly outperforming existing audio-conditioned human video-generation methods”. While OmniHuman-1 has not yet been publicly released, sample videos have generated significant buzz online. One of the demo videos shows a 23-second clip of Albert Einstein giving a speech that was shared on YouTube.In a recently published technical paper, ByteDance researchers Lin Gaojie, Jiang Jianwen, Yang Jiaqi, Zheng Zerong, and Liang Chao introduced a new training strategy that integrates diverse datasets of text, audio and movement to enhance video-generation models. With this approach, the company aims to tackle challenges faced by global researchers in scaling such models.ByteDance also claimed that its method advances conventional video generation without directly naming competing AI tools. The researchers highlighted that their data-mixing approach allows for realistic video generation across various aspect ratios and body proportions, ranging from close-up facial shots to full-body visuals.The generated clips exhibit detailed facial expressions synchronised with audio, along with natural head and gesture movements, potentially enabling broader real-world applications.Among the sample videos released, one features a man delivering a TED Talk-style speech with lifelike hand gestures and synchronised lip movements, making it nearly indistinguishable from a real recording, the report adds.",TikTok parent ByteDance has developed a new AI model called OmniHuman-1.

AI researchers develop 'reasoning' model for under $50 like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-researchers-develop-reasoning-model-for-under-50-like-openais-o1-and-deepseeks-r1/articleshow/117986776.cms,"How researchers developed reasoning model

A team of AI researchers from Stanford University and the University of Washington have achieved a breakthrough in AI development by training a sophisticated “reasoning” model for less than $50 in cloud compute credits. Researchers used AI models by Google, Alibaba to create a chatbot with reasoning level as good as the ChatGPT-maker OpenAI ’s o1 LLMs.The model, named s1, is claimed to exhibit performance comparable to cutting-edge reasoning models like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1 on tests evaluating math and coding abilities. The s1 model , along with the data and code used in its training, has been made available on GitHub.The researchers behind s1 said that they utilised a readily available base model and refined it through a process known as distillation – a technique that involves extracting the “reasoning” capabilities from another AI model by training s1 on its answers.The researchers claim that their model s1 has been distilled from Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model. This approach mirrors the method used by Berkeley researchers who created an AI reasoning model for around $450 last month.The researchers behind s1 aimed to identify the simplest approach to achieve strong reasoning performance and ""test-time scaling,"" which allows an AI model to deliberate more before generating a response.“Test-time scaling is a promising new approach to language modeling that uses extra test-time compute to improve performance,” the researchers said in their paper published last week (via TechCrunch), adding that they “seek the simplest approach to achieve test-time scaling and strong reasoning performance.”The s1 research suggests that reasoning models can be effectively distilled using a relatively small dataset and a process called supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where an AI model is explicitly trained to mimic specific behaviors in the dataset.“First, we curate a small dataset s1K of 1,000 questions paired with reasoning traces relying on three criteria we validate through ablations: difficulty, diversity, and quality. Second, we develop budget forcing to control test-time compute by forcefully terminating the model’s thinking process or lengthening it by appending “Wait” multiple times to the model’s generation when it tries to end. This can lead the model to doublecheck its answer, often fixing incorrect reasoning steps,” the researchers said.","Researchers from Stanford University and the University of Washington have created a sophisticated reasoning model for less than $50 in cloud compute credits.
