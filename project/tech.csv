Kylie Kelce’s Strict Parenting Rule: Why Her Kids Are Banned from Phones



Kylie on Embarrassing Vegas Nights, Flip-Flop Aversions & Bikini Skiing with Chelsea Handler | Ep 12

Kylie Kelce , wife of former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce , has been making waves with her popular podcast Not Gonna Lie with Kylie Kelce, where she openly shares her experiences as a mother. With three daughters—Wyatt, Ellie, and Bennett—already part of the Kelce household and a fourth child on the way, Kylie has implemented a strict rule when it comes to technology: her children are not allowed to use or own phones.In the latest episode of her podcast, Kylie Kelce explained how she ensures her children grow up with a balanced approach to technology. While she does allow them to watch shows on tablets, smartphones are completely off-limits.“They are not allowed to touch phones,” Kylie stated. “That has been a rule from the very beginning. Occasionally, they will borrow someone’s phone and take pictures. Wyatt is really into taking selfies right now. Dad’s really thrilled about that one.”The Kelce household operates with a structured approach to screen time. Kylie admitted that while her daughters do watch content on tablets, she cleverly manages their usage. “I will pretend that I set a timer and I will tell them, ‘One more,’” she shared. “If my task that I was trying to complete is not finished, I will say, ‘You guys were so well behaved, I’ll let you watch one more.’”This strategy allows her to control their exposure while ensuring they remain engaged in other aspects of childhood beyond screens.Kylie has never shied away from discussing the real challenges of motherhood. On the January 23rd episode of her podcast, she described raising children as the “most selfless” and “all-encompassing” thing a person can do.""At any point in the day, you do have to always be concerned about the tiny humans you're responsible for, but I think there is a misconception that it wipes out the rest of you and makes you solely mom,"" Kylie explained.She further emphasized the importance of maintaining individuality while embracing motherhood. ""Whereas what we need to do is tack it on to the end of the resume and keep the rest of the s--- that also defines us as who we are as people because we're still us,"" she continued. ""Just because we made a human being or we are a mother to a tiny human doesn't mean that we are only mom.""Kylie Kelce’s Not Gonna Lie podcast has rapidly grown in popularity, reaching No. 1 on some platforms and amassing over 290,000 YouTube subscribers. Many of her episodes garner six-digit viewership, solidifying her presence in media.Meanwhile, Jason Kelce has also built a successful career post-football, co-hosting the New Heights podcast with his brother, Kansas City Chiefs TE Travis Kelce , as well as contributing to ESPN and other NFL coverage.Also Read: Caitlin Clark confidently names her all-time favorite NFL player – No second thoughts needed With their fourth child on the way, the Kelce household is about to get even busier.

Raze's Unique Look



The ONLY Raze Guide You'll EVER Need! - Valorant Agent Guide

Mastering Raze's Explosive Arsenal



Boom Bot (C): Deploys a small mechanical bot that hunts down enemies while bouncing off walls on its way. The bot explodes upon contact, dealing damage in a radius. An excellent asset for clearing tight areas and gathering crucial information about enemy positioning in areas that lack visibility.

Blast Pack (Q): A highly versatile ability, Blast Pack, sticks to surfaces when thrown and detonates on command. Damage can be done to enemies with the Blast Pack or, conversely, it can be a means of travel to move quickly away from danger or attack by surprise. In addition, Blast Pack can also be used anytime Raze needs to get into or out of a position quickly and to keep enemies guessing.

Paint Shells (E): Paint Shells are the cluster grenades that deal massive area damage that are pretty much Raze's bread and butter. Once thrown and activated, the grenade split into smaller grenades, thereby covering more ground. This ability works wonders in getting enemies from cover or denying entry into important choke points, rendering the opponents in a tighter situation.

Showstopper (X): Raze's ultimate ability is as explosive as it sounds. With a rocket launcher in her hands, Showstopper strikes, killing multiple enemies in one shot. This ultimate breaks through enemy defenses, flushes out entrenched enemies, or simply makes space for your team to push forward.

Former NBA Star Noah Vonleh in Hot Water Over $235,000 Debt: What Went Wrong?

NBA drama is spilling off the court and onto our timelines! Forget slam dunks and buzzer-beaters, we're talking digital dust-ups, legal battles, and enough social media spice to make your phone sizzle. Former lottery pick Noah Vonleh is throwing down accusations like alley-oops, but his former agency, Pensack Sports, is firing back with a legal full-court press.Vonleh, the well-traveled NBA veteran, has been on a social media tirade worthy of a reality TV show, blasting the Shanghai Sharks and Pensack Sports for allegedly stiffing him on his paycheck and treating him, shall we say, less than royally. Videos and fiery posts have painted a picture of mistreatment, leaving fans scratching their heads.But Pensack Sports isn't taking these accusations lying down. They've unleashed their legal team, led by attorney Mitch Schuster , who claims Vonleh is waging a ""malicious harassment, defamation, and extortion campaign."" According to Schuster, the real story is that Vonleh owes them a cool $235,000, a debt incurred after an arbitration ruling in the agency's favor for unpaid agent fees.""Mr. Vonleh did not appeal the decision after he lost and has yet to pay the amount owed,"" Schuster asserts. ""Since the ruling, in an effort to avoid his financial obligation, Mr. Vonleh has engaged in a malicious harassment, defamation, and extortion campaign in which he has made blatantly false accusations against Pensack Sports."" (via TMZ Sports Adding fuel to the fire, Pensack Sports alleges Vonleh even paid social media aggregators to amplify his side of the story, only for those posts to be yanked for spreading misinformation. Even the NBPA, the players' union, reportedly stepped in, but Vonleh has allegedly been less than cooperative.Now, the battle has escalated to federal court, with Pensack Sports aiming to collect what they believe they're owed. ""Despite the ongoing harassment, defamation, and extortion Mr. Vonleh has directed towards my client, Pensack Sports remains committed to resolving this matter through the proper legal channels,"" Schuster added.ALSO READ: Kevin Durant and Desmond Bane Nearly Come to Blows: Heated Confrontation Explained From a top draft pick to a social media sensation embroiled in a legal showdown, Vonleh's career has certainly taken some unexpected turns. Will the courts decide who's playing foul, or will this drama continue to unfold on our screens? Stay tuned, folks, because this game is far from over.","Former lottery pick Noah Vonleh is embroiled in a legal battle. His former agency, Pensack Sports, claims he owes them over $235,000.

Imagination Over Documentation: A Fresh Look at Dutch Art,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/imagination-over-documentation-a-fresh-look-at-dutch-art/articleshow/118836767.cms,"Laura Cummings Challenges 'Photographic' View of Dutch Paintings

Q:

How do you manage to write under the pressure of the standards you set for yourself?

A:

Q:

While I was reading your books, I kept thinking you're writing self-portraits, but in a sense, a self-portrait of you emerges as well, along with your parents. And it's a leisurely pace, as if one was walking through a museum.

A:

Q:

In your books you talk about the cultural and the socioeconomic context, and the lives that these individual artists lived. And you also do it in your analysis of artists who are women.

A:

Q:

What I marvel at is how your writing styles are so distinct in your three books that I've seen. And yet it's you.

A:

Listen here:Excerpts from the interview:I write about art during the week for my newspaper, The Observer, with what I think of as my right hand. I write about art for my books, art and life and the intersection between them, which is my special subject, with my left hand, if you like. My brain is playing split between these two worlds, between the professional commitments for my newspaper and then for book writing, which is where I feel a freedom and a comfort and a different kind of audience and a different kind of time scheme. And one is able to tell stories at length about painters and life and culture, and, in my case, in the new book, about sudden death and accidents and my father, who flew planes in India, in fact, in the Second World War.The way you describe that perfectly goes to my experience of museums and of looking at art, which all of the people listening will know, which is that when you're in a museum, you miss paintings. There are crowds in front of paintings. There are paintings that you feel are very particularly yours because you found them and you're alone looking at them. And I think of museums as being almost like cities where people walk and they see other people. In the case of artworks, I'm thinking of them as having a kind of personality. I feel that museums are like the places that we live. And they're not very different to me, in my mind. And all of the books that I have written do have moments I've described in the current book 'Thunderclap. They are moments where a person, particularly painters, see a work of art and there's a huge moment, and the feeling that you are seeing something really radically connected to you and only to you, and everybody has a different experience of everything. All of my books are arguing the same thing, which is that the human relationship with art is entirely personal.I always feel that I'm a bit mutinous, about art historians, because with regard to Dutch art, and this very much goes to women painting in the mid century, in the 17th century, we're always being told what to see, what to think. This is a symbol. Here is a skull. It must be about death. Here's a piece of cheese, maybe that's about death… Dutch art is very particularly supposedly full of these, you know, warnings against mortality and vanity and so on, but they really aren't. So one argument about Dutch art is that it's all symbolic. And I think, no, they're not. They're about the incredible beauty of the world and the amazing way that light gives its grace to everything that we look at around us and so on. And they're about the wonder of art, and they're not about something very simple. And. And what is always said about Dutch art, and I think completely wrongly, is that it's a sequence of photographs. And it's so democratic, it's so all embracing, and it's so infinite in its reach through everything that you can see. Everything is imagined, remarked upon, remembered, felt and painted by the artists.I can't paint and I can't sculpt. And I'm terrible at taking photographs, but I appreciate them enormously. So the only thing I have is words because I can't draw. And if I could draw, maybe I would be making art. But as it is, I have the thing I have which is just words and practice with words and so on. So I'm putting words to images and things that I want to praise and things that I want the viewer to see. And it arrives out of the fact that I couldn't be an artist because I had no talent.","Laura Cummings has written three books about Dutch art. She says the human relationship with art is entirely personal. Cummings: 'I can't paint and I can't sculpt. I'm terrible photographs, but I appreciate them enormously. And if I could draw, maybe I would be art'","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118836720,imgsize-23022,width-400,resizemode-4/118836720.jpg"

One admirer wrote, ""Can we take a moment for 11-year-old Prince George's drawing of his mum, the Princess of Wales?"" while another noted, ""It's wonderful! Impressed! Artistic genes in the family for sure!""Another fan enthused, ""To capture the essence of the subject in a sketch is a special gift. Very honestly inherited.""Meanwhile, Prince Louis and Princess Charlotte's contributions brought a colourful touch to the showcase, created with crayons, colouring pencils, and felt-tip pens.One user on X shared their appreciation, writing, ""They got it from their mummy!"" while another said, ""Such a lovely activity!"" Others commended the initiative, calling it ""a fantastic way to encourage creativity and self-expression.""The Princess of Wales, who studied History of Art at St Andrews University, has long been a passionate advocate for the arts. Since 2012, she has served as the patron of the National Portrait Gallery . Earlier this month, she attended the launch of The Bobeam Tree Trail at the gallery, an interactive exhibit designed to help children develop social and emotional skills through artistic engagement.","The Princess of Wales shared a line-drawn portrait of her son, Prince George, on social media.

Mikey Madison won the best actress prize for Brooklyn tragicomedy “Anora.”“Conclave,” which stars Ralph Fiennes as a cardinal corralling conniving clergy as they elect a new pope, beat “The Brutalist,” “Emilia Pérez,” Bob Dylan biopic “ A Complete Unknown "" to the top prize. ""Conclave” was also named outstanding British film and took trophies for editing and adapted screenplay.Supporting performer prizes went to Kieran Culkin for “A Real Pain” and Zoe Saldaña for “Emilia Pérez,"" which also won the award for best film not in the English language.Saldaña won for her role as a lawyer who helps the title character transition to a woman and out of a life of crime. She called the film “the creative challenge of a lifetime.”Best actress nominee Karla Sofía Gascón, who stars as the titular transgender ex-cartel boss in “Emilia Pérez,” wasn’t at the ceremony. Gascón has withdrawn from promoting the film, which has 13 Oscar nominations, amid controversy over her social media posts disparaging Muslims, George Floyd and diversity at the Oscars.Audiard has condemned those comments, but in his acceptance speech thanked Gascón and her co-stars Saldaña and Selena Gomez.“I am deeply proud of what we have all achieved together,"" he said.From the BAFTAs to the OscarsStars including Cynthia Erivo, Hugh Grant, Ariana Grande, Lupita Nyong’o, Timothée Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan walked the red carpet at London’s Royal Festival Hall for the awards, known as BAFTAs.The prizes will be watched for clues about who will triumph at Hollywood’s Academy Awards on March 2, in an unusually hard-to-call awards season.They also have a distinctly British accent. The ceremony kicked off with its kilt-wearing host, Scottish actor David Tennant, leading the audience in a rousing singalong of The Proclaimers’ anthem “I’m Gonna be (500 Miles).”Culkin's award came for “A Real Pain,” about odd couple cousins on a trip to explore their roots. The film's writer and co-star, Jesse Eisenberg, took the BAFTA for best original screenplay.“I’d like to share this with my wife, who didn’t come because she didn’t think I’d win,” Eisenberg quipped.“Anora,” about an exotic dancer entangled with a Russian oligarch's son, had been a best picture favorite after winning the top prizes last week at the Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards.“The Brutalist” had nine BAFTA nominations, while “Anora,” the sci-fi epic “Dune: Part Two” and musical “Wicked” hade seven each. “A Complete Unknown” and Irish-language hip-hop drama “Kneecap” received six nominations apiece.Brody won over stiff competition from Fiennes and Chalamet, who plays the young Dylan in “A Complete Unknown.” The other male actors nominated were Grant for his creepy role in the horror film “ Heretic,” Colman Domingo in real-life prison drama “ Sing Sing ” and Sebastian Stan for his portrayal of a young Donald Trump in “ The Apprentice.”Stan, who is also Oscar nominated, said it was “incredibly validating” to get recognition for the film, which initially struggled to find an American distributor. It's an origins story that focuses on Trump's relationship with ruthless power broker Roy Cohn, played by Jeremy Strong.“We were told this was going to be a thankless job that was never going to lead to anything,” Stan said, describing the movie as a “fair” depiction of the president.Best-actress nominees were Madison, Gascón, Demi Moore for body-horror film “ The Substance,” Ronan for “The Outrun,” Erivo for “Wicked” and Marianne Jean-Baptiste for the Mike Leigh drama “Hard Truths.” Erivo or Jean-Baptiste would have been the first non-white performer to win the leading actress BAFTA.Animated caper “Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl” won awards for best animated feature and best family and children’s film.Sci-fi epic “Dune: Part Two” won prizes for sound and visual effects. “The Brutalist” won for cinematography and musical score.

This year's winner was David Jonsson, star of high finance drama series “Industry” and London rom-com “Rye Lane.”“Star, I don’t know,” he said. “But rising, I guess.”“Willow” and “Return of the Jedi” actor Warwick Davis received the academy’s top honor, the BAFTA Fellowship, for his screen career and work to create a more inclusive film industry.He founded a talent agency for actors under 5 feet tall, because, he said, “short actors weren’t known for their talent, just their height.”BAFTA chairwoman Sara Putt sent a message of strength to everyone hit by last month’s devastating Los Angeles wildfires. Jamie Lee Curtis, a supporting actress nominee for “The Last Showgirl,” was absent because the fires delayed filming on her current work.The event was without a dash of royal glamour this year. Neither Prince William, who is honorary president of the British film academy, nor his wife Kate are attending.

Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

US President Donald Trump’s administration has launched a mobile app that is designed to facilitate what officials call “self-deportation” for immigrants living in the US without legal status. The government says that the app strengthens the country’s mission to “secure the border by ensuring lawful entry for travelers and supporting effective enforcement.”The application, named “CBP Home,” has been developed by US Customs and Border Protection and includes a ‘Report Departure’ feature allowing undocumented immigrants to indicate their ""intent to depart"" the country voluntarily.“The app provides illegal aliens in the US with a straightforward way to declare their intent to voluntarily depart, offering them the chance to leave before facing harsher consequences. This reinforces our commitment to enforcing US laws and safeguarding national security,” said Pete Flores, Acting Commissioner, US Customs and Border Protection.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem warned that “if they don't, we will find them, we will deport them, and they will never return.”The CBP Home App is available for download on Apple or Android devices as a free mobile application.With the CBP Home Mobile Application, travelers, businesses, and stakeholders will continue to gain access to a single digital solution that streamlines CBP processes, enhances security, and reduces administrative burdens – all from the convenience of a mobile device, CBP added.The new app replaces “CBP One,” which was launched during the Biden administration. The previous app allowed approximately one million migrants waiting in Mexico to schedule appointments to request entry at legal border crossings. Republican lawmakers had criticised this system, arguing it enabled mass migration without adequate vetting of applicants.President Trump terminated the CBP One program immediately after taking office, leaving many migrants with pending appointments uncertain about their status and next steps.The introduction of CBP Home aligns with other recent policy changes intended to pressure undocumented immigrants to leave the country. A forthcoming regulation, scheduled to take effect on April 11, will require individuals without legal status to register with the federal government or potentially face fines or imprisonment.","US Customs and Border Protection has launched a mobile app called 'CBP Home' The app allows undocumented immigrants to indicate their ""intent to depart"" the country voluntarily.

Foxconn , one of the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturers, has launched its inaugural large language model (LLM), “FoxBrain,” marking a significant step in the company's integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into its core operations.As per a report by news agency Reuters, the company plans to leverage FoxBrain to enhance efficiency in manufacturing and streamline supply chain management.FoxBrain was developed using 120 of Nvidia's H100 GPUs, completing the training process in approximately four weeks, the company said, adding that the model is built upon Facebook-parent Meta ’s Llama 3.1 architecture.Notably, FoxBrain is the first LLM in Taiwan specifically optimised for traditional Chinese and Taiwanese language styles, incorporating reasoning capabilities, the report said. Foxconn's internal testing indicates that while there is a minor performance difference compared to China's DeepSeek distillation model, FoxBrain's overall performance closely aligns with leading global standards, the company reportedly said.Initially, FoxBrain will be deployed for internal applications, encompassing data analysis, decision support, document collaboration, mathematical reasoning, problem-solving, and code generation. FFoxconn aims to expand the model's applications through collaborations with technology partners, sharing open-source information, and promoting AI adoption in manufacturing, supply chain management, and intelligent decision-making processes.Nvidia played a crucial role in the development of FoxBrain, providing support through its Taiwan-based supercomputer, “Taipei-1,” and offering technical consulting during the model's training phase. Taipei-1, the largest supercomputer in Taiwan, is owned and operated by Nvidia in Kaohsiung.Foxconn intends to provide further details about FoxBrain during Nvidia's upcoming GTC developer conference in mid-March.","FoxBrain is the first LLM in Taiwan specifically optimised for traditional Chinese and Taiwanese language styles.
