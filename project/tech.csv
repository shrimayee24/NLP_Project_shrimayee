Shannon Sharpe Lawsuit: Who is Gabriella Zuniga? The OnlyFans star who sued Shannon Sharpe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/who-is-gabriella-zuniga-the-onlyfans-star-who-sued-shannon-sharpe/articleshow/120578272.cms,"Source - X

Gabriella Zuniga: The woman rumored to be behind the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit



Who is Gabriella Zuniga? A young model with a quiet online past until now

For weeks, the $50 million civil lawsuit against Shannon Sharpe featured a mystery woman simply referred to as “Jane Doe.” But now, internet detectives and a few hip-hop gossip outlets believe they’ve uncovered who she is. Enter Gabbi Zuniga , a 20-year-old OnlyFans model whose name is suddenly at the center of one of the most talked-about legal cases in sports media.Here’s everything we know so far about Zuniga, where this information is coming from, and why the internet believes she’s the woman behind the allegations.The name Gabbi Zuniga first started trending on Twitter and TikTok shortly after news of the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit broke. According to viral posts from hip-hop accounts like WorldStarHipHop , OnSite, and The Neighborhood Talk, Zuniga is being identified as the woman suing Sharpe for rape, emotional abuse, and secretly recording intimate moments.Here’s why the internet believes Gabbi Zuniga is the woman suing Shannon Sharpe: The lawsuit never names the accuser, identifying her only as “Jane Doe,” but social media detectives quickly connected the dots. Screenshots of flirty DMs allegedly linked to Gabbi’s accounts began circulating, and old OnlyFans clips, TikToks, and deleted Instagram posts reportedly showed her in spaces resembling Sharpe’s home or hotel rooms described in the suit.Though the court documents still list the accuser as “Jane Doe”, these online receipts have pushed Gabbi’s name into the spotlight. No one has confirmed this yet, but screenshots of Gabbi’s alleged texts and DMs with Sharpe are circulating online and multiple Reddit and X (formerly Twitter) threads claim she was spotted with Sharpe in LA..Before this legal case, Gabbi Zuniga wasn’t a household name. She reportedly ran a modest OnlyFans account, occasionally posted on TikTok, and goes by the name of @sheiskarli on Instagram. Users claim she previously worked in LA as a fitness model and met Sharpe at a West Hollywood gym in 2023 when she was 20.Now, her name is trending across social media, with hundreds of users analyzing her posts and reposting alleged clips of her and Sharpe together.In civil lawsuits like this especially involving sexual assault—plaintiffs often use the name “Jane Doe” to protect their identity. It’s legal and standard practice. But once the story hits the internet, things can spiral.Gabbi hasn’t publicly confirmed or denied her involvement in the case, and her social media pages are now locked or deleted. Still, the viral naming has led to real-life implications, with online trolls, fans, and media digging into her private life.Sharpe’s legal team, meanwhile, is still treating the case as involving “Jane Doe,” and neither side has commented directly on Gabbi Zuniga by name.Whether or not the internet got it 100% right, the name Gabbi Zuniga is now tied to one of the most explosive sports lawsuits of 2025. From anonymous accuser to viral figure, her identity reveal (or alleged reveal) has added even more layers of drama and speculation to an already chaotic story.Also read - Inside the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit: A full timeline of the sexual assault case, lawyers, leaked videos, and what comes next","Gabriella Zuniga is a 20-year-old OnlyFans model.

"Aaron Rodgers: ""He looks miserable"": DK Metcalf appears unhappy in viral video as Steelers fans worry their $150M star already regrets joining the team",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/he-looks-miserable-dk-metcalf-appears-unhappy-in-viral-video-as-steelers-fans-worry-their-150m-star-already-regrets-joining-the-team/articleshow/120579454.cms,"Getty Images

The clip that started it all: DK Metcalf looked absolutely over it on day one in Pittsburgh

“get me out of here.”

Pittsburgh’s shaky QB situation might be the reason behind DK Metcalf’s somber energy

When the Steelers landed DK Metcalf in a blockbuster trade and locked him down with a five-year, $150 million deal in March, Pittsburgh fans were over the moon. But just a few weeks later, one viral video has flipped the mood completely. DK’s arrival at the team facility was meant to be a feel-good moment. Instead, his dead-serious face and low energy sparked a wave of memes, fan concern, and speculation that he’s already regretting the move.The video, posted by the Steelers' official X (formerly Twitter) account, was supposed to be a standard “Welcome to the squad” post. Instead, it showed DK Metcalf walking into the facility stone-faced, hands in pockets, barely looking up. No smile, no dap, no excitement. Fans were hyped when Pittsburgh signed DK Metcalf. But now, one video has everyone asking, does he even want to be here?It wasn’t just one or two comments, it was a flood of reactions all saying the same thing: Metcalf’s vibe screamedHere’s the real tea: while Metcalf is a Pro Bowl-level wide receiver, the Steelers still don’t have a solid quarterback to throw him the ball. At the moment, their QB room includes Mason Rudolph and Skylar Thompson, with the hope that the 2025 NFL Draft will add someone more promising.Fans expected a big-name vet, maybe even Aaron Rodgers but that hasn’t happened. And if you’re DK Metcalf, used to catching bombs from Russell Wilson and Geno Smith, this QB drop-off might feel like a nightmare.If the Steelers don’t fix their QB situation, this could become a full-on saga. But if Pittsburgh grabs a franchise quarterback in the draft or signs a vet late in free agency, it might be just the spark DK needs to feel fired up again.Also read - “Big black guy chokes small white woman”: Shannon Sharpe allegedly heard saying this in newly leaked audio clip"," DK Metcalf signed a five-year, $150 million deal with the Pittsburgh Steelers in March.

It’s riskier but rewarding.The best Spellswords are smart, strong, and tough.

Kevin Costner's Draft Day Scores Big on Netflix as NFL Draft Week Heats Up



Draft Day Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Kevin Costner, Jennifer Garner Movie HD

As the 2025 NFL Draft week unfolds, Kevin Costner’s 2014 sports drama Draft Day has unexpectedly surged back into the spotlight. Now trending on Netflix, the film has rekindled discussions about the intensity of draft-day decisions and the emotional stakes involved in professional football management. With the movie's return to streaming aligning perfectly with one of the NFL’s biggest annual events, its newfound relevance couldn't have come at a better time.At its core, Draft Day offers a dramatized peek into the whirlwind that surrounds the NFL Draft. Costner plays Sonny Weaver Jr., the fictional general manager of the Cleveland Browns, who finds himself navigating a maze of personal struggles and professional high-stakes gambles. The story unfolds over just 24 hours—a day that could define his career and change the trajectory of an entire franchise. The compressed timeline might defy the intricate, months-long preparations real NFL teams undertake, but it does an exceptional job of capturing the pressure-cooker environment that GMs endure.Though critics initially gave Draft Day a lukewarm reception—earning a 60% score on Rotten Tomatoes and a 6.8 on IMDb—the film has gradually built a dedicated fan base. While purists and insiders have called out some unrealistic elements, such as Sonny’s spur-of-the-moment draft decisions, fans have applauded the movie’s energy, tension, and compelling storytelling. The portrayal may not check every box for accuracy, but it resonates emotionally and delivers an engaging narrative that appeals to both hardcore football lovers and casual viewers.One of the movie's strongest points lies in its authentic flavor, thanks largely to the NFL's active involvement. With scenes shot during the real 2013 NFL Draft and appearances by actual players, coaches, and executives, the film achieves a level of realism that’s rare in sports dramas. The inclusion of familiar faces not only adds credibility but also makes for a delightful Easter egg hunt for fans. “Draft Day features a ton of cameos from real people in the football world,” a detail that has not gone unnoticed among viewers rediscovering the film on Netflix.Moreover, the all-star cast elevates the film's appeal. From Jennifer Garner and Denis Leary to Sam Elliott and the late Chadwick Boseman, the performances add gravitas and emotional weight. Each actor delivers with conviction, making the viewer feel the magnitude of every decision Sonny Weaver Jr. faces.In a sign of its growing cultural footprint, Draft Day is also being adapted into a television series—this time, set in the NBA. Produced by Lionsgate Television and LeBron James’ SpringHill Company, the upcoming series aims to shift the narrative into the world of basketball, offering viewers another look at the chaos and calculation behind professional drafts.While Draft Day may never fully escape criticism for its narrative liberties, its resurgence proves that it taps into something timeless—the passion, strategy, and drama that define professional sports. Its revival on Netflix during NFL Draft week only reinforces its place as a compelling sports drama that continues to stir conversation and capture hearts.Also Read: Shannon Sharpe’s NFL Draft appearance sparks outrage amid sexual assault lawsuit","Kevin Costner's 2014 sports drama Draft Day has unexpectedly surged back into the spotlight.

Google Gmail Update: Billions of Gmail users at Risk: Developer shares email that he says 'exploits vulnerability in Google’s infrastructure'; Google responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/billions-of-gmail-users-at-risk-developer-shares-email-that-he-says-exploits-vulnerability-in-googles-infrastructure-google-responds/articleshow/120562668.cms,"Google on hackers 'misusing' its infrastructure

Cybersecurity experts' safety tips for Gmail users

In a highly sophisticated phishing campaign, hackers are said to have successfully exploited Google’s infrastructure to send deceptive emails that appear to come from a legitimate Google address to trick users into handing over their login credentials. The attack, brought to light recently by Nick Johnson, lead developer of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), involved emails sent from no-reply@google.com that passed DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) authentication -- fooling Gmail into treating them as authentic security alerts.“These emails are valid, signed, and display no warnings in Gmail,” Johnson said on X (formerly Twitter). “They appear in the same thread as real Google security alerts, making them even more convincing.”The emails claim to notify recipients of a subpoena involving unspecified content from their Google Account and prompt users to click a sites.google.com link to “examine the case materials” or “submit a protest.” The link leads to a counterfeit Google Support page hosted on Google Sites, where users are asked to either “upload additional documents” or “view [the] case.” These buttons redirect to a near-perfect replica of the Google Account sign-in page—designed to harvest user credentials.“The only hint it’s a phishing attack is that it’s hosted on 'sites.google.com' instead of 'accounts.google.com',"" Johnson noted.Johnson warned that the realistic design and subtle domain differences make the phishing attempt especially dangerous. “These scams are designed to look as real as possible,” he said. “Users who don’t spot the slightly altered domain could risk identity theft or financial loss.”Google confirmed the attack and stated it has since closed the loophole that allowed the abuse. “We’re aware of this class of targeted attack from this threat actor and have rolled out protections to shut down this avenue for abuse,” a Google spokesperson told The Hacker News. “We encourage users to adopt two-factor authentication and passkeys for stronger protection.”The company reiterated that it never asks for account credentials -- including passwords, one-time codes (OTPs), or confirmation prompts -- via email or phone. Google also advised users to verify the authenticity of any email by opening links manually in a separate browser window. According to Google’s privacy policy, legitimate government requests for account information are accompanied by advance notice—unless legally prohibited.Cybersecurity experts caution Gmail users, particularly those not using two-factor authentication or passkeys, are at heightened risk. While passwords alone can be compromised, passkeys—hardware-bound login credentials—offer significantly stronger resistance to phishing.To avoid falling victim, users should be skeptical of emails that use vague greetings, urgent calls to action, or links requesting personal data.",Hackers are said to have successfully exploited Google’s infrastructure to send deceptive emails that appear to come from a legitimate Google address.

Most apps today have become unusable. They bombard users with irritating notifications, spam messages, and dark patterns, and many are downright scammy.

Without your knowledge, numerous apps on your phone track and harvest extensive data: which apps you've installed, how you use them, the content of your emails and SMS, media on your device, and more.

What's truly disturbing is that some apps track usage not just within their own environment but across other apps too. This means your most personal data is being harvested without your consent and sold to companies for shady targeting purposes.

Shannon Sharpe, the former NFL star and the ESPN host, has found himself in a huge scandal after a young woman accused him of sexually assaulting her on multiple occasions. The woman who is using a pseudonym in the media, Jane Doe, has alleged that the two met at a gym in 2023 and he has forced himself on her.

Now, fans have a different opinion on the whole situation.Jane Doe’s lawyer, Tony Buzbee, sent an audio file containing the recording of an alleged phone call between Shannon Sharpe and the woman to a bunch of media outlets.Recordings from the phone call revealed that the woman first asked the NFL legend if he would be mad in case she hung up. Shannon Sharpe confirms that he won’t be angry with her and “it is what it is.”When Jane Doe appears confused, Shannon Sharpe said, “Nothing. … You want to be a d*ck to me now, so…”To this, Jane Doe asks Shannon Sharpe to not “manipulate” her and Shannon Sharpe says, “Ah, lord have mercy. If you say that word one more time, I’m gonna f**king choke the sh*t out of you when I see you.”Now, Shannon Sharpe is being accused by Jane Doe’s attorneys that he has tried to “threaten” the young woman.

A fan wrote, “Too old to have been dealing with that girl in the first place”, while another joked, “I knew this 57 year old man was unserious when he had s*x via Instagram live.”A third fan wrote, “There’s no world where a man in his mid 50s should be sleeping with a 19 year old on the premise she’s ‘legal’ — oh Shannon Sharpe may your end on this plane come to an end.”Shannon Sharpe and his lawyers have denied all such claims of sexual harassment as fans remain divided about the whole situation.Also Read: ""Gonna f**king choke the sh*t out of you”: Shannon Sharpe's sexual assault scandal takes a new turn as leaked phone call sparks outrage","Shannon Sharpe’s leaked phone call with Jane Doe has confused fans as many feel it was “foreplay” rather than him “threatening” her.

What happened to Barron Trump? New photo raises questions as President's son looks 'plump and disheveled',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-happened-to-barron-trump-new-photo-raises-questions-as-presidents-son-looks-plump-and-disheveled/articleshow/120595354.cms,"Barron Trump is almost unrecognizable in the latest photo exclusively published by DailyMail.

Barron Trump's new photo has shocked those who have been following the closely guarded life of the President's youngest son as in the photos exclusively published by Daily Mail, Barron Trump looks different -- disheveled and somewhat plump in comparison to his usual sharp appearances. DailyMail described the look as 'pragmatic' as Barron was sporting a polo shirt and khakis when he was snapped on his way out of the New York University. He was looking more like his dad in his younger days, the report noted.The photos revealed that Barron Trump has changed his hairstyle and now wears it more naturally -- instead of his combed, polished look.Barron Trump is continuing his life in New York and not in Washington as he has his college to attend, though he does not have much of a social life in college. He is not allowed to give his phone number to anyone in the college and so he communicates with his friends via different gaming platforms, it was reported. Discord, Xbox are his outlets to reach out to his peeps, reports said. ""He has added it to his repertoire,"" a source told Page Six.""It's his communication platform of choice.""He can't give anyone his number to minimize the probability of his number getting leaked. ""If people get the number, they would give it out and then a million people would be calling non stop,"" the Page Six report cited one saying.

Is Trump taking Ozempic? Conspiracy theories swirl while mystery skin patch reappears on his hand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-trump-taking-ozempic-conspiracy-theories-swirl-while-mystery-skin-patch-reappears-on-his-hand/articleshow/120562463.cms,"Donald Trump's weight loss triggers speculations over Ozempic while the mystery greenish patch on his right hand reappears.

But what is the mysterious bruise?



Donald Trump's annual physical results have declared that he is in excellent health at the age of 78. His resting heart rate was recorded at 62 beats per minute and it was revealed that he takes two medicines for cholesterol control. His fitness was attributed to his active lifestyle as he has been regularly playing golf and winning -- even after becoming the president, his height was recorded as 75 inches (6 feet 2 inches) and his weight was 224 pounds (102 kg).Trump lost 20 pounds since his last presidential physical test in 2020 and the whispers are that a little pharmaceutical help was taken, Daily Beast reported. Elon Musk has been open about taking GLP-1 drugs to shed a few extra pounds but it will remain a secret whether Trump too used them. “Nothing would do more to improve the health, lifespan and quality of life for Americans than making GLP inhibitors super low cost to the public,” he posted on X. GLP-1 receptor agonists are used to treat diabetes and obesity, and include Ozempic and Wegovy.Dr Lisa Oldson, an obesity medicine specialist, told The Daily Beast she is doubtful a diet change alone could account for Trump’s distinctly slimmer look. “Most people don’t lose [weight] that fast without meds,” she said. “When we look at people losing 30 pounds, 40 pounds, 50 pounds, 80 pounds, 100 pounds,” Oldson said, “that’s much more often due to the newer meds, the GLP agonists,” and not because of diet and exercise alone.Though Trump is in the pink of his health, the mysterious bruise that appeared several times -- before, reappeared on Wednesday when the president held an impromptu press meet outside the White House. Trump was found to have some benign lesions, also known as actinic keratosis (AK), which are rough, scaly patches or bumps on the skin caused by long-term sun exposure.","Trump lost 20 pounds since his last presidential physical test in 2020 and the whispers are that a little pharmaceutical help was taken.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

A broader vision for ChatGPT

Challenges and considerations

Security and data privacy for in-chat purchases must meet stringent standards.

Merchant vetting and product curation would be essential to maintain quality control.

User interface design will need to accommodate commercial interactions without overwhelming the conversational experience.

OpenAI’s ChatGPT , widely known for its advanced conversational abilities and growing user base exceeding 800 million, may soon evolve from an informational assistant into an active e-commerce participant. According to recently uncovered, unreleased code discovered by, a new feature is in the works that could allow users to browse, compare, and purchase items from Shopify merchants directly within the ChatGPT interface.The update would allow for embedded pricing, user reviews, shipping details, and checkout—all without ever leaving the chat environment. If launched, this capability could dramatically shift the landscape of digital commerce by integrating AI-powered product recommendations with seamless transactions, positioning ChatGPT as both advisor and storefront.The potential integration centers on Shopify’s direct access within ChatGPT’s chat window, as per reports. Currently, when users ask ChatGPT for shopping recommendations—such as the best trail running shoes—the chatbot provides a list of options with links to external sites. The new feature described in the unreleased code takes this functionality further.According to the code findings, ChatGPT could soon display product cards directly within the conversation, offering detailed listings that include:Critically, the transaction process would be conducted entirely within ChatGPT, eliminating the need to redirect users to third-party websites.If deployed, this shopping feature would drastically streamline the customer journey. Rather than navigating through different retail websites, users would be able to:This represents a major departure from the traditional e-commerce model, reducing the number of steps between interest and conversion. For consumers, the benefit is in the convenience; for merchants, it’s in the exposure and sales potential.Shopify hosts millions of merchants, many of whom face significant challenges in driving traffic to their storefronts. Currently, small business owners often rely on:Integrating with ChatGPT could dramatically alter this dynamic. If Shopify listings are surfaced in direct response to product-related prompts, merchants could see significant increases in both visibility and conversion rates.The AI assistant's ability to recommend products based on user context and preferences offers sellers a unique opportunity: to place their offerings in front of highly targeted and ready-to-buy audiences.The move represents a significant step into what is increasingly being referred to as ""agentic commerce""—a future in which AI agents not only provide information but actively facilitate decisions and transactions on behalf of users.OpenAI is not alone in exploring this space:By embedding commerce within conversation, these platforms are transitioning from informational tools into full-fledged retail ecosystems.The Shopify integration also fits into a broader strategy by OpenAI to expand ChatGPT’s functional utility. Recent experiments with “Operator agents”—AI programs that can browse the web and perform tasks—indicate a long-term vision where ChatGPT becomes not just a recommendation engine but an action-oriented assistant.Until now, the platform's value was largely knowledge-based: helping users research topics, structure writing, or draft messages. This evolution into transaction execution represents a shift in both user expectations and technological capability.While promising, such a rollout would also raise several logistical and technical considerations:Furthermore, the impact on affiliate marketing, digital advertising, and retail logistics remains to be seen, as traditional models could be disrupted by this new method of product discovery and purchasing.","Shopify integration could revolutionise shopping experience.

How Nico Mueller secured the top spot

Andretti driver Nico Mueller and his race engineer Bertrand Mermine have surged to the top of the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard following a dramatic Miami Grand Prix, where post-race penalties reshuffled the final standings in Mueller’s favour. Though he originally crossed the line in 10th, Mueller was promoted to 4th, thanks to a well-timed strategy and a dash of late-race chaos. His calculated decision to split Attack Mode usage proved decisive, paying off when several drivers were hit with time penalties after the chequered flag.The Engineered to Outrun leaderboard celebrates the most dynamic driver-engineer duos in Formula E—tracking those who gain the most positions during a race, with emphasis on overtaking prowess, energy management, and overall race pace. The season concludes with an award for the top-ranked pairing.After Round 5 in Miami, the leaderboard has Maserati MSG Racing’s Stoffel Vandoorne and his race engineer Thibault Arnal on number 2. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries and race engineer Tom Bayles are in third position in the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard.The FIA Formula E Instagram account also shared the update, posting:“@nico.mueller51 overtaking his way up the rankings! With a mega drive from P18 to P4, the @andrettife driver tops the @abbgroup Engineered to Outrun leaderboard after Round 5. #MiamiEPrix #FormulaE #Motorsport #Racing.”Nico Mueller’s rise was the result of strategy combined with fortunate timing. While many drivers delayed activating Attack Mode until later in the race, Mueller opted for a more aggressive strategy—using two four-minute activations, starting with the first on Lap 11 to position himself within points range.By Lap 20, Mueller was running in 10th when a red flag was brought out following a three-car collision. After the restart, as the majority of the grid scrambled to use their remaining Attack Mode activations, Mueller’s earlier strategy gave him an edge.Despite finishing 10th on the road, he was ultimately classified 4th after multiple post-race penalties were issued. Drivers including Norman Nato, Robin Frijns, Oliver Rowland, Sam Bird, and Taylor Barnard were penalized 10 seconds each for misuse of Attack Mode, while Nick Cassidy received a five-second penalty for exceeding track limits.Also Read: Formula E Miami E-Prix 2025: Jake Hughes crashes at chicane, here’s how the multi-car collision changed the outcome.
