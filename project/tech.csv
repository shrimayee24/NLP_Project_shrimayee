iPhone 16 is ‚Äúillegal‚Äù in Inodnesia

Why the ban on iPhone 16

Indonesia has banned Apple 's iPhone 16 from being sold or operated in the country. Indonesia's Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita declared on Tuesday that any iPhone 16 operating in Indonesia is illegal, warning consumers against purchasing the device overseas.""If there is an iPhone 16 that can operate in Indonesia, that means that I can say, the device is illegal. Do report it to us,"" Kartasasmita stated, emphasising that no International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) certification has been issued for the device.The ban stems from Apple's unfulfilled investment commitments in Indonesia. The tech giant has invested 1.48 trillion rupiah ($95 million) of its promised 1.71 trillion rupiah, leaving a shortfall of 230 billion rupiah ($14.75 million).""We, the Ministry of Industry , are yet to be able to issue permits for the iPhone 16 because there are still commitments that Apple must realise,"" Kartasasmita explained at his office.Earlier this month, the minister had announced that ""Apple's iPhone 16 cannot be sold in Indonesia yet because the extension of the TKDN certification is still pending, awaiting further investment realisation from Apple.""The TKDN (Domestic Component Level) certification requires companies to meet a 40% local content value requirement to sell their products in Indonesia. The certification process is directly linked to Apple's commitment to establish research and development facilities, known as Apple Academies , in the country.The announcement comes despite Apple CEO Tim Cook 's April visit to Jakarta, where he discussed potential manufacturing plans with President Joko Widodo. Cook had indicated the company would ""look at"" the possibility of establishing manufacturing facilities in Indonesia.The iPhone 16, launched globally on September 20, remains unavailable in Indonesia, along with other new Apple products including the iPhone 16 Pro lineup and Apple Watch Series 10.Industry Ministry spokesperson Febri Hendri Antoni Arif confirmed that the TKDN certification application for iPhone 16 is under review but remains contingent on Apple fulfilling its investment commitments.","Indonesia has banned Apple's iPhone 16 from being sold or operated in the country.

Marriage apps in Pakistan challenge traditional 'rishta aunties',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/marriage-apps-in-pakistan-challenge-traditional-rishta-aunties/articleshow/114491653.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: Lexica AI)

In Pakistan, the traditional matchmaking system is facing competition from marriage apps specifically designed for Muslims. These apps are being adopted as an alternative to the longstanding tradition of using "" rishta aunties ,"" or matchmakers, who facilitate arranged marriages .Ezza Nawaz, a textile designer in Lahore, decided to try an app after witnessing a friend's successful marriage through an online introduction . ""When I saw my colleague happy after being married to someone she met online... I thought, since we have tried rishta aunties for four or five years, let's try this too,"" she told AFP. Nawaz married Waseem Akhtar just three months after meeting him on an app called Muzz.Traditionally, rishta aunties prepare women and present them to potential suitors' families in Pakistan, where dating is often seen as dishonorable. More than 80% of Pakistani marriages are arranged, according to a Gallup and Gilani Pakistan survey, with families taking the lead in deciding unions.Despite offering features like the option to blur profile pictures and providing message transcripts to a relative, marriage apps still face stigma, according to an AFP report. They are seen by some as comparable to casual dating apps like Tinder, which is banned in Pakistan.Waseem Akhtar, married to Nawaz, admits to being discreet when discussing their meeting. ""I do not tell people how I met my wife until I am sure that the person would not judge us,"" he said.In Pakistani culture, marriage is viewed as an alliance between families, and choosing a spouse independently is seen as challenging traditional structures. Rida Fatima, who used a rishta auntie, found the advice limiting and invasive. She was told to list ""cooking and cleaning"" as her hobbies instead of her interests like hiking and photography. ""They had the audacity to talk about how I looked, what I did, how much I earned, who my family is, how many brothers I have, and what my future aspirations are. So every little thing is judged,"" she said.Marriage apps continue to rise in popularity, with 1.2 million Pakistanis signing up since the launch of some apps last year, according to an AFP report. Despite this, traditional matchmaking remains strong, reflecting deep-rooted cultural practices . Matchmaker Fauzia Aazam dismisses marriage apps, stating, ""People waste time on these apps. Chatting together all through the night, I just don't like it.""Feminist author Aisha Sarwari points to control issues in the traditional matchmaking process and suggests a balanced approach. ""I would say that we need to find a good middle ground, where the respect is equal on both sides and there is no sense of demeaning a human being just because they look a certain way or they are from a particular race,"" she said.Aneela, a digital media artist, experienced different challenges on marriage apps. She found men lying on profiles and admitted to using fake details herself to avoid being identified. Eventually, she considered returning to arranged marriage options.","More than 80% of Pakistani marriages are arranged, according to a Gallup and Gilani Pakistan survey.

They cautioned that legitimate government URLs end in "".gov.au"" and warned that other URLs could be scams.The report suggested that the scam sites often feature a tool for ""checking eligibility,"" prompting users to enter personal details into a fake calculator. Scammers then exploit these credentials, sometimes locking users out of their accounts or filing fraudulent MyGov claims for funds.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, ‚ÄúTo do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Starting April 1, all users logging into the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) system with passwords must use this feature, as per the PFRDA circular dated March 15, 2024.According to ET, using two-factor authentication greatly lowers the risk of unauthorised access to the CRA system . This added layer ensures the safety of NPS transactions and protects the interests of subscribers and stakeholders.The login process for NPS CRAs is changing. Following the circular, Aadhaar-based authentication will now be combined with the current user ID and password login system. This update enables access to the NPS central record-keeping agency (CRA) system through two-factor authentication.Here's how to log in to NPS using 2-factor authentication:1. Visit the NPS website: https://enps.nsdl.com/eNPS/NationalPensionSystem.html2. Click on 'Login with PRAIN/IPIN.'3. Select the PRAIN/IPIN tab, and a new window will open.4. Enter your user ID and password.5. Complete the Captcha verification.6. A window will prompt for Aadhaar authentication and send an OTP.7. Enter the OTP received on your registered mobile number.8. Submit the OTP.To bolster security and protect the interests of subscribers and stakeholders, the CRA system will now use Aadhaar-based authentication for login. This authentication method will be integrated with the existing User ID and Password login system, enabling 2-factor authentication to access the CRA system.Government sector nodal offices can employ Aadhaar OTP for 2-factor authentication on the CRA and NPSCAN systems. To begin Aadhaar Mapping, the Oversight Office (PrAO/DTA) must initially link Aadhaar with the respective CRA User ID. PAO/DTOs must also link their Aadhaar with their CRA User ID to enable DDOs to initiate Aadhaar linkage.Government and autonomous bodies are required to implement Aadhaar-based login and authentication within the CRA system for NPS operations.","The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has enhanced National Pension System (NPS) security by adding a new layer.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

A one-hour video recording of a ""digital arrest"" scam has gone viral, offering a glimpse into the tactics employed by these fraudsters. The video, featuring a journalist targeted by the scammers, serves as a warning for the public to remain vigilant against such online threats.An investigative journalist from Gujarat posted a series of videos on X (formerly known as Twitter) to warn the people about digital arrest scam . Gamers received a WhatsApp call from scammers informing him that his phone number is being misused. ‚ÄúFirst I received a call from an unknown number informing me that my mobile numbers would be blocked in the next four hours as they were being used for harassment and financial fraud. Scammers make this call in the name of Telecom Regularity of India (TRAI),‚Äù posted Gamers.The caller asked Gajera to either reach the Lucknow police station within 12 hours or register his statement via WhatsApp video call. Gamers selected the second option and then a scammer, disguised as a police officer, appeared in a setting resembling a police station. Gajera astutely noted that this tactic is a common ploy used by scammers, as it's during the video call that victims are most likely to believe the legitimacy of the threat.The scammer, posing as a police officer, informed Gajera that his Aadhaar details and phone number had been misused in illegal activities. The scammer then attempted to manipulate Gajera into filing a complaint while keeping him on the line.The scammer falsely accused Gajera of being involved in 17 harassment cases. To further their deception, they shared a forged document purportedly issued by the Supreme Court and TRAI, naming Gajera as a suspect. ‚ÄúNext, he started to inquire about whether I use UPI apps or net banking so they can use this mode to transfer the amount. In the end, the scammer police officer gives this case to DCP. He informed me that I needed to transfer all the money I had in my bank accounts, which would be returned if I was found innocent, and they would give me a certificate!‚Äù added Gajera.For an hour and a half, Gajera was held captive in a virtual ""digital arrest,"" unable to terminate the call or leave his phone. He intentionally endured the ordeal to document the scam and share it online, aiming to alert others about this dangerous tactic.The video also explains that how the scammers employ a variety of tactics to create an air of legitimacy, including:* Fake Aadhaar card: The scammers display a fake Aadhaar card, a crucial Indian identity document, supposedly linked to a criminal case against the victim.* Forged legal documents: They brandish a fabricated letter purportedly from the Supreme Court, further escalating the perceived threat.* Misuse of symbols of authority: They wear a police uniform on camera and display the Indian flag in the background, attempting to project an aura of officialdom.","An investigative journalist from Gujarat posted a series of videos on X (formerly known as Twitter) to warn the people about digital arrest scam.

The company will employ ""private cloud compute"" only when additional processing power is necessary.""When you ask to summarise a long email, it's encrypted to a trusted device in the cloud that performs AI processing and returns the result. The important part is that Apple has no access to that email, and it's gone once the process is complete,"" Federighi explained. Apple CEO Tim Cook reinforced this strategic patience in a separate Journal interview, stating, ""Not first, but best."" Cook added, ""We weren't the first to do intelligence, but we've done it in a way that we think is the best for the customer.""The AI features , first showcased at WWDC 2024 and highlighted during the iPhone 16 launch, will debut later this month with iOS 18.1 .

But as a user, you're not quite sure‚Äîis that all they're going to do with it?""The software chief emphasised that Siri improvements will be gradual but significant. ""The great news is that Siri is useful today and has been for many people for years, but it's getting more and more useful,"" he noted, while cautioning, ""Is there going to be one moment where we say Siri is now my sentient pal?

‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to get in the ring with Pat. I don‚Äôt think he has the balls to, but that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs sticking to announcing now.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs probably jealous. He‚Äôs losing his hair and I‚Äôm gaining it over here,‚Äù
