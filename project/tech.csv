Gracie Hunt‚Äôs Denim shade steals spotlight with a sly dig at Sydney Sweeney



When fashion becomes a soft battlefield



Gracie Hunt is once again proving she doesn‚Äôt need a red carpet to set trends or spark conversations. The Kansas City Chiefs heiress and former Miss Kansas USA turned Instagram into her own runway this week, delivering a bold style statement paired with a sly remark that many believe was aimed squarely at actress Sydney Sweeney . Her fashion-forward post did more than just flaunt $288 denim‚Äîit lit up the internet with speculation and subtle shade.In a stunning carousel of sun-kissed images posted Wednesday, Gracie stood confidently in a sleek sleeveless black mock-neck top, high-waisted blue jeans, black Gucci belt, and sky-high platform heels. Accessories included a black handbag, layered gold jewelry, and that signature pageant-worthy poise. But what stole the spotlight wasn‚Äôt just her outfit‚Äîit was the caption beneath.‚ÄúDenim days & dreamy nights üíôüåÑ I like the view and my jeans (not American Eagle‚Äîbut they are American) üòâüëñüá∫üá∏,‚Äù she wrote.Fashion fans didn‚Äôt take long to connect the dots.

And your genes.. üíô‚Äù A perfectly layered compliment that fed into the post‚Äôs playful energy.Though Gracie Hunt has never been one to court Hollywood drama, this subtle fashion feud shows she knows how to use her platform with precision. Her blend of glam and grit continues to define her personal brand‚Äîwhether she‚Äôs posting from NFL sidelines or sandy Florida beaches, like she did recently with boyfriend Derek Green, son of former Chiefs QB Trent Green.As for Sweeney, she hasn‚Äôt responded to the apparent dig, staying busy with acting gigs and brand deals.

A medical facility's organ donation unit allegedly pressed for harvesting organs from a comatose patient, despite her showing signs of being responsive, according to healthcare staff.In 2022, Danella Gallegos, a 38-year-old unhoused individual, entered a comatose state. Medical professionals informed her family about the unlikelihood of her recovery.After her family consented to organ donation, they noticed tears forming in Danella's eyes during pre-operative procedures, as reported to The New York Times.Staff at Presbyterian Hospital in Albuquerque observed her responding to commands to blink her eyes, causing astonishment among the medical team.Reports suggest that New Mexico Donor Services representatives insisted on proceeding with the operation, dismissing the patient's responses as mere reflexes.The medical team refused to comply with the coordinator's request and cancelled the surgery. Subsequently, Danella achieved complete recovery.Danella has filed a complaint with the Department of Health and Human Services, telling The Times: ""I feel so fortunate.But it's also crazy to think how close things came to ending differently.""A Presbyterian Hospital intensive care nurse stated: ""All they care about is getting organs.""The donation organisation rejected the hospital staff's allegations, emphasising that coordinators do not influence medical decisions.Requests for response have been sent to New Mexico Donor Services and the Department of Health and Human Services.Current statistics show 103,200 individuals await organ transplants, with 13 daily fatalities during waiting.

Walls Closing In? Meghan Markle Faces Royal Cold Shoulder Amid New Fears: Reports

Different networks, same idea

Anderson‚Äôs calm response

What critics say about Markle‚Äôs show

Positive buzz for Anderson

No reaction from Meghan





Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series. The former Baywatch star spoke about the issue on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. When Cohen asked her to rate, on a scale of one to ten, how much Markle‚Äôs With Love, Meghan looked like her own Pamela‚Äôs Cooking With Love, Anderson answered ‚ÄúOne.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt invent cooking shows. She‚Äôs just doing her thing.‚ÄùFans noticed that both shows feature garden scenes, casual kitchen chats, and celebrity guests. Anderson‚Äôs trailer came out in October 2024. Markle‚Äôs teaser followed three months later. Online threads pointed to similar camera angles and even matching font styles in the titles. Some viewers accused the Duchess of releasing a ‚Äúframe-for-frame‚Äù copy.Pamela‚Äôs Cooking With Love is streamed on Amazon Prime. Episodes show Anderson and a guest chef picking vegetables in her Vancouver garden before cooking a meal outdoors. Markle‚Äôs eight-part Netflix show centres on simple dishes and home-grown produce in Montecito.Both series mix recipes with lifestyle tips, but Anderson stressed that overlap is normal in food television.Anderson told Cohen she had only seen quick clips of Markle‚Äôs programme and did not spend time looking for likenesses. She joked that there is room for anyone who wants to share food and stories on screen. Her relaxed tone cooled much of the online debate.With Love, Meghan drew mixed-to-negative reviews (‚âà38% on Rotten Tomatoes; 37 on Metacritic). It briefly entered Netflix‚Äôs Top 10 in its first week, and mid-year engagement tallies cited by several outlets place it outside Netflix‚Äôs Top 300. Even so, Netflix has ordered Season 2.Anderson‚Äôs series has earned strong notices and a high user score on IMDb. Executive producer Jesse Fawcett said any comparison is a compliment because it proves their team set a trend others want to follow. Anderson plans to film a second garden season next spring.Markle has not commented on Anderson‚Äôs remarks. Sources close to her say she is focused on shooting new episodes and expanding her As Ever lifestyle brand. Observers doubt she will address copy-cat talk directly. They note she has stayed silent through similar critiques from Martha Stewart and Gwyneth Paltrow.Two stars can host cooking shows without a feud. Anderson‚Äôs light answer suggests she sees no threat. Unless Markle fires back, the story may cool as fast as it boiled up.

Amsterdam‚Äôs beautiful canals can be dangerous for animals like cats; here‚Äôs why



How Amersfoort‚Äôs easy solution sparked change in Amsterdam



How the wildlife staircases will work to save trapped animals in Amsterdam‚Äôs canals



Design: Lightweight, durable wooden steps angled slightly upward, allowing even small creatures like hedgehogs to climb easily.

Placement: Focused on canal edges with high accident rates, such as residential areas where cats roam freely and near parks where ducks feed.

Durability: Built to withstand constant water exposure, algae buildup, and even winter freezing conditions.

Staircases built for animals could save human lives too

Amsterdam is famous for its postcard-perfect canals, historic bridges, and lively waterfronts‚Äîbut beneath this charm lies a silent danger for animals. Every year, pets and wildlife accidentally slip into the waterways, often unable to climb out because of steep canal walls. In 2025 alone, 19 cats drowned in these waters, sparking heartbreak among pet owners and outrage from animal lovers. Now, the city has taken a bold step: investing 100,000 Euros to install hundreds of tiny wooden staircases that serve as escape routes for cats, ducks, hedgehogs, and other small creatures as reported by Euronews. Inspired by a similar project in Amersfoort, these miniature life-saving ladders promise to make Amsterdam‚Äôs canals safer for both animals and humans while setting an example for cities worldwide.Amsterdam‚Äôs canals are undeniably beautiful, attracting millions of tourists each year. But for animals, these picturesque waterways can turn deadly. Cats, naturally curious and agile, often wander along the narrow canal edges or chase birds, only to lose their footing. While most cats can swim, their water-soaked fur weighs them down quickly, causing exhaustion and hypothermia within minutes.It‚Äôs not just cats; ducks, hedgehogs, and even urban foxes often end up trapped, unable to scale the smooth, vertical stone walls.For a small animal, these canals can feel like a moat with no escape. The result? Heartbreaking statistics and frantic rescue calls every year. By adding these staircases, Amsterdam is essentially building a bridge between urban living and animal safety, acknowledging that even in a busy modern city, every life matters.Amsterdam didn‚Äôt come up with this idea out of thin air‚Äîit‚Äôs inspired by Amersfoort, a smaller Dutch city, which in June 2025 installed 300 wildlife exit ladders along its waterways. These were simple but ingenious: wooden steps securely attached to canal walls, creating an easy ramp for animals to climb out, especially hedgehogs, ducks, and frogs often trapped during rising water levels.The results were immediate‚Äîfewer animal drownings, fewer emergency calls, and a happier local community. When Amsterdam‚Äôs pro-animal political party, PvdD (Party for the Animals), saw this success, they pushed for a similar plan. What makes this story even more interesting? The city already had 100,000 Euros sitting unused in its ‚Äúwildlife exit points‚Äù budget, originally intended for projects exactly like this. One council vote later, and Amsterdam‚Äôs canals were set to become a safer haven for animals.These staircases aren‚Äôt just random planks of wood‚Äîthey‚Äôre strategically designed and placed based on research by Dierenambulance (Animal Ambulance). This organisation, which handles thousands of animal rescue calls annually, knows exactly where animals most often fall into trouble.According to Maggie Ruitenberg from the Katten Kenniscentrum, even one well-placed staircase can save dozens of lives a year, especially when cats panic and lose precious minutes trying to find a way out.14 people die each year in Amsterdam‚Äôs canals, many of them tourists who accidentally fall in‚Äîoften under the influence of alcohol or drugs. While these staircases are primarily for animals, they could also provide unexpected life-saving options for humans.Some parts of Amsterdam already feature human-friendly ledges built during canal renovations, but adding more accessible points‚Äîeven if initially intended for animals‚Äîcreates more opportunities for anyone who slips into the water to save themselves. In this way, a project meant to save pets and wildlife could also make Amsterdam‚Äôs canals safer for everyone. In fact, Amsterdam may have just created a blueprint for other cities with waterways‚Äîfrom Venice to Bangkok‚Äîto adopt simple, wildlife-friendly infrastructure. In an era where urbanisation often pushes wildlife to the margins, these tiny staircases represent a big step towards compassion-driven city planning.","14 people die each year in Amsterdam‚Äôs canals, many of them tourists who accidentally fall in. Every year, pets and wildlife accidentally slip into the waterways, often unable to climb out because of steep canal walls. In 2025 alone, 19 cats drowned in these waters, sparking heartbreak among pet owners and outrage from animal lovers. The city has invested 100,000 Euros to install hundreds of tiny wooden staircases that serve as escape routes for cats, ducks, hedgehogs, and other small creatures.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123137619,imgsize-126024,width-400,resizemode-4/123137619.jpg"

More than 7,000 people have been infected with chikungunya, a mosquito-borne virus, in China‚Äôs Guangdong province since July.The outbreak has prompted strict containment measures similar to those used during the Covid-19 pandemic, reports BBC.Foshan, the epicenter of the outbreak, has implemented mandatory hospitalisation for confirmed patients, requiring them to remain in beds covered with mosquito nets. Patients are only discharged after a week or upon testing negative.The virus spreads through mosquito and causes fever and severe joint pain. The pain can last for months or even years.According to authorities, 12 other cities in Guangdong have reported cases, and nearly 3,000 new infections were recorded just last week. Hong Kong also reported its first case‚Äîa 12-year-old boy who had travelled to Foshan, BBC reported.Officials state that 95% of reported cases have been mild, with patients recovering in under a week.In response to the outbreak, the US has advised travelers to China to exercise ‚Äúincreased caution.‚ÄùLocal authorities have intensified mosquito control operations, urging residents to get rid of stagnant water and seek medical care if symptoms appear.Non-compliance can lead to fines of up to 10,000 yuan (around $1,400). Additionally, thousands of mosquito larvae-eating fish have been released in Foshan lakes, and drones and predatory ‚Äúelephant mosquitoes‚Äù are being used to locate and reduce breeding sites.The aggressive containment tactics have drawn comparisons to China's earlier pandemic protocols.Chikungunya symptoms typically appear 3 to 7 days after a bite and include fever, rash, muscle pain, and swollen joints. While most cases resolve in about a week, joint pain can persist, especially in vulnerable groups like infants, seniors, and people with underlying conditions. There is no cure, though fatalities are rare.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)","More than 7,000 people have been infected with chikungunya, a mosquito-borne virus, in China‚Äôs Guangdong province since July.

China witnessed a miracle when a boy, who is just three years old, miraculously survived an extraordinary 18-storey fall from his residential building, with a tree breaking his fall.The event occurred on July 15 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, southeastern China, while the young boy was under his grandparents' supervision, South China Morning Post reported.The grandparents had stepped out briefly to purchase groceries, believing the child was asleep. They secured the flat's door to ensure his safety.Upon waking, the child entered the bathroom, which had an unprotected window. He climbed onto the toilet and subsequently the window, from which he fell.A tree intercepted his fall, enabling his survival. His father later placed a large red flower on the tree in appreciation.A passing resident discovered him and recorded a video, sharing it with the property management.The father, Zhu, initially doubted the 18-storey fall until viewing surveillance footage. He explained that an open window on the 17th floor altered his son's falling path, directing him towards the tree that cushioned his landing.At the hospital, staff termed his survival miraculous. His injuries included a broken left arm, spinal strain and internal organ damage, though his head remained uninjured.Remarkably, the conscious child requested: ""Ask Daddy to buy me a Bumblebee.""Zhu presented a large red flower to the tree, a traditional Chinese symbol of honour. The incident sparked online discussions, with comments ranging from criticism of parental oversight to expressions of relief at the boy's survival.","Three-year-old boy falls from 18-storey building in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China.

"In Oman, white is law: Why can‚Äôt residents in Oman decide what colours their houses can be?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/in-oman-white-is-law-why-cant-residents-in-oman-decide-what-colours-their-houses-can-be/articleshow/123135325.cms,"Oman‚Äôs cityscapes, especially in Muscat are renowned for their uniform white and light-hued buildings/Image: Shutterstock

TL;DR:

Oman‚Äôs building regulations mandate that exterior building colours must be white or light shades (like ivory or beige) to preserve the country‚Äôs traditional architectural aesthetic and cultural heritage.





Any use of alternate or darker colours on building exteriors requires prior government approval through a formal application process with the municipality, ensuring urban harmony and adherence to environmental considerations.





The law also serves practical purposes by reflecting sunlight to reduce heat absorption, which aligns with climate considerations in Oman‚Äôs hot environment, and supports social and cultural cohesion by maintaining uniform cityscapes.



Historical and cultural roots

Preservation of National Identity: Omani cities place a strong emphasis on honoring traditional Islamic and Omani architectural styles. The predominance of white and its shades is intended to maintain continuity with local history, reinforce cultural identity, and protect the aesthetic coherence of urban landscapes

Architectural Heritage: The choice of white and light hues for exteriors dates back centuries, reflecting principles of Omani construction and Islamic design. The absence of skyscrapers and the preference for unified, modest colour palettes demonstrate a respect for peace, harmony, and traditional values.

Practical and environmental considerations

Climate Control: White and light-shaded surfaces reflect sunlight and absorb minimal heat, helping keep interiors cooler‚Äîa crucial benefit in Oman‚Äôs intensely hot climate. This not only improves living comfort but also reduces reliance on air conditioning and energy consumption

Sustainability: Building codes and municipal guidelines stress the sustainability of using such colours. They align with the local landscape and environmental requirements, ensuring both the well-being of residents and the resilience of Omani cities.

Legal framework and regulation

Mandatory Use of White and Light Colours: According to Muscat Municipality and official documentation, shades of white, including ivory, pearl, alabaster, and other variations are the only exterior paint colours that do not require special approval. Any proposal to use bolder or different hues must go through a formal application and accreditation process with the relevant municipality‚Äôs technical licensing department.

Application for Exceptions: Owners or contractors wishing to use non-white colours must submit an application (including samples and plans) to the municipality for assessment and approval. Recent years have seen minor relaxations, some areas now allow grey, beige, or light brown within local internal blocks but these are the exception and not the rule, aimed at maintaining overall visual harmony.

Urban aesthetics and social order

A Unified Urban Identity: The uniformity of colour serves to protect Muscat‚Äôs and Oman‚Äôs distinct architectural imprint. Community members and experts argue that this policy not only preserves tradition but also curbs ‚Äúvisual pollution‚Äù from inconsistent colour choices, ensuring an uncluttered, elegant cityscape.

Psychological and Social Impact: As described by local architects, the choice of building colour goes beyond decoration, it influences mood, perception, and social values by offering a calming, dignified visual experience tied to Omani customs.





Oman‚Äôs distinctive cityscapes, especially in capitals like Muscat, are renowned for their uniform white and light-hued buildings, a striking visual feature deeply rooted in the country‚Äôs cultural identity, climatic realities, and government regulations. This architectural tradition goes beyond mere aesthetics; it reflects a deliberate effort by the Omani authorities to preserve the nation‚Äôs heritage, harmonize urban environments, and provide practical benefits in the region‚Äôs intense heat.The Ministry of Regional Municipalities, Environment and Water Resources, along with local municipalities such as Muscat Municipality, have formalized these requirements, mandating the use of white or closely related light shades for building exteriors, with any deviation necessitating strict governmental approval. These regulations are part of Oman‚Äôs broader building codes and planning standards, designed to ensure environmental sustainability, social cohesion, and architectural integrity across rapidly modernizing urban centres.From historical architectural influences inspired by Islamic and traditional Omani culture to modern environmental considerations, the required use of whitewash and light colours serves to connect Omani cities with their past while addressing contemporary urban challenges.Residents and property developers who desire alternative colours must undergo a rigorous approval process, reflecting the government‚Äôs commitment to retaining Oman‚Äôs uniquely serene and cohesive cityscapes.Oman‚Äôs whitewashed urban landscape is a blend of practical wisdom, cultural pride, and legislative diligence. By tightly regulating external building colours, with strict preference for shades of white and requiring approval for all others, the Sultanate ensures that its skylines remain cool, harmonious, and deeply rooted in Omani identity and tradition. This makes Oman‚Äôs cityscapes unique in the Gulf and admired worldwide for their order, sustainability, and architectural beauty.",Oman‚Äôs building regulations mandate that exterior building colours must be white or light shades.

With the UAE‚Äôs rapid digital transformation fueling record smartphone and app usage, the nation‚Äôs top cybersecurity body has sounded the alarm on the dangers of unverified applications. In a warning underscored by recent spikes in cyber attacks, the UAE Cybersecurity Council called on the public to adopt strict mobile safety habits, as part of an all-out effort to bolster cyber protection across the Emirates The warning arrives at a critical juncture. In 2025, daily cyber attacks in the UAE have approached 200,000, according to government estimates, impacting public and private sectors as well as individual users.Cyber criminals have increasingly leveraged malicious apps to distribute malware, steal financial data, commit identity theft, and access sensitive personal information, a risk heightened during national events, holidays, and times of increased online activity.Key Elements of the Council‚Äôs Guidance:The Council stresses the necessity of using the official Apple App Store, Google Play, or equivalent trusted sources.Third-party or unofficial app stores common sources of malware and should be avoided completely.Users are urged to carefully review what permissions an app requests during installation. Excessive access to contacts, messages, camera, or location, beyond what is required for the app‚Äôs function can be a red flag for spyware or fraud.The Council highlights that keeping your operating system and apps updated with the latest security patches is essential, as vulnerabilities are regularly exploited by cybercriminals.Phishing remains a popular attack vector; users are told to avoid tapping on links or downloading files sent from unknown or suspicious sources, whether via text, emails, or messaging apps.These warnings are being reinforced through ongoing public campaigns, including the ""Cyber Pulse"" initiative, aimed at increasing awareness and teaching practical steps for online self-defence.Reports show a 63% year-over-year rise in detected mobile app vulnerabilities in the Emirates, with finance, healthcare, and logistics sectors most at risk.Federal laws such as the UAE Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL) and the National Electronic Security Authority (NESA) regulations require businesses to ensure digital safety, perform regular audits, and report breaches. Non-compliance can result in steep penalties.The Central Bank of the UAE has mandated a transition from less secure authentication (e.g., SMS/email OTPs), pushing for more secure, app-based verification to further reduce common fraud risks.As part of its Vision 2030 and National Cybersecurity Strategy, the UAE government is investing in:Multi-tiered strategies including public education, regulatory updates, and enhanced sector-specific protections.Establishing Security Operations Centres (SOCs) across government and critical infrastructure to detect and neutralize cyber threats in real-time.Ongoing training, audits, and collaborative drills are now routine for government employees, businesses, and the public, aiming to make robust cybersecurity second nature.The UAE‚Äôs warning about unverified apps isn‚Äôt a mere caution, it‚Äôs a direct response to the evolving sophistication of cyberthreats targeting a digitally connected population. By following the cybersecurity best practices outlined above and relying solely on verified sources, citizens and businesses can significantly reduce their vulnerability. The Council‚Äôs latest alert, grounded in real-time threat data and enforced through ongoing public education, marks another step in the country‚Äôs determined campaign to make the UAE a global model for safe, resilient, and trusted digital living.","The UAE Cybersecurity Council has issued a nation-wide warning urging residents to avoid downloading unverified mobile applications.

On 1 August 2025, Kahramaa, Qatar General Electricity and Water Corporation, announced that Qatar has surpassed 300 fast electric vehicle (EV) chargers, a major milestone in building a robust EV ecosystem aligned with its sustainability goals.During a community engagement event at Al Thumama's Kahramaa Awareness Park, engineers and EV users gathered to assess charger performance, usability, and discuss future expansions. The mobile app showcased allows users to track charging sessions, receive real‚Äëtime updates, and report issues, increasing transparency and control for EV drivers. Kahramaa officials emphasised that public feedback will shape further infrastructure enhancements.Looking ahead, plans include expanding charger availability in residential areas, shopping malls, and public parking zones to meet growing demand from EV owners.EV chargers, also known as electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), come in two major types: AC chargers and DC chargers.Charging speeds are categorized as:These fast chargers installed in Qatar fall under Level 3: high-voltage DC units capable of charging most EVs to 80% in under 30 minutes, ideal for roadside use, malls, and strategic hubs.The EV charging rollout aligns with Qatar‚Äôs broader strategy to diversify energy use, lower carbon emissions, and nurture sustainable mobility avenues.Fast DC chargers reduce range anxiety, making EV ownership more practical, especially given that most users rely on public infrastructure while apartment charging remains limited.Kahramaa‚Äôs mobile app, data tracking, and community dialogue models reinforce a user-centric approach, ensuring charger performance evolves with feedback.Qatar‚Äôs surpassing of 300 fast EV chargers marks a significant stride toward electrified transport under its Vision 2030 blueprint. These high-speed DC chargers offer rapid refueling, increased convenience, and drive cleaner mobility choices. Supported by smart apps, infrastructure engagement, and expansion plans, Qatar is accelerating into a greener transport future.","Qatar has installed over 300 fast EV chargers nationwide as of 1 August 2025 under its green mobility initiative. DC fast chargers deliver high-power, rapid charging, often bringing EV batteries from 20% to 80% in under 30 minutes. Infrastructure supports Qatar National Vision 2030 by promoting clean transport, reducing emissions, and enhancing convenience through digital tools.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123073663,imgsize-32452,width-400,resizemode-4/123073663.jpg"

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here‚Äôs a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Bill Gates warns Gen Z: AI will wipe out entry-level jobs, don‚Äôt rely on tech alone",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-warns-gen-z-ai-will-wipe-out-entry-level-jobs-dont-rely-on-tech-alone/articleshow/123140100.cms,"Bill Gates says AI will reshape ‚Äî and eliminate ‚Äî many entry-level jobs

Gen Z‚Äôs shifting career strategy

AI literacy isn‚Äôt enough anymore



As artificial intelligence rapidly reshapes the workforce, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates has issued a stark warning to Generation Z: simply learning to use AI tools won‚Äôt be enough to secure a stable job. While Gates believes smart systems are ‚Äúfun and empowering,‚Äù he cautions that their growing presence is already causing serious disruptions in the entry-level job market. Despite the hype surrounding AI literacy, recent graduates are still struggling to find work in a competitive and shrinking employment landscape.Gates encourages young people to remain curious and embrace new technologies, but he admits there‚Äôs no guarantee it will shield them from dislocation. Entry-level roles are vanishing as companies increasingly automate tasks that once provided a starting point for new workers.The rise of AI has caused a sharp decline in traditional entry-level opportunities. Job postings for such roles have dropped by 35% in the US since January 2023, with industries favoring automation over new hires. Sectors like finance and consulting are already replacing research and basic analytical tasks with AI systems. A 2024 report from the Burning Glass Institute found that automation now threatens 60% of entry-level roles across multiple sectors. Meanwhile, McKinsey forecasts that by 2030, up to 30% of work hours in the US could be automated, disproportionately affecting younger job seekers. Employers now seek junior employees with oversight skills rather than fresh graduates looking to learn on the job.Even small companies are cutting back. Futurety, a consulting firm in Ohio, opted not to hire a summer intern this year, relying instead on ChatGPT to handle social media content creation. As AI tools become more capable, the need for junior staff to handle foundational tasks continues to decline.With automation replacing office work, many Gen Z job seekers are pivoting toward careers that AI cannot easily replicate. A growing number are pursuing skilled trades like plumbing, electrical work, or elevator installation‚Äîjobs that offer stability, strong wages, and don‚Äôt require a traditional college degree.Others are turning to people-focused professions such as education, healthcare, and social work, where human interaction remains essential. According to a recent survey, 53% of Gen Z respondents are considering roles in skilled labor or social services, reflecting a major shift away from the white-collar path their parents once followed.Gates still recommends young people stay updated on AI, but he‚Äôs clear that understanding the tools alone won‚Äôt be a safety net. Instead, adaptability, emotional intelligence, and hands-on skills are becoming just as crucial. Many employers now prioritize candidates who can combine tech fluency with creative thinking and human judgment. In a rapidly changing job market, the ability to collaborate, communicate effectively, and problem-solve in real-world situations is gaining value. Companies increasingly seek ""T-shaped"" individuals‚Äîthose with deep knowledge in one area and broad, adaptable capabilities across others.In a landscape where AI continues to outpace traditional job growth, Gen Z faces the challenge of future-proofing their careers not just through education‚Äîbut through reinvention.",Bill Gates says AI will reshape ‚Äî and eliminate ‚Äî many entry-level jobs.

What better way for Microsoft to celebrate its 50 years of existence?That Bliss photograph, snapped in Sonoma County back in 1998, might just be the most viewed image in human history, so why not slap it on some rubber shoes? The $80 limited-edition clogs feature those iconic rolling green hills and puffy white clouds, with the blue sky covering the top while green soles mimic the grassy fields.Each pair comes loaded with six nostalgic Jibbitz charms including the MSN butterfly logo, Internet Explorer icon, a mouse pointer, and yes, everyone's favorite (or most dreaded) digital assistant Clippy. There's even a matching drawstring bag sporting the Bliss design, just in case people couldn't tell you were representing Windows XP hard enough.The Verge says that Microsoft employees will get first dibs on preorders before the worldwide launch hits, continuing the company's tradition of quirky anniversary merchandise. Remember those Windows ugly sweaters? The Minesweeper one? The Clippy holiday special? This is just the natural evolution of Microsoft's commitment to turning operating system nostalgia into wearable art.Whether you lived through the Windows XP era or just appreciate that peak early-2000s aesthetic, these Crocs are either the perfect conversation starter or the ultimate cry for help. Either way, they'll probably sell out faster than you can say ""It looks like you're trying to buy shoes.""",Microsoft is releasing a limited-edition pair of foam Crocs.
