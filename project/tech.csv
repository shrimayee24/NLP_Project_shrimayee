A well-known French plastic surgeon , Olivier Gerbault , has been suspended from practicing for two years after multiple patients accused him of performing unsatisfactory nose surgeries. Gerbault , known for his ultrasonic rhinoplasty technique, allegedly left some patients with breathing difficulties and deformities.Several women who filed complaints with the medical ethics committee described their noses as resembling ""potatoes"" after the procedures, according to a New York Post report. Elisa, one of the patients, said:‚ÄúMy nose was long, crooked, thick, and looked like a potato. My left nostril was collapsing, and I couldn‚Äôt get any air through.‚ÄùAnother patient, Chlo√©, reported similar experiences, claiming her nose became infected and her nostrils collapsed after the surgery. She said:‚ÄúI had a lump [in place of my nose], a big potato.

""When I woke up, I was vomiting liters of blood. The doctor must have used a trowel. Since then, I‚Äôve had a horrible burning sensation, air rushes in too strongly, and it gets on my nerves.

Macquarie Dictionary names 'Enshittification' Word of the Year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/australian-dictionary-picks-enshittification-as-word-of-the-year/articleshow/115714471.cms,"File photo

SYDNEY: Australia's quasi-official Macquarie Dictionary has picked "" enshittification "" as the word of 2024, tapping into a growing sense that once-great digital services are bad and getting worse.""ENSHITTIFICATION -- Noun. Colloquial, the gradual deterioration of a service or product brought about by a reduction in the quality of service provided, especially of an online platform, and as a consequence of profit-seeking.""The word, coined by writer Cory Doctorow , refers to a process in which apps or digital platforms start off as incredibly useful, but gradually worsen as they seek to make a profit.Social media platforms like X and ride-sharing app Uber are frequently cited examples, which started off offering information or bargains but gradually gouged customers or cut back services.Doctorow explains enshittification as the reason why Facebook users' feeds fill up with junk, Google search is loaded with ads and sponsored content, and why Amazon promotes cheap, badly made products no matter what a customer searches for.Enshittification beat out words like ""brainrot"", ""overtourism"" and ""rawdogging"".It was chosen as word of the year by the dictionary's committee of experts, but was also voted ""People's Choice Winner"".It is ""a very basic Anglo-Saxon term wrapped in affixes which elevate it to being almost formal; almost respectable,"" the committee said.""This word captures what many of us feel is happening to the world and to so many aspects of our lives at the moment,"" the committee said.","Australia's quasi-official Macquarie Dictionary has picked "" enshittification "" as the word of 2024.

Grimes Channels Pain Into Art



Claire Grimes Boucher , widely known as Grimes, has spoken candidly about her evolving relationship with Elon Musk , the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX , with whom she shares three children. In a heartfelt post on X (formerly Twitter), the Canadian artist revealed how Musk's political transformation and personal decisions have profoundly impacted their bond, leading her to describe him as ""no longer the man I fell in love with.""Grimes (Claire Boucher) and Elon Musk met in a way that highlights their shared interests in technology and creativity.Their first interaction took place on Twitter in early 2018, when Musk was preparing to tweet a joke about artificial intelligence and a pun involving a character from 18th-century philosophy.Musk had come up with a joke about a thought experiment known as ""Roko's Basilisk,"" blending it with a pun on ""Rococo,"" an ornate art style. However, he discovered that Grimes had already made a similar joke in 2015 through her music video for ""Flesh Without Blood,"" where she referenced ""Rococo Basilisk."" Impressed by her wit and intrigued by her knowledge of esoteric topics, Musk reached out to her.The two connected over their shared fascination with futuristic ideas, artificial intelligence, and creative exploration. Their mutual appreciation for the intersection of art and technology sparked a rapport, and their online conversation soon turned into a real-life meeting. By May 2018, they made their first public appearance as a couple at the Met Gala, surprising many fans and media observers.However, their bond became strained over time due to their differing lifestyles and public scrutiny. Despite having two children together, they announced in 2021 that they were ""semi-separated.""Grimes shared her struggle in detaching from Musk, whom she once described as the love of her life. She highlighted how his shift towards conservative political ideologies, including his contentious relationship with his transgender daughter , Vivian Jenna Wilson, has made him seem ""unrecognizable"" to her. The artist has been vocal in her support for Vivian, contrasting with Musk‚Äôs alleged actions that she finds difficult to reconcile with the person she once knew.Musk's increasing alignment with right-wing politics, including his support for Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign, appears to have widened the gap between him and Grimes. While she has remained apolitical in public, the ideological differences seem to have strained their personal connection.In her post, Grimes hinted at significant challenges beyond their political differences. She alluded to feeling distanced from Musk‚Äôs intellectual and financial resources during their separation. She also mentioned the pain of being separated from one of their children for five months amid legal disputes. These revelations underscore the emotional toll their relationship has taken, though Grimes emphasized that some details remain private.Despite the turmoil, Grimes expressed how her personal challenges have inspired her creativity. She revealed that her upcoming artistic projects, while potentially provocative, are deeply rooted in her experiences. Grimes hopes her work will resonate with those who can relate to the complexities of love, change, and resilience.","Claire Grimes Boucher, widely known as Grimes, has spoken candidly about her evolving relationship with Elon Musk.

Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, ‚ÄúTo do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Instead, her ‚Äúbrand new Alexa‚Äù only responds with, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt knowWhile the TikTok video has garnered over a million views, many are skeptical about the accuracy of the prediction, attributing it to a glitch or a pre-programmed response. However, the eerie timing of the prediction, coming shortly after one of the most 'divided' US presidential election, has fueled speculation and sparked a range of reactions, from humor to concern.This isn't the first time Amazon's AI assistant has generated controversy. Earlier this year, Alexa devices were accused of providing biased responses, favoring specific political candidates. Amazon attributed the incident to an error that was quickly rectified.While Alexa's apocalyptic vision may be a mere quirk, it serves as a reminder of the growing influence of AI in our lives and the need for careful oversight.","A recent TikTok video has sent the internet abuzz after an Amazon Alexa device made a chilling prediction about the United States.

WWE Wrestlers Who Got The Short End: The Unsung Icons

In WWE, several factors contribute towards the success of a wrestler‚Äôs career. WWE holds a limited spotlight for its top stars, and some wrestlers are simply overshadowed by more established superstars. The focus is more on wrestlers with larger-than-life characters, hands-on mic skills, and the ability to appeal to a wide demographic. Being underrated in WWE is a combination of factors, and not all of them are in control of wrestlers themselves.Despite a wrestler‚Äôs talent, ability to entertain, and in-ring wrestling skills, some wrestlers don‚Äôt get the opportunity that would elevate them to the level of the icons. While some individuals are able to break through these barriers and achieve stardom, some remain underappreciated for a long time.Here‚Äôs a list of stars that could‚Äôve had a more prominent presence in the WWE universe.During Ziggler‚Äôs peak years, superstars like John Cena, Randy Orton, Triple H, and The Rock dominated the top spots, leaving very little space for Ziggler to be consistently pushed as a top-tier talent. Although Ziggler‚Äôs performance was great in the midcard matches, due to inconsistency in storyline and lack of character development, fans connected less to the star.While his in-ring abilities were universally praised, he was often not given a chance to carry a major feud and championship program in WWE.The Miz is a great in-ring performer, known for his top-notch mic skills and promo skills. He was often viewed as a ‚Äúreality star‚Äù rather than a legitimate wrestler due to his origins on The Real World. This overshadowed his in-ring ability for a long time.Despite being WWE‚Äôs most effective heel, Miz‚Äôs character was highly misunderstood by the fans. His wrestling skills were overlooked due to his comedic roles and his midcard booking.Despite having incredible in-ring skills and physical strength, Cesaro was frequently booked in midcard or tag-team roles. Cesaro‚Äôs character was never strongly defined or promoted as compared to other stars, despite having multiple high-profile matches and TAG team success (especially with Sheamus as The Bar).Cesaro‚Äôs prime years coincided with major stars like John Cena, Roman Reigns, and Daniel Bryan, which made it even more difficult for him to break through to the main event scene despite his talent.Before joining WWE, he was one of the most highly regarded wrestlers in the world. Nakamura‚Äôs time in NXT was hugely successful, where he had great matches and built a strong following. However, WWE did not capitalize on his massive potential. Nakamura‚Äôs Japanese heritage and lack of fluency in English also became one of the reasons for his underwhelming appeal outside the ring, which made him unrelatable to the fans.His potential was often sidelined due to several reasons, like inconsistency in storylines, lack of character development, and language barriers.Zayn has been part of major storylines, like his involvement with Roman Reigns and The Bloodline. His ability to connect with the audience, whether as a Babyface or Heel, is a major asset. However, being booked as an underdog babyface limited his potential in the eyes of the fans and management. Lack of significant title reigns and inconsistent character direction prevented him from being recognized as WWE‚Äôs top-tier star.Despite these challenges, Zayn‚Äôs true potential is recognized among his fans and wrestlers.Roode‚Äôs transition from TNA to WWE brought high expectations. His ‚ÄúGlorious‚Äù persona became popular almost immediately. While he held the United States Championship and TAG Team championships, his main roster run was never fully materialized in terms of a world title push.Roode was a standout in NXT and enjoyed a successful run, whereas WWE did not capitalize on the potential he built in NXT.ALSO READ: The Dark Side of WWE: Legal Battles These are just some names who remain underrated due to the noted factors; however, the recognition of their skill and work ethic by fans and peers alike shows that, even underrated, these superstars contribute significantly to the overall success and entertainment value of WWE.","WWE holds a limited spotlight for its top stars, and some wrestlers are simply overshadowed by more established superstars.
