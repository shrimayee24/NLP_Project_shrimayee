German Bakery accused gets no relief from solitary confinement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/german-bakery-accused-gets-no-relief-from-solitary-confinement/articleshow/118368135.cms,"MUMBAI: Bombay HC on Tuesday rejected a petition by Mirza Himayat Baig , who was convicted in the 2010 Pune German Bakery blast case , to shift him to a general barrack from solitary confinement .""At this stage, there is no concern about any psychological trauma on account of any indefinite solitary confinement,"" said Justices Revati Mohite Dere and Neela Gokhale. Baig was convicted in April 2013 and sentenced to death. In March 2016, the HC commuted it to life imprisonment.Baig wrote a letter in 2018, through Nashik Road Central Prison , and urged to provide him work to contribute towards the livelihood of his economically marginalised family. Advocate Mujahid Ansari, who was appointed to represent Baig, said he suffered 14 years of incarceration. He is lodged in an ""anda cell."" He is kept in solitary confinement and is mentally disturbed because of the cell. Ansari said no harm would be caused if he is shifted to general barracks where there is no security risk.Prosecutor Prajakta Shinde said the ""anda cell"", a high-security wing, is like any other barrack. It has sufficient light and air. There is a passage and long corridor for the prisoner to exercise. There are also other prisoners who can interact with each other. A TV and FM radio are provided for entertainment. Daily newspapers and books are provided to prisoners. There is a facility of a smart card phone in the cell to call family members and advocates and even an e-mulakat facility.The judges perused a Sept 2012 circular that mandates high-risk prisoners to be lodged in specific cells/barracks. Taking note of the State's affidavit that there have been incidents in the prison of scuffles and attacks, they said, ""it is for the prison authority to ascertain threat and perception in respect of the detenues."" ""Since we are satisfied that the petitioner is not in solitary confinement, we see no reason to direct the jail authorities to transfer the petitioner to a general barrack,"" they added. They directed that Baig ""may be assigned work in consonance with prison rules/regulations.""","Mirza Himayat Baig was convicted in the 2010 Pune German Bakery blast case.

Liam Lawson Expects a Challenging Red Bull F1 Debut



Liam Lawson on the 2025 F1 Season, Advice For Rookies, & George Russell's Escape Room Skills

Liam Lawson is set to make his highly anticipated full-season debut in Formula 1, stepping into a Red Bull seat alongside Max Verstappen . However, the young Kiwi is under no illusions about the challenges ahead. With only 11 grand prix starts under his belt, all of which came in the latter half of 2023 and 2024, Lawson acknowledges that adapting to the demands of a full F1 calendar will be a daunting task.Liam Lawson was officially named as Sergio Perez’s replacement in December, following a disappointing season for the Mexican driver. Despite Red Bull’s dominant performance last year, the 22-year-old driver is not expecting immediate success, particularly given his lack of experience on several circuits that feature early in the 2025 calendar.The upcoming season will introduce Lawson to a host of unfamiliar tracks, adding an extra layer of difficulty to his transition into one of F1’s most competitive seats. “Going into a year like this, especially the start of the season, I’m going to a lot of tracks I haven’t done before,” he admitted. “I think the start of the year is going to be the hardest as well. Going to a bunch of tracks I haven’t done before starting the season, it’s going to be very, very tough.”While the Red Bull RB21 is expected to be a front-running car, Lawson is not setting unrealistic expectations for himself. His early-season schedule includes challenging circuits like Melbourne, Shanghai, Miami, and Montreal—places he has either never raced on or only experienced in junior categories. Nonetheless, he remains eager to embrace the challenge, stating, “I’m very excited for Melbourne and I’m very excited for the start of the year.”Despite the uphill battle, Lawson is looking forward to proving himself at the highest level. “There’s a lot of cool tracks that I haven’t done that I think I will enjoy, like Melbourne. China looks like a cool track, Canada is somewhere I’ve always wanted to drive.”Also Read: ""Anyone who doubts him is silly"": Lando Norris slams critics of Lewis Hamilton ahead of Ferrari F1 debut With a new team, heightened expectations, and an uncharted season ahead, Lawson is prepared for what could be his toughest yet most rewarding year in Formula 1.","Liam Lawson is set to make his full-season debut in Formula 1 with Red Bull.

Apple is set to introduce design changes to its iPhone lineup later this year, according to recent reports.

This new design language aims to bring a fresh look to the iPhone lineup, with the Pro models featuring a part-aluminum, part-glass rear design. The top half of the iPhone will be made of aluminum, housing a rectangular camera bump, while the bottom half will remain glass to support wireless charging.Additionally, the iPhone 17 Pro Max is rumoured to come with a smaller Dynamic Island, thanks to metalens technology that allows for more compact Face ID components. This change is expected to be exclusive to the Pro models, with the standard and Plus variants continuing to use the existing Dynamic Island design.The iPhone 17 series is expected to debut in the fall, with Apple likely to unveil the new devices at a special event in September. As the tech community eagerly awaits these updates, the significant design changes promise to offer a fresh and innovative experience for iPhone users.","The iPhone 17 series is expected to debut in the fall, with Apple likely to unveil the new devices at a special event in September.

Mikey Madison won the best actress prize for Brooklyn tragicomedy “Anora.”“Conclave,” which stars Ralph Fiennes as a cardinal corralling conniving clergy as they elect a new pope, beat “The Brutalist,” “Emilia Pérez,” Bob Dylan biopic “ A Complete Unknown "" to the top prize. ""Conclave” was also named outstanding British film and took trophies for editing and adapted screenplay.Supporting performer prizes went to Kieran Culkin for “A Real Pain” and Zoe Saldaña for “Emilia Pérez,"" which also won the award for best film not in the English language.Saldaña won for her role as a lawyer who helps the title character transition to a woman and out of a life of crime. She called the film “the creative challenge of a lifetime.”Best actress nominee Karla Sofía Gascón, who stars as the titular transgender ex-cartel boss in “Emilia Pérez,” wasn’t at the ceremony. Gascón has withdrawn from promoting the film, which has 13 Oscar nominations, amid controversy over her social media posts disparaging Muslims, George Floyd and diversity at the Oscars.Audiard has condemned those comments, but in his acceptance speech thanked Gascón and her co-stars Saldaña and Selena Gomez.“I am deeply proud of what we have all achieved together,"" he said.From the BAFTAs to the OscarsStars including Cynthia Erivo, Hugh Grant, Ariana Grande, Lupita Nyong’o, Timothée Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan walked the red carpet at London’s Royal Festival Hall for the awards, known as BAFTAs.The prizes will be watched for clues about who will triumph at Hollywood’s Academy Awards on March 2, in an unusually hard-to-call awards season.They also have a distinctly British accent. The ceremony kicked off with its kilt-wearing host, Scottish actor David Tennant, leading the audience in a rousing singalong of The Proclaimers’ anthem “I’m Gonna be (500 Miles).”Culkin's award came for “A Real Pain,” about odd couple cousins on a trip to explore their roots. The film's writer and co-star, Jesse Eisenberg, took the BAFTA for best original screenplay.“I’d like to share this with my wife, who didn’t come because she didn’t think I’d win,” Eisenberg quipped.“Anora,” about an exotic dancer entangled with a Russian oligarch's son, had been a best picture favorite after winning the top prizes last week at the Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards.“The Brutalist” had nine BAFTA nominations, while “Anora,” the sci-fi epic “Dune: Part Two” and musical “Wicked” hade seven each. “A Complete Unknown” and Irish-language hip-hop drama “Kneecap” received six nominations apiece.Brody won over stiff competition from Fiennes and Chalamet, who plays the young Dylan in “A Complete Unknown.” The other male actors nominated were Grant for his creepy role in the horror film “ Heretic,” Colman Domingo in real-life prison drama “ Sing Sing ” and Sebastian Stan for his portrayal of a young Donald Trump in “ The Apprentice.”Stan, who is also Oscar nominated, said it was “incredibly validating” to get recognition for the film, which initially struggled to find an American distributor. It's an origins story that focuses on Trump's relationship with ruthless power broker Roy Cohn, played by Jeremy Strong.“We were told this was going to be a thankless job that was never going to lead to anything,” Stan said, describing the movie as a “fair” depiction of the president.Best-actress nominees were Madison, Gascón, Demi Moore for body-horror film “ The Substance,” Ronan for “The Outrun,” Erivo for “Wicked” and Marianne Jean-Baptiste for the Mike Leigh drama “Hard Truths.” Erivo or Jean-Baptiste would have been the first non-white performer to win the leading actress BAFTA.Animated caper “Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl” won awards for best animated feature and best family and children’s film.Sci-fi epic “Dune: Part Two” won prizes for sound and visual effects. “The Brutalist” won for cinematography and musical score. Musical “Wicked” took the costume and production design trophies.Rising stars and lifetime honorsBritain’s film academy introduced changes to increase the awards’ diversity in 2020, when no women were nominated as best director for the seventh year running and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white.Most winners are chosen by 8,000 members of the U.K. academy of industry professionals, with one — the Rising Star Award —- selected by public vote from a shortlist of nominees. This year's winner was David Jonsson, star of high finance drama series “Industry” and London rom-com “Rye Lane.”“Star, I don’t know,” he said. “But rising, I guess.”“Willow” and “Return of the Jedi” actor Warwick Davis received the academy’s top honor, the BAFTA Fellowship, for his screen career and work to create a more inclusive film industry.He founded a talent agency for actors under 5 feet tall, because, he said, “short actors weren’t known for their talent, just their height.”BAFTA chairwoman Sara Putt sent a message of strength to everyone hit by last month’s devastating Los Angeles wildfires. Jamie Lee Curtis, a supporting actress nominee for “The Last Showgirl,” was absent because the fires delayed filming on her current work.The event was without a dash of royal glamour this year. Neither Prince William, who is honorary president of the British film academy, nor his wife Kate are attending. The awards coincide with school holidays for their three children.William, 42, sent a recorded video message that was played before the presentation of the Rising Star Award.","Papal thriller ""Conclave "" wins four prizes including best picture.

Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic. In his memoir, Spare, the Duke of Sussex talks about reaching out to a medium with supernatural abilities to communicate with Diana, who passed away in a car accident in Paris in 1997, just before his 13th birthday, The Mirror reported.The Duke received a message from his mother through the psychic, who told him, ""You're living the life she wanted for you."" Harry, now 40, says that the medium also told him his mother was with him ""right now,"" which made his neck warm and his eyes fill with tears. The psychic shared that Diana knew Harry was ""looking for clarity"" and ""feels your confusion."" She added that Diana understood Harry had ""so many questions"" and that answers would come in time.Another anecdote involved Prince Harry’s son, Archie. The psychic reportedly described how Diana’s spirit witnessed Archie accidentally breaking a Christmas tree ornament shaped like Queen Elizabeth. When asked, Harry admitted the incident had occurred, adding that Archie had attempted to fix the ornament.The medium suggested Diana found humour in the situation, delighting in the antics of her grandson she never had the chance to meet.In Spare, Prince Harry also recounts an extraordinary encounter with a leopard during a trip to Botswana with his brother, Prince William. He interpreted the animal’s presence as a comforting sign from his late mother, suggesting that ""everything will be fine."" However, the experience was not without fear, as he briefly worried the leopard might attack.Harry has been candid about the psychological toll of losing Diana so young. As reported by The Mirror, he disclosed a haunting period after her death when he entertained the possibility that she had staged her demise. His anguish led him to repeatedly drive through the Paris tunnel where Diana’s life was cut short, attempting to make sense of the tragedy.","Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic.

This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109067339,imgsize-51000,width-400,resizemode-4/109067339.jpg"

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.

Why are these passwords vulnerable



Common usage – Millions of people use these passwords, making them a top priority for hacking attempts.

– Millions of people use these passwords, making them a top priority for hacking attempts. Predictability – Sequential numbers and generic words are among the first combinations tested by cybercriminals.

– Sequential numbers and generic words are among the first combinations tested by cybercriminals. Brute-force attacks – Hackers use automated programs that rapidly try common passwords until they gain access.

Risks of using weak passwords

Identity theft – Hackers can steal personal information and impersonate victims online.

– Hackers can steal personal information and impersonate victims online. Financial fraud – Weak passwords can give cybercriminals access to banking and payment platforms, leading to unauthorized transactions.

– Weak passwords can give cybercriminals access to banking and payment platforms, leading to unauthorized transactions. Unauthorised account access – Social media, email, and cloud storage accounts may be compromised, resulting in data loss or misuse.

– Social media, email, and cloud storage accounts may be compromised, resulting in data loss or misuse. Business data breaches – Employees using weak passwords can expose entire organizations to cyber threats, leading to financial losses and reputational damage.

How to strengthen your password security

Use complex passwords: Create passwords that are at least 12-16 characters long, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. Avoid predictable patterns like “12345” or “password.”

Avoid personal information: Do not use easily accessible personal details such as your name, birthdate, or pet’s name. Hackers can retrieve this information from social media profiles.

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a verification code in addition to a password. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access accounts even if they have stolen login credentials.

Use unique passwords for each account: Never reuse passwords across multiple accounts. If one account is compromised, all linked accounts become vulnerable.

Utilise a password manager: Password managers generate and store strong, unique passwords for each account, reducing the need to memorise complex combinations.

Regularly update passwords: Change passwords every 3-6 months to reduce the risk of long-term exposure. Avoid using old passwords repeatedly.

Beware of phishing attacks: Hackers often trick users into revealing passwords through fraudulent emails or fake login pages. Always verify the legitimacy of websites before entering credentials.

"Elon Musk’s ex-girlfriend Shivon Zilis chats with Grok 3 for hours, shares experience",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-ex-girlfriend-shivon-zilis-chats-with-grok-3-for-hours-shares-experience/articleshow/118350308.cms,"Read the complete post here

Woah! That was one of the most unexpectedly rewarding hours of my life.

Instead of passively listening to an audiobook about physics while doing errands as usual I had an hour long back-and-forth conversation with Ara from Grok 3 about a bunch of scientific topics.

We started with the role of

in biology and she presented a ton of options for me to rabbit hole down. We somehow ended up on quantum entanglement and by the end I asked her to grill me to make sure I actually understood what she told me.

She was quite cordial about politely letting me know when I only gave half-right answers and guided me into make sure I understood the rest. Was cool that she got the factual stuff right and provided an upbeat emotional vibe to keep me motivated.

The best part for me was no question was too “dumb” for her to answer so I wasn’t embarrassed to ask questions I would feel silly asking a human who I looked up to.

I’ve wanted to deepen my knowledge of physics and other sciences for years but haven’t had time to formally go back to school and have felt too guilty to harass my friends to teach me, and the reality is I learn best through conversations so

was my best friend on this one.

In a demonstration of xAI's latest artificial intelligence chatbot, Grok 3, Shivon Zilis , a key partner at xAI and Elon Musk ’s ex-girlfriend shared her experience of engaging in an extended conversation with the AI. The launch event, held on February 17, 2025, showcased Grok 3 's advanced capabilities, including its ability to hold meaningful and dynamic conversations.Zilis, who is also the mother of Elon Musk's 12th child, took to X (formerly known as Twitter) to describe her interaction with Grok 3. She highlighted the chatbot's impressive performance in various topics, ranging from bioelectricity to quantum entanglement . ""The absence of hesitation when asking ‘basic’ questions was revolutionary,"" Zilis noted, emphasising the AI's ability to balance factual rigor with motivational engagement.During the live demo, Grok 3 demonstrated its potential not only in scientific and technological fields but also in entertainment and creative domains.
