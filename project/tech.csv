Travis Kelce discusses creative vision and inspiration behind Tru Kolors x AE

A Swift Debrief, Travis’ Preseason Prep and Starting Shedeur | EP 151

This week has been a whirlwind for Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce , both on the personal and professional fronts. On Tuesday, the tight end confirmed his engagement to pop superstar Taylor Swift, sending fans into a frenzy. Just a day later, Kelce made headlines again—but this time in the fashion world—with the launch of his collaboration with American Eagle.The American Eagle partnership, titled “Tru Kolors x AE,” features a diverse group of athletes, including Olympic gold medalist Suni Lee, Penn State quarterback Drew Allar, and Syracuse basketball guard Kiyan Anthony.Sharing photos from the collaboration on Instagram, Kiyan Anthony received an encouraging comment from Kelce: “Only the real ones! 🔥🔥🔥.” This simple four-word message resonated with fans and reinforced Kelce’s reputation as someone who values authenticity and camaraderie.On the “New Heights” podcast, Kelce opened up about his role as creative director for the line. “So as of today, we will have dropped the collaboration between Tru Kolors and American Eagle, and I am the creative director for it,” he said. He explained that the goal was to design pieces that combine comfort and style while allowing people to express themselves through vibrant colors and flowing fabrics.“It was so much fun collaborating with American Eagle. They are so professional. They have the ability to really bring everything to life that you can imagine. I wanted to make something fun, kind of like a very flowy line that kind of just drapes on you with all these cool fabrics.”Also Read: “Just another game”: Aaron Rodgers downplays Packers legacy, shocks fans by calling reunion meaningless The line launched on Wednesday, with a second wave of apparel scheduled for September 24.

Antonio Brown’s five-word post ignites the internet

Tyreek Hill, Keeta Vaccaro, and the real financial stakes

The personal and financial fallout of Tyreek Hill’s short-lived marriage is making headlines, but it was Antonio Brown’s online commentary that sent the story viral. The Miami Dolphins wide receiver is reportedly facing steep divorce obligations to estranged wife Keeta Vaccaro, and Brown wasted no time in weighing in with his trademark bluntness. What could have been just another celebrity divorce update quickly morphed into a cultural flashpoint about money, respect, and the realities of high-profile relationships.Sports insider Dov Kleiman reported that Hill could be forced to pay Vaccaro between $20,000 and $50,000 per month in “spending money,” along with a one-off “$500,000” check. Brown quote-posted the report with the line, “Them Miami Hoes Will Get You Everytime…”His phrasing immediately overshadowed the financial figures. Critics argued his comment was misogynistic, while others defended it as hard-edged honesty about the risks athletes face when wealth and love collide. Brown, already known for stirring controversy, once again positioned himself at the center of an NFL-adjacent debate.Beyond the viral soundbite, Hill’s legal situation is no joke. After only 15 months of marriage, the potential settlement figures reflect not just his multimillion-dollar earnings but also the lifestyle considerations courts often factor into support cases. One fan’s reply captured the financial angle perfectly: “When will guys learn the magical word… prenup…”It’s a reminder that behind every high-profile romance lies the practical question of asset protection. For Hill, who remains one of the league’s brightest stars, the financial toll could be significant both on and off the field.Also Read: “Taylor Swift fans in doggy”: Antonio Brown mocks Swifties with crude meme sparking online outrage The Brown-fueled uproar proves one thing: in today’s NFL, divorce drama doesn’t just play out in courtrooms — it’s fought on timelines, reshaped in memes, and debated by millions in real time.","Antonio Brown’s five-word post ignites the internet about Tyreek Hill.

US First Lady Melania Trump is stepping into the tech spotlight, launching a national program to get children thinking about artificial intelligence. But while the initiative comes with lofty promises, it’s short on details, and that’s the catch.On Tuesday, the First Lady’s office announced the President’s Artificial Intelligence Challenge, inviting students from kindergarten through 12th grade to take part. “This will be the first step in preparing our next generation with a base understanding of this important new technology,” Melania said in a statement.In a video posted to her X account, she tied the launch to her personal experience of using AI to produce the audiobook of her memoir Melania. “As someone who created an AI-powered audiobook and championed online safety through the Take It Down Act, I’ve seen firsthand the promise of this powerful technology,” she said. “Just as America once led the world into the skies, we are poised to lead again, this time in the age of AI. ”What the challenge will actually involve, however, remains vague. The announcement offered no specifics on what students will be asked to do, or how the program will be run.Melania, who has no formal background in technology, is also expected to play an undefined role in the initiative.Still, she has shown a growing interest in digital issues. In addition to her AI audiobook, she backed the Take It Down Act, which requires platforms to remove non-consensual intimate images, including AI-generated ones, within two days.Since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, Melania has kept a low profile, spending much of her time in New York where her son Barron is at university. This new initiative marks one of her first high-profile moves in the second Trump presidency, though for now, the details remain as elusive as the technology she’s embracing.","US First Lady Melania Trump is launching a national program to get children thinking about artificial intelligence.

South Korea has enacted nationwide legislation banning smartphone use in school classrooms, with lawmakers passing the bill on Wednesday, August 26, 2025, to address growing concerns about smartphone addiction among students, as per a report by BBC. The measure, approved by 115 out of 163 lawmakers present, aims to improve academic performance and social interactions among children and teenagers, with implementation scheduled for the next school year beginning March 2026.The new legislation comes as South Korean educators, parents, and lawmakers have observed declining academic progress and performance linked to excessive smartphone use in educational settings. The ban encompasses mobile phones and other smart devices within classroom environments.The initiative aligns South Korea with several other nations that have implemented similar restrictions. Countries including Finland and France have established phone bans specifically for younger students, while Italy, the Netherlands, and China have implemented broader restrictions across all school levels.Many South Korean schools had already implemented various forms of smartphone restrictions prior to this nationwide mandate.The new law formalizes these practices and establishes consistent standards across the country's educational institutions.The implementation timeline provides schools and educational authorities several months to prepare for the transition and establish necessary protocols before the law takes effect in March 2026.The ban reflects growing global awareness of smartphone addiction among youngsters and its potential impact on educational outcomes. Educational institutions worldwide are increasingly examining their policies regarding mobile device use in academic settings.","South Korea has enacted nationwide legislation banning smartphone use in school classrooms.

Royal Lodge context (often bundled into the rumors)

Where public opinion sits

What could change in the next reign

A new sovereign could:

Maintain the 2022 limits;

Tighten style/usage via letters patent (e.g., continued non-use of HRH); or

Ask ministers to explore legislation if removing a peerage were desired.

Bottom line

Facts today:

Talk has picked up again about what happens to Prince Andrew’s titles in the next reign. Several outlets claim Prince William wants a tougher line and could look at further steps once he is king. There is no official plan on record; the stories rely on unnamed sources and remain unconfirmed.In January 2022, Buckingham Palace announced that the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages were returned to the Queen and that he would not undertake public duties; at the same time, briefings confirmed he would no longer use the HRH style in an official capacity. He remains Duke of York and holds no front-line duties. None of that has changed.Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and, in some tellings, press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge. None of this has been announced; it is framed as a possibility, not a decision.A dukedom is a peerage, which is a legal dignity. Removing a peerage requires an Act of Parliament; the House of Lords Library is explicit on this point. The last time Parliament provided a mechanism to strip titles was the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, drafted for wartime enemies, hardly a ready tool for modern scandal.Any fresh action would almost certainly need new legislation.By contrast, styles (like HRH) sit within the sovereign’s power to define by letters patent, hence the 1917 letters patent that limited who is HRH. Using letters patent to refine style/usage is established; using them to annul a peerage would collide with statute and convention. In practice, government-backed legislation is the clean route for removing a dukedom.Prince Andrew holds a 75-year Crown Estate lease on Royal Lodge dating from 2003. Changing his residence would be a landlord-tenant and lease issue, not a simple royal edict. Reporting about pressure to move has see-sawed, but the legal baseline is the lease itself.Recent polling shows strong support for going further: 67% of Britons say Andrew should be stripped of his remaining titles; only 13% are opposed. That mood is real but policy still comes down to law and process.Any move to remove a dukedom would prompt debates on due process, precedent, and where to draw the line for other peers.Andrew does not use HRH, holds no military roles or active patronages, and retains the Duke of York title. Any further step is not something a monarch can do “on a whim”; it would almost certainly require Parliament. Until a legal route exists and is pursued, this remains talk, not policy.","Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge. None of this has been announced; it is framed as a possibility, not a decision. Removing a peerage requires an Act of Parliament; the House of Lords Library is explicit on this point.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123493843,imgsize-51336,width-400,resizemode-4/123493843.jpg"
"Movement signatures: How we move, gesture, use facial expressions is unique; could be as different as fingerprint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/movement-signatures-how-we-move-gesture-use-facial-expressions-could-be-as-unique-as-fingerprint/articleshow/123483187.cms,"



MANCHESTER: The way someone walks, talks, smiles, or gestures gives a clue to who they are. Whether through the flick of an eyebrow, the rhythm of our walk, or the tilt of a head, movement speaks volumes.And my recent paper shows that people may have their own movement fingerprint. This is a style of movement that is characteristic of a person's identity. So, someone who uses expressive facial gestures might also speak with animated hand movements or walk with a lively gait. These consistencies could form a motion fingerprint that is unique to the individual.First, let's explore how faces move and why this matters.Everyone has their own style of moving their face, for example, how they raise an eyebrow, purse their lips, or squint when laughing. These patterns of movement help us recognise familiar people even when the visual quality is poor, such as in low lighting or from a distance. And as a person becomes more familiar to us, we become tuned to the way they move, learning their unique patterns of motion, just like we remember their face or voice.Human faces are constantly in motion; they blink, smile, grimace and talk, to name a few movements. Researchers categorise facial motion into rigid movements (such as turning or nodding the head) and non-rigid movements (like expressing emotion or speaking). It's the non-rigid movements that tend to be most personally distinctive.The way we gesture with our hands, shift our posture and tilt our heads all carry identity information. Gestures are often shaped by personal habits or cultural norms; for example, someone might habitually nod three times when agreeing, or use a distinctive hand wave common in their home country.Facial movements are synchronised with the way we sound. When we talk, our face plays a role in shaping the sound of our voice. For example, if you talk with a wide open mouth, your speech sounds deeper and richer. Studies show that people can match other people's voices to moving faces more accurately than to static ones. This suggests that dynamic cues to identity are present in the movement of the face and the sound of the voice.People with face recognition difficulties (those who are ""face blind"" or prosopagnosic) may be better at recognising moving faces than still ones. Typically, people who are face blind can see faces and the differences between them, but struggle to link the face to a specific person. Here, idiosyncratic information from movement can provide an additional clue to identity.Gait, a person's walking style, is one of the most studied body movements. Early research, such as a 2005 study, investigated participants' recognition of identity from gait using point-light displays. In this case, bright spots (lights) were placed on key areas of a person's body. All other visual cues were removed. Participants could only see bright spots against a dark background. The study found participants could tell fairly well who someone was from the way the spots moved.Characteristics such as stride length, limb movement, posture and pace form a consistent motion pattern that is unique and surprisingly difficult to fake, making gait analysis a reliable clue for identifying people.Movement fingerprintsMy review brought together evidence from behavioural and brain imaging studies to consider if such consistencies between different types of motion exist and how we might explore this phenomenon further. The paper proposes that people have an overall style of movement.More work needs to be done to find direct evidence of movement fingerprints. For example, we still aren't sure what part of the brain processes these movement-based identity cues.So far, research shows that the posterior temporal sulcus - an area of the brain located roughly above your ear on each side - responds not just to faces and bodies, but to how someone moves more generally. This area is active when we hear voices or see people speak, suggesting it may help link motion and sound. Also, this region plays a key role in allowing us to understand our social world, interpreting other people's actions, determining where they are looking, and picking up on social cues such as gestures, facial expressions and changes in gaze direction.However, it's probably just one part of a larger brain network involved in recognising others through motion.Real-world applicationsMotion-based identity traits aren't as stable or specific as fingerprints or DNA. They're what researchers call soft biometrics: useful but not always accurate.But as we better understand the link between motion and identity, exciting real-world applications are emerging.Motion analysis could support contactless identity verification from gait-based authentication at airports to gesture-based identification in smart environments, such as homes that respond to a user's unique movement patterns. In clinical settings, movement analysis might help support people with social cognition impairments, face recognition or movement issues. For example, helping a doctor identify changes in the way a patient produces non-verbal cues.But many questions remain. We still aren't sure how consistent motion fingerprints are as someone gets older and in different contexts. Individual differences in people and environmental factors like lighting, clothing or stress could affect them.Researchers also aren't sure how exactly we manage to understand all this movement in everyday life without even thinking about it.Figuring this out could not only help improve technologies like social robots and develop tools for people with recognition and communication difficulties, but also tell us more about how we process and react to other people.

Q. When can high beams legally be used?

Driving in the UAE after sunset without proper headlights is both unlawful and dangerous. Motorists are required by law to use their vehicle’s lights between sunset and sunrise and during poor visibility conditions, such as fog and heavy rain. Failure to follow these rules not only risks lives, but also attracts steep penalties and black points on the driver’s licence.Driving without your headlights after sunset, or during low visibility such as heavy rain and fog, constitutes a traffic violation under UAE law. Police actively enforce these rules to keep roads safer. The official penalty for driving without headlights is a Dh500 fine and four black points on your licence, rising to a Dh400 fine and six black points for defective or broken headlights.Headlights aren’t just about keeping your own view clear. Their primary function is to ensure your vehicle is visible to other road users, thereby preventing accidents and collisions. Ignoring this requirement jeopardizes not just the driver, but everyone else on the road.High beams let motorists see farther and are crucial on unlit highways and extremely dark stretches. According to the Dubai Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), they can be safely used only:However, using high beams carelessly, like flashing them at oncoming vehicles or failing to dip them when approaching another car from behind, can blind other drivers and lead to accidents.Drivers are advised to switch to low beams as soon as another vehicle comes into sight, and always dip the lights when following another car.Proper use of headlights is mandatory in the UAE both for safety and compliance. Always ensure your headlights are working and adhere to the law to avoid fines and black points, and only use high beams in appropriate situations to safeguard your own journey and everyone else's.Headlights must be switched on between sunset and sunrise, and during any low-visibility situations such as heavy rain, fog, or dust storms.Driving without headlights at night leads to a Dh500 fine and four black points on your licence.You will incur a Dh400 fine and six black points if caught driving with non-functioning or defective headlights.Aftermarket Xenon headlights are banned.

What’s next?

Partial Lunar Eclipse: July 6, 2028 — a portion of the Moon will pass through Earth’s shadow

Next Total Lunar Eclipse visible from UAE: December 31, 2028 — coinciding with New Year’s Eve, offering another spectacular display

A dramatic and unusually long total lunar eclipse will light up the skies above the UAE on the night of September 7, 2025, turning the Moon a deep red during an 82-minute totality — one of the longest such events in recent years. The eclipse, visible across much of the globe, will offer residents and global viewers a rare chance to witness a breathtaking astronomical display, with public events and global livestreams planned.On September 7, 2025, the UAE will experience a total lunar eclipse, an event in which the Earth positions itself precisely between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow fully across the lunar surface. This alignment causes the Moon to turn a red, copper, or orange hue — a phenomenon popularly known as the Blood Moon.This reddish color results from sunlight being refracted through Earth's atmosphere, which filters out shorter blue wavelengths and allows the longer red tones to reach the Moon’s surface.What makes this eclipse especially notable is the length of totality, lasting a full 82 minutes, and the overall eclipse duration of nearly five and a half hours, one of the longest in recent memory. According to the Dubai Astronomy Group (DAG), the event is not only rare for its duration but also for its global visibility, potentially viewable by 87% of the world’s population.The lunar eclipse will unfold gradually through several distinct phases. Each stage offers a different visual experience, and residents in the UAE will be able to observe the entire sequence clearly:The most visually dramatic moment, totality, will occur between 9:30 PM and 10:53 PM, when the Moon is fully engulfed in Earth’s umbra and glows with intense red shades depending on atmospheric conditions.For the public, the Dubai Astronomy Group will organize a special viewing event in Dubai, allowing residents and tourists to gather and witness the phenomenon together. Details about the event venue and activities are expected to be announced soon. A standout moment will be a carefully planned photo opportunity: a Blood Moon rising behind the Burj Khalifa, captured in collaboration with renowned photographer Rami Dibo.To ensure global accessibility, DAG will also host a livestream of the full eclipse. The broadcast will feature:This global streaming effort aims to bring together astronomy enthusiasts worldwide for a shared celestial experience.Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are safe to view with the naked eye — no protective glasses or filters are needed. However, for those wanting an enhanced viewing experience, DAG recommends the following:If you miss this eclipse, there are a few more chances in the coming years:","On September 7, 2025, the UAE will witness an 82-minute total lunar eclipse, turning the Moon a vivid red.

Dubai Police has taken a significant leap in modernising public services by opening a new Smart Police Station (SPS) in Dragon Mart. With this move, Dubai further strengthens its status as a global leader in AI-driven governance, offering residents and visitors 24/7 access to fully automated, human-free policing services—now across 27 locations.Smart Police Stations (SPS) are a first-of-their-kind innovation in the Middle East. These self-service, unmanned stations operate entirely without physical police personnel. Accessible 24/7, they provide a fast, contactless, and secure alternative to traditional policing setups.Each SPS enables users to complete essential police services digitally—via a simple, secure process that begins with ID verification using either an Emirates ID (for residents) or a passport (for visitors), followed by mobile number authentication via SMS. For services requiring interaction, users are connected through a video interface to an on-duty officer, with on-site access to facilities like scanners and printers to complete paperwork.Once a transaction is completed, users receive a reference number via SMS and receipt, allowing for easy tracking as requests are routed to the appropriate police departments for further action.Services are accessible in seven languages—Arabic, English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, and Chinese—reflecting Dubai’s multicultural population and making processes user-friendly for both locals and international visitors.Dubai’s SPSs offer a broad suite of 45 fully digital services, organised under four main categories:Since launching the world’s first SPS in City Walk in 2017, Dubai has continuously expanded its smart policing infrastructure. The network now includes 27 fully operational SPS locations—ranging from central commercial areas to suburban and residential districts.In 2018, a walk-in model of SPS was introduced at Arabian Ranches to expand accessibility. By 2023, plans were set in motion for a floating SPS at the World Islands, showcasing the innovative trajectory of Dubai’s policing model.Dubai’s SPS framework has drawn global attention, with police commanders from several countries studying its implementation as a future model for digitised public security services.The SPS initiative directly supports the UAE’s national artificial intelligence strategy, which aims to future-proof government systems, increase digital readiness, and enhance public service efficiency.Under the directives of Lieutenant General Abdullah Khalifa Al Marri, Commander-in-Chief of Dubai Police, the rollout of smart police stations is being actively expanded to cover commercial and residential zones across the emirate.Major General Khalid Nasser Al Razooqi, Director of the General Department of Artificial Intelligence at Dubai Police, emphasised that these smart centres are a critical part of Dubai’s vision to become the world’s smartest city. He noted that digital transactions now account for 89.6% of all police service interactions—a testament to public adoption and operational efficiency.","Dubai Police has taken a significant leap in modernising public services by opening a new Smart Police Station (SPS) in Dragon Mart.

Britain agrees to drop mandate for Apple to provide 'back door',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-agrees-to-drop-mandate-for-apple-to-provide-back-door/articleshow/123395824.cms,"Representative Image





SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain dropped a request for Apple to create a tool to give law enforcement access to customers' cloud data.

A chatty parrot with a knack for drug slang has helped British police crack down on a prison drug ring, squawking its way into an unlikely role in a major narcotics bust, authorities revealed this week.The Lancashire Constabulary filed charges against 15 individuals connected to the gang, which purportedly distributed drugs across Blackpool, England, from February 2023 to July 2024. The operation was orchestrated by 35-year-old Adam Garnett whilst serving a prison sentence, Fox News reported.The case unfolded after prison staff discovered multiple mobile phones and Wi-Fi routers during a search of Garnett's cell. This finding led investigators to his alleged associates, including Dalbir Sandhu, Shannon Hilton and Jason Gerrand.Subsequent home searches revealed heroin, crack cocaine, ketamine, cannabis, substantial cash amounts and mobile phones connected to drug trafficking A notable discovery came from Hilton's phone, containing recordings of her parrot ""Mango"" repeating ""two for 25,"" believed to be drug transaction terminology.Additional footage showed the bird interacting with money allegedly obtained through illegal activities.Video:""What's the most talented thing your pet can do? Sit? Give paw? How about speak?"" Lancashire Police wrote in a post on the department's Facebook page.""One drug dealer's parrot learned to say 'two for 25' - a phrase picked up as part of common language used by the organised crime gang run by her boyfriend. Not a phrase you want your parrot squawking when the police come knocking!""Investigators uncovered video communications between Hilton and Garnett, including footage displaying kilogram-sized cocaine packages, occasionally accompanied by drug-referencing song lyrics.Despite his imprisonment, Garnett reportedly maintained central control, directing evidence concealment efforts and maintaining communication with virtually all network members.Det. Sgt. Anthony Alves of Lancashire Police's West Targeted Crime Team commended the results, describing it as a ""coordinated and complex drug operation that extended far beyond prison walls.""""Garnett continued to run his enterprise while incarcerated, using illegal devices to maintain control. I want to thank my team, our partners at the Crown Prosecution Service, and our prosecution team for their dedication to bringing these criminals to justice.""He noted that warrants remain active for Chloe Stott and Ryan Black, requesting public assistance in locating them.Police reported additional evidence from suspects' devices included videos displaying large cash sums, drug-themed rap lyrics and documented narcotic transactions.Garnett received an additional 19 years and six months imprisonment, consecutive to his existing 15-year sentence. Hilton, 29, received 12 years whilst Sandhu, 41, was given 10 years.The operation formed part of Operation Warrior, Lancashire Police's initiative targeting organised crime, drug trafficking, exploitation and violence. Police and Crime Commissioner Clive Grunshaw supported the initiative and praised the results.""This sends a clear message: we will not tolerate organized crime in our communities. I remain committed to giving law enforcement the resources they need to take down these gangs and protect the public.""",A chatty parrot with a knack for drug slang has helped British police crack down on a prison drug ring.

Walls Closing In? Meghan Markle Faces Royal Cold Shoulder Amid New Fears: Reports

Anderson’s calm response

What critics say about Markle’s show

Positive buzz for Anderson

No reaction from Meghan





Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series. The former Baywatch star spoke about the issue on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. When Cohen asked her to rate, on a scale of one to ten, how much Markle’s With Love, Meghan looked like her own Pamela’s Cooking With Love, Anderson answered “One.” She added, “I didn’t invent cooking shows. She’s just doing her thing.”Fans noticed that both shows feature garden scenes, casual kitchen chats, and celebrity guests. Anderson’s trailer came out in October 2024. Markle’s teaser followed three months later. Online threads pointed to similar camera angles and even matching font styles in the titles. Some viewers accused the Duchess of releasing a “frame-for-frame” copy.Pamela’s Cooking With Love is streamed on Amazon Prime. Episodes show Anderson and a guest chef picking vegetables in her Vancouver garden before cooking a meal outdoors. Markle’s eight-part Netflix show centres on simple dishes and home-grown produce in Montecito.Both series mix recipes with lifestyle tips, but Anderson stressed that overlap is normal in food television.Anderson told Cohen she had only seen quick clips of Markle’s programme and did not spend time looking for likenesses. She joked that there is room for anyone who wants to share food and stories on screen. Her relaxed tone cooled much of the online debate.With Love, Meghan drew mixed-to-negative reviews (≈38% on Rotten Tomatoes; 37 on Metacritic). It briefly entered Netflix’s Top 10 in its first week, and mid-year engagement tallies cited by several outlets place it outside Netflix’s Top 300. Even so, Netflix has ordered Season 2.Anderson’s series has earned strong notices and a high user score on IMDb. Executive producer Jesse Fawcett said any comparison is a compliment because it proves their team set a trend others want to follow. Anderson plans to film a second garden season next spring.Markle has not commented on Anderson’s remarks. Sources close to her say she is focused on shooting new episodes and expanding her As Ever lifestyle brand. Observers doubt she will address copy-cat talk directly. They note she has stayed silent through similar critiques from Martha Stewart and Gwyneth Paltrow.Two stars can host cooking shows without a feud. Anderson’s light answer suggests she sees no threat. Unless Markle fires back, the story may cool as fast as it boiled up. For viewers, the choice is simple: prime-time garden meals with Pamela or California comfort food with Meghan. Either way, dinner is served.",Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This method is particularly beneficial for those with mobility issues.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114942014,imgsize-53514,width-400,resizemode-4/114942014.jpg"
"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.
