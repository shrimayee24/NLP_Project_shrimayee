What Wisconsin shooter Natalie Rupnow wrote in her 'War against Humanity' manifesto,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wisconsin-shooter-war-against-humanity/articleshow/116407685.cms,"The Wisconsin shooter wrote her grievances in an alleged manifesto titled 'War against Humanity'

Content of the Manifesto



Familial and Social Alienation: Rupnow described a profound sense of emotional neglect and rejection from her family, writing that her parents viewed her as a “mistake they never wanted.” She portrayed herself as an outsider both at home and at school, writing, “They look at me but don’t see me. I am invisible until I do something they can’t ignore.” Rupnow's resentment toward her classmates was equally evident; she accused peers of ridiculing her differences and isolating her further, describing them as “part of the disease called humanity.”

I am invisible until I do something they can’t ignore.” Rupnow's resentment toward her classmates was equally evident; she accused peers of ridiculing her differences and isolating her further, describing them as “part of the disease called humanity.” Hatred for So ciety: A recurring theme throughout the manifesto is Rupnow’s disdain for societal norms and values. She criticized societal expectations, consumerism, and what she called “false morality,” blaming humanity for creating a world of cruelty, hypocrisy, and exploitation. She referred to herself as “a soldier against the plague of mankind.”

She criticized societal expectations, consumerism, and what she called “false morality,” blaming humanity for creating a world of cruelty, hypocrisy, and exploitation. She referred to herself as “a soldier against the plague of mankind.” Retribution and Power: Rupnow justified her actions as a “final statement” against a world that she believed had failed her. She wrote, “If the world doesn’t care that I exist, it will care when I don’t.” The shooting, according to her writings, was an attempt to reclaim control over her life, which she described as dominated by feelings of powerlessness.

She wrote, “If the world doesn’t care that I exist, it will care when I don’t.” The shooting, according to her writings, was an attempt to reclaim control over her life, which she described as dominated by feelings of powerlessness. Suicidal Ideation with a Twist: While Rupnow had contemplated suicide for years, she expressed a desire to make her death “mean something.” She rejected the idea of dying quietly and wrote, “A life wasted in silence is a death that changes nothing. I want them to remember me, to feel what I felt.”

Social Media Activity and Warnings



Disturbing Content: Over the months leading up to the attack, her posts increasingly featured themes of death, revenge, and societal collapse. Images of firearms, violent memes, and nihilistic quotes were frequent. She shared captions like “The quiet ones always strike the loudest” and “I’m not broken—I’m what you made me.”

She shared captions like “The quiet ones always strike the loudest” and “I’m not broken—I’m what you made me.” Manifesto Teasers: Investigators have noted that Rupnow dropped hints about her manifesto in cryptic posts. Phrases like “The countdown has begun” and “They’ll know what I mean when the time comes” appeared shortly before the attack. These posts, while ominous in retrospect, were largely dismissed at the time as dark teenage musings.

She often posted about feeling unseen and unheard, writing, “I am a shadow, but I will make them see.” Friends and followers reportedly noticed a shift in her tone weeks before the attack, describing her posts as “angrier and colder than usual.”

Manifesto Insights: Her Motivations



Feelings of Rejection: Her sense of alienation—both at home and in school—formed the core of her bitterness. She wrote of being unloved, unseen, and unwanted.

Desire for Control: Her writings reveal an obsession with taking back control in a life where she felt powerless. Violence, she believed, would give her “the voice [she] never had.”

Red Flags and Missed Warnings



The Aftermath



In the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin , a disturbing document titled ""War Against Humanity"" has emerged, reportedly authored by 15-year-old Natalie ""Samantha"" Rupnow. This alleged manifesto, along with evidence from her social media activity and personal writings, sheds light on her motivations, mental state, and the warning signs that went unnoticed in the lead-up to the attack.The alleged ""War Against Humanity"" manifesto is an unsettling, multi-page document filled with grievances, dark reflections, and ominous declarations. The manifesto reveals not only deep personal struggles but also a deliberate and premeditated justification for her violent actions.Rupnow’s social media presence painted a chilling picture of her mindset leading up to the shooting. Her accounts, mostly private or pseudonymous, were littered with troubling posts, dark imagery, and cryptic messages that hinted at her escalating despair.Rupnow’s writings, paired with her online behavior, point to a toxic mix of personal grievances, anger, and existential despair that fueled her actions:In hindsight, the warning signs were clear but tragically ignored. Her dark and violent social media posts, cryptic writings, and noticeable changes in behavior were dismissed by friends and family as teenage angst. Investigators are examining whether anyone knew of Rupnow’s plans and failed to report her behavior. School officials and counselors have since been criticized for failing to identify her struggles. Peers who were aware of her disturbing posts reportedly felt uncomfortable but did not raise concerns.As the Madison community mourns the devastating loss of life, the “War Against Humanity” manifesto serves as a stark reminder of the importance of recognizing warning signs and addressing teenage mental health struggles. Rupnow’s writings and actions underscore the consequences of unchecked isolation, unaddressed trauma, and a failure to intervene when red flags emerge. Law enforcement and educators have called for greater awareness of social media behaviors, urging families to pay closer attention to troubling content and shifts in emotional well-being. The investigation continues, but the tragedy has left a haunting question: How could these signs have been missed, and what more could have been done to prevent such unthinkable violence?","Rupnow described a profound sense of emotional neglect and rejection from her family, writing that her parents viewed her as a “mistake they never wanted” She portrayed herself as an outsider both at home and at school, writing, “They look at me but don’t see me.” Rupnow's resentment toward her classmates was equally evident; she accused peers of ridiculing her differences and isolating her further, describing them as “part of the disease called humanity”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116407871,imgsize-1373840,width-400,resizemode-4/116407871.jpg"
LA Lakers trade rumor: Insider identifies $41.9 million Brooklyn Nets duo as potential targets for LeBron James' Los Angeles Lakers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/la-lakers-trade-rumor-insider-identifies-41-9-million-brooklyn-nets-duo-as-potential-targets-for-lebron-james-los-angeles-lakers/articleshow/116410151.cms,"LeBron James of Lakers (Image via Getty)

Los Angeles Lakers

“Brooklyn is expected to make wings Cam Johnson ($22.5 million but with a likely cap hit of $27 million) and Dorian Finney-Smith ($14.9 million) available — and much sooner than the Feb. 6 deadline. Both have been tied to the Lakers for months. The Lakers have been interested in Finney-Smith for at least a couple of years,”

“Cam Johnson and Dorian Finney-Smith are names to watch for the Lakers, per @jovanbuha.”

Theare reportedly trying to get two key Brooklyn Nets players under their franchise as the NBA trade deadline approaches. With the team currently holding a playoff spot in the Western Conference, Lakers management appears eager to make their roster stronger around LeBron James and Anthony Davis. According to insider Jovan Buha, the Lakers have their eyes on Nets’ wings Cam Johnson and Dorian Finney-Smith, whose combined contracts total approximately $41.9 million.As the February 6 trade deadline draws closer, the Brooklyn Nets have become one of the league’s most active sellers. The franchise has already begun putting talented players up for trade. Their most recently trade was that of Dennis Schroder to the Golden State Warriors for expiring contracts and draft capital. Johnson and Finney-Smith are the next names expected to generate significant trade interest.Buha reported.The Lakers’ desire for roster upgrades follows an offseason where no major moves were made. This has placed pressure on General Manager Rob Pelinka to strengthen the team as they prepare for a highly competitive playoff push.Of the two trade targets, Cam Johnson stands out as a potentially game-changing addition. Currently in the midst of a career-best season, Johnson is averaging 18.6 points per game and shooting 43.3 percent from beyond the arc. His role as a three-and-D wing would provide much-needed floor spacing for LeBron and Davis, offering them a reliable kick-out option on the perimeter. Johnson’s shooting efficiency would be a significant asset for a Lakers team that has struggled with consistent offensive production.Dorian Finney-Smith offers a different but equally valuable defensive skill set. He’s averaging 11.0 points and 4.3 rebounds per game this season while shooting an impressive 45.0 percent from three on six attempts per game. His ability to guard multiple positions makes him a key defensive asset. Finney-Smith’s experience playing alongside star talent like Luka Doncic during his time with the Dallas Mavericks has demonstrated his ability to thrive in supporting roles.The potential addition of Johnson and Finney-Smith is similar to the strategy that helped the Lakers secure the 2020 NBA Championship. That title run was built on surrounding LeBron and Davis with talented support players. The pursuit of these two Brooklyn wings signals a return to that successful blueprint. While Johnson and Finney-Smith may not be the flashiest names on the trade market, they represent the type of players who can help the Lakers compete in a stacked Western Conference.Also read: Top 30 most valuable NBA teams of 2024 NBA fans and media have taken notice of the Lakers’ rumored interest in the Brooklyn duo. A tweet from NBACentral highlighted the growing buzz, stating,With the trade deadline approaching, speculation will only continue to grow about whether the Lakers can pull off a deal to land one or both of these impact players.","The Los Angeles Lakers are reportedly trying to get two key Brooklyn Nets players under their franchise as the NBA trade deadline approaches.

No Yes

SANTOSH | Official Trailer

India's road to the Oscars has been a bumpy one. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) on Wednesday unveiled its shortlist of films (10 categories) still in the running for the Oscars 2025 . Sadly for India, The Kiran Rao directorial ' Laapataa Ladies ', which was the country's official entry to the Best Foreign Language Film category, was out of the race.The film which beat out Payal Kapadia 's ' All We Imagine As Light ' to be selected as India's entry, sadly didn't make the cut. However, another Hindi language film titled 'Santosh' found a spot in the ' Best International Feature Film ' category.There among the 15 films that were shortlisted for the Oscars out of 85 total films submitted, was this Sandhya Suri directorial which was the United Kingdom's official submission for the Academy Awards 2025 . The movie also premiered at the 77th Cannes Film Festival in May 2024, and was well-received by critics.The film's official synopsis reads, ""Ripped from her life of domesticity, Santosh, a young widow now desperate to support herself, accepts an opportunity to inherit her husband’s job as a police officer in the rural badlands of India. Quickly taken under the wing of Sharma, a charismatic and commanding older female inspector, Santosh begins an investigation into a low-caste girl’s brutal murder that plunges her into a gritty world of crime and corruption, forcing her to confront not only the brokenness of the system around her, but her own place within it.""The film stars Shahana as the driven young Hindu widow who finds herself caught up in institutional corruption. The film also stars Sunita Rajwar as the rough-edged veteran detective Inspector Sharma, inspecting the brutal murder of a Dalit girl.Reacting to this ""little glory"", Shahana took to Instagram and expressed her happiness in a post that read, ""So happy for the team especially our writer-director Sandhya Suri for this little glory of recognition for our film Santosh! How incredible to be shortlisted from amongst 85 films. Thank you to everyone who loved it, supported it and voted for it.""The film's production house also congratulated the team in a post that read, ""Congrats to Sandhya Suri and the entire #Santosh team on making the shortlist for the 97th Academy Awards' Best Int'l Feature category! SANTOSH opens NYC's @IFCCenter Dec 27th! ""The films still in the running to score an Oscar nomination for Best International Feature are as follows:'Armand"" from Norway'Dahomey' from Senegal'Emilia Perez' from France'Flow' from Latvia'From Ground Zero' from Palestine'The Girl With the Needle' from Denmark'How to Make Millions before Grandma Dies' from Thailand'I'm Still Here' from Brazil'Kneecap' from Ireland'Santosh' from United Kingdom'The Seed of the Sacred Fig' from Germany'Touch' from Iceland'Universal Language' from Canada'Waves' from Czech Republic'Vermiglio' from ItalyThe list includes films that are officially eligible to compete in various categories. However, it does not guarantee that these films will advance to the final nominations for the Academy Awards.Speaking to Popcorn Pixel, director Suri revealed that her film was not based on a true story, but was rather a fictionalised take on the subject of violence against women. ""It was the way as a documentary filmmaker to talk about violence against women and finding it very difficult to speak openly and honestly, "" she told the portal.She also went on to reveal why she chose a police's POV for her film, ""Then seeing in 2012 after the horrible case in Delhi on the bus, of seeing a police officer in the crowd with female protesters and thinking that actually a very interesting example of looking at violence. Because she can also meet it out, but experience it as a woman.""Reacting to the news, Indian fans expressed their shock saying, ""Lmao not only did LAPATAA LADIES not make it, but the other Hindi movie, Sandhya Suri’s SANTOSH did.""Another said, ""Laapata Ladies is not short listed for the best international feature by @TheAcademy but Sandhya Suri’s UK-backed Santosh has made the list.""'Laapataa Ladies' selection as India's official entry to the Oscars was mired in controversy. While the film won critical acclaim, many were of the opinion that the Payal Kapadia directorial 'All We Imagine As Light' would have been a better pick, considering its historic success at Cannes. The film was rejected by the selection committee as it allegedly 'wasn't Indian enough'. The film has since gone on to score Critics Choice Awards and even Golden Globe nominations.Oscar voting to determine the nominees in all 23 categories will start on Wednesday, January 8, and it will end on Sunday, January 12.

The supposed one-off appearance became permanent, and the strip would be renamed ""Popeye"".But as with Mickey Mouse last year and Winnie the Pooh in 2022, only the earliest version is free for reuse.

So was director Steven Spielberg's ""Adventures of Tintin"" in 2011. But the comics about the boy reporter that inspired it, the creation of Belgian artist Herge, were among the most popular in Europe for much of the 20th century.The simply drawn teen with dots for eyes and bangs like an ocean wave first appeared in a supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingtieme Siecle, and became a weekly feature. The comic also first appeared in the US in 1929. Its signature bright colours - including Tintin's red hair - didn't appear until years later, and could, like Popeye's spinach, be the subject of legal disputes. And in much of the world, Tintin won't become public property until 70 years after the 1983 death of his creator.The books becoming public this year read like syllabus for an American literature seminar.

Is Netflix over Harry and Meghan? 'Exhausted' execs pin hopes on Sussexes’ cookery show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/is-netflix-over-harry-and-meghan-exhausted-execs-pin-hopes-on-sussexes-cookery-show/articleshow/116359484.cms,"As per the sources, Netflix executives are “exhausted” from working with Markle.

Polo flops and “box office poison” drama

Cookery show under pressure

The Sussex struggle: From Hollywood darlings to “colossal bombs”

Crisis control or end of the road?

It seems like the honeymoon phase between Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, and Netflix is officially over. Once hailed as the streaming platform’s dream duo, the Sussexes’ partnership with Netflix has hit a rough patch, with insiders whispering about mounting frustration and dwindling faith in their ability to deliver hits.The latest debacle? Their five-part documentary about polo, which critics have torched as a “tedious inside look” and a “dull indulgence.” One reviewer even joked it felt like a spoof designed to play in the background of Succession.As per the sources quoted by the Daily Mail, Netflix executives are “exhausted” from working with Markle. The fallout is apparently so bad that her upcoming cookery show—still without a premiere date—is being labeled as her “make or break” moment. “It’s so much work with her, and, bluntly, the ‘deliverable’ does not seem to be worth it,” one insider said.Adding fuel to the fire, there’s been zero buzz around the polo series. No press tours, no promotional events, no hype. Even Nacho Figueras, Harry’s polo pal and a star of the series, has barely mentioned it on social media. Hollywood veteran Sean McNulty told The Daily Beast: “The lack of a proper press campaign for a Harry and Meghan project is eyebrow-raising, to say the least.”According to reports, Meghan’s cookery show is now the Sussexes’ last hope at staying in Netflix’s good graces. One entertainment exec was quotes by the Daily Mail as saying, “Her show will have to be an enormous hit to turn around their deal and their reputations in this town.”The show is expected to drop in early 2024, coinciding with Harry’s appearance at the Winter Invictus Games in Canada and the launch of Meghan’s homeware brand, American Riviera Orchard . Talk about multitasking under pressure.Critics are having a field day with Harry and Meghan’s current reputation—or lack thereof. Marketing expert Tony Case didn’t mince words, was quoted by the Daily Beast as saying, “Harry and Meghan are box office poison. Everyone is running away from this colossal bomb.”He added, “They set out to conquer America, but no one here found them—or what they’re selling—to be particularly compelling.”Even their highly-publicized project Meet Me at the Lake, based on a best-selling novel, remains in limbo. With no production in sight, it’s unlikely to materialize before their Netflix deal is up for renewal next year.Friends who once hyped their projects are unusually quiet, fueling speculation that Hollywood may be losing patience with the couple. A source quoted in Closer Magazine tried to defend the Sussexes, blaming Netflix for pushing a “reality TV angle” that was out of their control.","The Sussexes’ partnership with Netflix has hit a rough patch, with insiders whispering about mounting frustration and dwindling faith in their ability to deliver hits. “It’s so much work with her, and, bluntly, the ‘deliverable’ does not seem to be worth it,” one insider said.

A woman in southwestern China won 10,000 yuan (Rs 1, 16,000) from a competition for abstaining from mobile phone use for eight hours while exhibiting no signs of anxiety.The contest took place at a shopping centre in Chongqing municipality on November 29, as reported by Jimu News.Ten contestants, selected from 100 applicants, were invited to the mall to participate in the competition, which required them to spend eight hours on a designated new bed. Before the contest, they surrendered their mobile phones and were prohibited from using any other electronic devices, including iPads and laptops, the South China Morning Post reported.In emergency situations, participants could use older mobile phone models with only calling capabilities, provided by the competition organisers, to contact their families.They were also required to adhere to a bed restriction rule, which allowed them to leave the bed for toilet breaks, but limited them to a maximum of five minutes each time.The organisers set a quota for the total amount of time contestants could be away from their beds throughout the eight-hour period, although this detail was not disclosed in the news report.Drinks and meals were provided, and participants were instructed to consume them in bed.In addition to being prohibited from using their mobile phones, competitors were not allowed to fall into a deep sleep or exhibit anxiety. They wore wrist straps to monitor their sleep quality and anxiety levels.Most contestants spent their time reading books or simply resting with their eyes closed.Ultimately, after verification by event officials, a woman surnamed Dong was declared the champion, achieving a comprehensive score of 88.99 out of 100. The organisers noted that she spent the longest time in bed, did not experience deep sleep, and displayed the lowest level of anxiety.The 10,000-yuan prizewinner donned pyjamas for the competition, earning her the nickname “pyjama sister” on mainland social media as the no-mobile-phone race gained viral attention online.Dong is a sales manager at a finance firm. In her spare time, she typically tutors her child and rarely browses her mobile phone aimlessly.The identity of the company sponsoring the competition and the purpose behind holding this event, which occurred in a mattress and bedding shop within the mall, remains undisclosed.","A woman in southwestern China won 10,000 yuan (Rs 1, 16,000) from a competition for abstaining from mobile phone use for eight hours.

What are balloon blowing kits?

Canada has recently issued a warning asking citizens to abstain from using balloon-blowing kits sold on Amazon as they possess a chemical hazard.“Immediately stop using the affected products and dispose of them according to municipal hazardous waste guidelines,” the health agency cautioned in its advisory released on December 13.The advisory covers several products like a 15 pieces bubble ball toy, burst-free plastic balloon, colorful magic bubble glue, perfect boys and girls gift 202 and others.Health Canada has also stated that Amazon sold 127 units of the affected products in the country between November 2023 and November 2024. As of now, no incidents or injuries related to these products have been reported.The authority revealed that blowing the balloons exposes a child to inhaling the vapours of any solvents present.“If children blow this type of solvent-containing balloon for extended periods, they may experience early symptoms of central nervous system depression or dysfunction, including euphoria, hallucinations, dizziness, and difficulties with co-ordination of voluntary movements,” it further added, “Prolonged exposure can lead to more serious symptoms, including muscular twitching, unconsciousness and coma.”Balloon blowing kits are toys that come with a tube of solvent mixture and short plastic straws. Kids use these straws to create bubbles or balloons by squeezing a small amount of the mixture onto the end of the straw and then blowing through it. The air from the straw forms a bubble, making it a fun activity for children.Previously, the country also issued advisories against these balloon-blowing kits sold via AliExpress.ca, eBay.ca and SHEIN.","Health Canada has issued a warning asking citizens to abstain from using balloon-blowing kits sold on Amazon as they possess a chemical hazard.

An Iranian singer faces prosecution after performing an online concert without a hijab, violating Iran's dress code. The judiciary announced legal action against the singer and production staff on Thursday. The concert was streamed on YouTube and featured the singer, Parastoo Ahmadi , bare-shouldered in a black dress, performing with a three-man band.The concert appears to have been filmed in Iran at a traditional caravanserai. Iranian law requires women to cover their hair in public and prohibits them from singing solo publicly. Ahmadi had previously gained a following on Instagram, posting videos and audio clips of herself singing without a headscarf, often in support of the 2022-2023 protests.A message preceding the concert on YouTube stated: ""I am Parastoo, the girl who cannot remain silent and refuses to stop singing for the country she loves."" She encouraged viewers to ""listen to my voice in this imaginary concert and dream of a free and beautiful nation"".The Iranian judiciary, without naming Ahmadi, stated that legal action was taken against “a group led by a female singer” who performed “music without observing legal and religious standards.”US-based activist Masih Alinejad called the concert “historic,” stating that “her voice is a weapon against tyranny, her courage a song of defiance.” Commentator Karim Sadjadpour described the concert as an “act of extraordinary courage” and “another crack in the foundations of Iran's rotting theocracy.”This event comes before a new law, expected Friday, which rights groups say will increase penalties for women violating the dress code.","Iranian singer Parastoo Ahmadi performs online concert without hijab, faces prosecution.

"'No burgers, soft drinks and burgers': UK bans daytime TV ads for junk food in bid to tackle child obesity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/no-burgers-soft-drinks-and-burgers-uk-bans-daytime-tv-ads-for-junk-food-in-bid-to-tackle-child-obesity/articleshow/116004661.cms,"Rising child obesity in UK

What will be covered in the ambit of the ban?

The UK government has announced a ban on daytime TV adverts for sugary foods, including popular items like granola, muffins, and pastries, as part of its ongoing efforts to combat rising childhood obesity.News agency AFP reported that the new regulations, set to take effect in October next year, will restrict ads for “less healthy” food and drinks to airing only after the 9:00 pm watershed.The ban targets specific products identified as unhealthy based on their sugar, fat, and salt content, but does not apply to the broader advertising of fast food chains. For example, ads from fast food restaurants will remain permissible as long as they do not feature specific items like burgers or fries, according to a BBC report.Highlighting the importance of these measures, health secretary Wes Streeting said, “Obesity robs our kids of the best possible start in life, sets them up for a lifetime of health problems, and costs the NHS billions. This government is taking action now to end the targeting of junk food ads at kids, across both TV and online.”According to the National Health Service (NHS), obesity rates among children in the UK are on the rise, with one in 10 four-year-olds now classified as obese. Additionally, one in five five-year-olds suffers from tooth decay linked to excessive sugar consumption. The government’s new approach aims to address these alarming statistics and prevent further health complications down the line.The ban includes a variety of items that are commonly marketed to children, such as fast food, soft drinks, ready meals, and pre-packaged sugary breakfast foods. Products like croissants, pancakes, waffles, cereal bars, and sweetened yoghurts will be affected, alongside chickpea or lentil-based crisps, seaweed snacks, energy drinks, and processed foods like hamburgers and chicken nuggets.However, healthier alternatives will be exempt from the restrictions. Natural porridge oats and unsweetened yoghurt, for instance, will not fall under the new rules.The government hopes that by reducing the exposure of children to these adverts, it can help prevent an estimated 20,000 cases of childhood obesity each year.","The UK government has announced a ban on daytime TV adverts for sugary foods.

Shared love for animals

Middleton family’s competitive spirit

Prince William has revealed a unique way to avoid the ""fiercely competitive"" atmosphere of the Middleton family's game nights, taking James Middleton 's beloved dog, Ella, for a walk.As noted in James’ book, ‘Meet Ella: The Dog Who Saved My Life’, Ella offered the Prince of Wales the perfect excuse to step away from the fast-paced card game Racing Demon.James wrote, “Ella gave him a perfect excuse to avoid the fiercely competitive atmosphere of the Middleton household, especially during our favourite fast-paced card game, Racing Demon.”Royal expert Christopher Andersen echoed this sentiment, saying that William and Kate Middleton’s card games are “intense and all-consuming,” often prompting William to look for ways to steer clear of the competitive streak that runs deep in the Middleton family.However, away from these heated games, William reportedly has no hesitation in challenging Kate in private competitions.As per RadarOnline, James Middleton shared insights on The Dog podcast, describing William’s lighthearted approach to the family games. He noted that William would often ask, “James, does Ella need a walk?” before the game even began, much to the knowing amusement of the Middleton siblings.James wrote in his memoir that William, despite his rigorous military training, was ""thrilled to be the first out of the game"" and would happily retreat to cuddle Ella once eliminated.William’s affection for animals has been a longstanding trait.According to People.com, William grew up surrounded by dogs and shared this love with his late grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and his maternal grandmother, Frances Shand Kydd.While William hesitated to get another dog after losing a beloved pet in his youth, Kate encouraged him to welcome Lupo, a black cocker spaniel, into their family in 2011.The Wales family welcomed a new cocker spaniel named Orla in 2020. James Middleton bred the dog. This followed the death of their previous dog, Lupo.James reflected on how William has become an integral part of the Middleton family, telling People that the Prince has been “fantastic in offering advice and support” and fully embraces his role as both a family member and future king.James added, “William has no qualms about taking part in our family traditions , even if he’s more comfortable cheering from the sidelines.”Christopher Andersen, speaking to Fox News Digital, explained that competition runs deep in royal and Middleton families alike.He noted that the late Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip enjoyed spirited contests, while King Charles III’s passion for polo often led to injuries.However, the Middleton family’s drive to win appears unmatched. James confirmed this sentiment, adding that his paternal grandmother would ""thrash"" them at Racing Demon well into her eighties.Kate, who shares her family’s love for games, also highlighted this competitive spirit in a touching September video about completing her chemotherapy. In the message, she revealed how playing card games with her family had provided moments of normalcy during her recovery.Despite the high-energy dynamic of these gatherings, William’s bond with his in-laws remains strong.As James Middleton shared with Hello! magazine, “William has been fantastic in integrating into our family, and we’re proud to have him as part of our lives.”","Prince William has revealed a unique way to avoid the ""fiercely competitive"" atmosphere of the Middleton family's game nights.

2. Vyvanse: Adderall’s More Polished Cousin



Why They Love It: Vyvanse doesn’t hit you like a freight train, but it keeps you focused for hours, ideal for analyzing endless financial models.

The Catch: It’s still amphetamines. You might look less twitchy, but that doesn’t make it any safer.

3. Zyn Nicotine Pouches: The Bro-Tastic Lip Fix



Banker Party Trick: Double-pouching for “maximum buzz.”

Decorative Uses: Building Zyn pyramids on desks. Because finance bros will turn anything into a flex, even their vices.

Side Effects: You smell like a Marlboro plant, but at least your gums are buzzing like the NASDAQ during a bull market.

4. Monsterbombs: Fuel for the Soulless



Recipe for Chaos: Monster + 5-Hour Energy = the caffeine equivalent of five cups of coffee in one gulp.

Why Do This? Because caffeine pills are for amateurs, and cold brew isn’t hardcore enough.

Fun Side Effect: Shaky hands while you try to reconcile discrepancies in a billion-dollar merger.

5. Street Adderall: Desperation Has No Bounds



Why It’s Risky: Counterfeit Adderall has been found laced with fentanyl.

Why They Do It Anyway: Because missing a deadline might feel worse than dying (to them).

The Ultimate Irony: Taking an unregulated pill while wearing $1,000 loafers.

Final Act: The Burnout Chronicles



In Martin Scorsese’s, Leonardo DiCaprio’s Jordan Belfort is powered by enough cocaine to fuel a small nation, Quaaludes that turn his legs into spaghetti, and a pharmacy of other party drugs that keep him speeding through his high-flying (and wildly illegal) financial escapades. It’s excess, chaos, and debauchery—a blistering caricature of Wall Street in the ’80s and ’90s. Fast-forward to today, and while Wall Street might be less about dwarf-tossing and yachts, it’s still running on chemicals.Only now, the drugs have swapped champagne-soaked hedonism for hyper-productivity. Today’s Wall Street warriors aren’t popping Quaaludes to get high—they’re crushing Adderall to stay awake. The parties have been replaced by pitch decks, and the only lines most junior bankers are doing are made of crushed amphetamines on the desk of their bullpen cubicle.Because if you thought surviving a Scorsese-esque Wall Street required a strong constitution, today’s young investment bankers are trying to thrive in a world where every minute is billable, every email a test of loyalty, and every financial model a make-or-break moment for a $5 billion merger.Here’s the modern lineup of performance-enhancing substances that power these spreadsheet samurais through their 90-hour weeks. It’s Wall Street on drugs—just not the kind you were expecting.If cocaine was the drug of choice for yuppies in the ’80s, Adderall is the 21st-century successor—a stimulant that transforms droopy-eyed interns into PowerPoint Picassos. For today’s young analysts, it’s not about the rush; it’s about the focus. Need to format a 120-slide deck perfectly before the client call at 8 a.m.? Adderall. Have to make sure every comma in a $10 billion deal is placed just so? Adderall.One former banker described Adderall as the “financial version of Captain America’s serum.” Too bad it also makes you forget your friends' birthdays and your own humanity.For those who find Adderall too “intense,” there’s Vyvanse—the smoother, longer-lasting cousin. It’s like drinking cold brew instead of espresso: less jittery, but it still gets the job done. Vyvanse is for the marathoners, the ones prepping for the two-day pitch sprint where sleep is considered an optional luxury.Over time, even Vyvanse users hit a wall. One banker recalled popping pills just to stay awake for a 20-hour day, then realizing that his “big win” was formatting a spreadsheet no one would remember a week later.Who needs cigarettes when you can have Zyn? These little nicotine pouches are all the rage among bankers who think stimulants are great but want something that also lets them chew on PowerPoint errors.One Houston analyst joked that Zyn was like a “chewable promotion strategy.” Considering his caffeine intake, his gums probably deserve hazard pay.Think Red Bull is extreme? Meet the Monsterbomb—a monstrous concoction made by dropping a 5-Hour Energy shot into a can of Monster Energy and slamming it like a fraternity dare. It’s the unofficial drink of junior bankers who need to hit impossible deadlines while their hearts try not to implode.One Houston banker said, “It’s like drinking a heart attack, but at least you’ll finish the model on time.”When there’s a nationwide shortage of ADHD meds, Wall Street bros don’t just shrug and accept it—they find their fix wherever they can. Enter the underground Adderall market, where counterfeit pills are just a text message away.Sure, these drugs keep Wall Street’s hamster wheel turning, but the price is steep. From ruined personal lives to permanent dependencies, today’s bankers are proving that the grind never ends—it just changes its chemical composition.So while the cocaine-and-Quaalude-fueled insanity of The Wolf of Wall Street is a thing of the past, the underlying theme remains: If you want to make it big on Wall Street, you’d better be ready to sacrifice your health, sanity, and soul—all in pursuit of the next big deal.",Today’s Wall Street warriors aren’t popping Quaaludes to get high. They’re crushing Adderall to stay awake. The parties have been replaced by pitch decks. The only lines most junior bankers are doing are made of crushed amphetamines.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116368883,imgsize-57396,width-400,resizemode-4/116368883.jpg"

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.

Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

I have no equity in OpenAI.”He also said, “I’m doing this because I love it.”Elon Musk reshared the video with a “raised eyebrow” emoji – that is often used to express skepticism, disbelief or amusement.This is not the first time that Musk has thrown shade at Altman.
