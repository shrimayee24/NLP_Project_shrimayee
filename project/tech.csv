Diddy: 'He’s having 48 hours with Diddy’: Sean Combs' questionable remarks on spending time with 16-year-old Justin Bieber,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hes-having-48-hours-with-diddy-sean-combs-questionable-remarks-on-spending-time-with-16-year-old-justin-bieber/articleshow/113949875.cms,"Jimmy Kimmel interview of P Diddy and Justin Bieber, 2011 (Photo: X)

A 2011 clip featuring Justin Bieber and Sean “Diddy” Combs on American talk show ' Jimmy Kimmel Live !' has resurfaced and garnered attention following Diddy ’s recent arrest for alleged sex trafficking and racketeering . The video shows a young Bieber, then just 16, interacting with the 54-year-old rapper, as host Jimmy Kimmel questions them about their friendship and potential music collaborations.“I think that we have become friends in a strange way,” Combs replied, to which Bieber said, “It’s like Rob & Big,” referencing the late skateboarder Rob Dyrdek and his bodyguard.Combs praised Bieber, saying, “He’s like a little brother” to many in the industry and that they want to protect him because he is “genuinely such a nice person besides his talents.”During the conversation, Kimmel joked, “You know, Diddy bought his son a Bentley; maybe he could buy you one also while you’re at it.” To which Bieber responded, “He got me a Lamborghini. I haven’t gotten it yet, though.”Combs elaborated on the Lamborghini mention, saying, “The Lamborghini for a day or two and he had access to the house. And he knows better than to be talking about the things that he does with big brother Puff on national television. Everything ain’t for everybody.”However, an unsettling exchange in the clip has drawn backlash. Combs said, “He’s having 48 hours with Diddy, where we hanging out and what we’re doing we can’t really disclose,” adding, “But it’s definitely a 15-year-old’s dream.” He claimed to have “custody” of Bieber for that time, saying, “I don’t have legal guardianship of him [Bieber] but for the next 48 hours, he’s with me, and we’re gonna go full crazy.”In a separate video from 2020, Bieber expressed his desire to protect Billie Eilish from the music industry. Speaking with Apple Music ’s Zane Lowe, he reflected on his own experiences as a young artist, sharing, “It was hard for me being that young and being in the industry and not knowing where to turn, and everyone telling me they loved me, and turn their back on you in a second.” He added, “I just want to protect her. I don’t want her to go through anything I went through. I don’t wish that upon anybody.”Bieber described his struggles, saying, “It was bad … it was dark,” and highlighted the psychological toll of his early fame. He hopes to be “a good example” for Eilish, saying, “If she ever needs me, I’m gonna be here for her. I’m just a call away.”Since Diddy’s arrest on September 16, various clips of his extravagant parties have resurfaced, including a 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' segment where Khloe Kardashian recalled encountering Bieber at one of Diddy’s lavish gatherings in 2014, where “half of the guests were naked.”Federal prosecutors have accused Diddy of hosting “freak off” parties where women were lured and forced into sexual performances with male sex workers. The indictment claims these events were recorded, allegedly providing Diddy with material to blackmail his victims. He faces charges of sex trafficking, racketeering, and transportation to engage in prostitution, to which he has pleaded not guilty.Despite the controversy surrounding Diddy, Bieber is focusing on his new role as a father after welcoming his son, Jack Blues, with his wife Hailey Bieber . An insider noted, “He’s aware of Diddy’s arrest and all the allegations. It’s not anything that he wants to focus on, though"", as reported by the New York Times.","A 2011 clip featuring Justin Bieber and Sean ""Diddy"" Combs on American talk show'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' has resurfaced and garnered attention following Diddy’s recent arrest for alleged sex trafficking and racketeering.

She promptly relocated it back onto her property and disposed of it.However, three weeks later, she was startled by another visit from an enforcement officer who presented her with a £500 (Rs 55,571.20) fine for fly-tipping.""I got a knock on the door with a man with an enforcement camera on his chest, telling me he is filming me,"" she said. ""He read the caution speech to me - so that was very nerve-wracking.

She has received an outpouring of support from the local community, with one resident admitting to engaging in similar practices for years without realizing it constituted fly-tipping.Additionally, several local councillors have reached out to Pepin with messages of support.

Princess Diana 's ballet teacher, Anne Allan, has written a book ' Dancing with Diana ', where she explains an early sign of the doomed marriage that she noticed in an incident- among many other recollections. In December 1985, Diana danced to Billy Joel's ""Uptown Girl"" at the Royal Opera House in London. It was meant to be a surprise for Charles, but it became a shock to him, as Charles, according to the writer, did not approve of the princess dancing in a slinky gown without stockings.""She wanted Charles to approve of it,"" Anne told Fox News. Charles' three-word reaction was ""well done, darling."" That was it. He immediately went on to do something else. ""And when you've come offstage and your adrenaline is pumping … you just want somebody to tell you that you're doing all right.""The episode is not unknown. The Season 4 of the Crown on Netflix showed the dance routine and its aftermath.Anne Allan explained that there might be two reasons for Charles' displeasure. One, he's probably not a man who likes surprises; and two, probably he did not like his wife wearing a slinky dress, showing her body. "" I’m not quite sure whether he thought it was the appropriate thing for Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales.""But all that Diana was hoping was to light spark in their marriage.""She just wanted to bring romance into her life, because that’s what she thought it should be. And I know that they had many, many happy times together. . . . She would arrange a nice night . . . and Charles occasionally would do that, too. But he was probably a bit more pragmatic as a person.""""I think she was much more able to see possibility of how romance should be. I’m not sure if that was how Charles was. She loved holding hands, she loved having a cuddle. She was a very affectionate person. It meant a lot to her to have that in her life.""The performance was kept under the wrap till the last moment.""She just thought it would be great fun not telling Charles,"" said Allan. ""She would just appear, and it would be hugely entertaining, and everybody would maybe have a nice time.""""More than anything, she wanted to support her husband,"" said Allan. ""That’s what mattered to her. She loved him dearly, and she just wanted him to shine. . . . When articles became more and more about her, she just said, ‘I do wish they would spend more time photographing Charles than I. I don’t want to make things difficult.’""Princess Diana and Anne eventually developed a friendship, and Diana would frequently seek Anne's counsel. In the book, Diana is quoted expressing her distress over her husband’s affair, saying, ""I know he's seeing Camilla again. Why doesn't he love me? I just can't understand.""""I have tried everything, tried to conform to his wishes even though I don’t always agree. There’s no affection between us, and I am always on my own. I just want to be loved. I can’t keep going on like this. They are really expecting me to just say nothing and keep going. How do I do that?""""Anne, he runs off to Camilla whenever he can. It’s not at all what I want. I’d like the marriage to work, but it just isn’t for now.

Gilded Youth: An Intimate History of Growing Up in the

Royal Family

OK!

Kate Middleton , the Princess of Wales, has become known not only for her grace in public but also for her remarkably effective parenting style. As Prince George , Princess Charlotte , and Prince Louis grow older and attend more public events, royal watchers have noted their impeccable behavior.However, when things do go awry, Kate uses a unique method to keep her children disciplined, often employing a simple but effective phrase:In his book, royal expert Tom Quinn shed light on how the princess manages moments of mischief, such as when Prince Louis made headlines during the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee.During the event, Louis was seen sticking his tongue out at his mother, but rather than reacting harshly, Kate calmly used her signature phrase. According to Quinn, while seemingly harmless, these four words carry significant weight in the royal household. The children, understanding the cue, quickly fall back in line.Former staffers have praised Kate’s calm demeanour, noting that she prefers to let her children enjoy being kids and doesn’t overly stress about minor misbehavior. A source toldthat Kate ""doesn’t worry too much"" about her children’s behaviour and ""loves seeing them being kids."" Prince Louis, in particular, is described as an energetic child who occasionally struggles to contain his excitement during public engagements. However, his cheeky antics have often been met with humor by his parents, who even acknowledged them in a light-hearted thank-you note after the Jubilee.In contrast to more traditional approaches, the Prince and Princess of Wales prioritize open dialogue and a calm atmosphere at home. When one of their children experiences strong emotions or acts out, the royal couple opts for a ""sofa chat"" rather than isolating the child. This approach allows the children to process their feelings with guidance, rather than leaving them to manage their emotions alone. Notably, the couple adheres to a strict ""no shouting"" policy, ensuring a calm and nurturing environment even when discipline is necessary.William and Kate’s modern parenting methods, which blend discipline with empathy, continue to draw praise from experts and royal fans alike, reinforcing their image as dedicated and thoughtful parents.","Kate Middleton's signature phrase is: ""let's take a break"" royal expert Tom Quinn shed light on how the princess manages moments of mischief.

Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109067339,imgsize-51000,width-400,resizemode-4/109067339.jpg"

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What are the 'fake' trading apps

How hackers targeted users

Hackers are running a sophisticated ""pig butchering"" scam operation using a bunch of fake trade apps that are available for download on both the Google Play and Apple App Store , a new report from cybersecurity firm Group-IB has claimed. These apps have helped hackers trap thousands of victims before they were detected and removed from both the platforms.If you have them on your phones, it is advised that you uninstall them right away.According to the report, these fraudulent apps -- dubbed the "" UniShadowTrade "" malware family by researchers -- were present as legitimate trading platforms, luring users into a deceptive investment scheme, commonly known as ""Pig Butchering"".These scams involve cultivating trust with victims over time, often through social media or dating apps, before introducing them to a fake investment opportunity. The scammers manipulate victims into depositing funds onto a fraudulent platform that displays fabricated high returns. When victims attempt to withdraw their ""profits,"" they discover the money is gone, and the scammers have vanished.Researchers at Group-IB discovered that the UniShadowTrade apps were built using the UniApp framework and first appeared in May. On iOS, the fraudulent app was called ""SBI-INT,"" while Android users were targeted with ""Finans Insights"" and ""Finans Trader6."" These apps were downloaded over 5,000 by Android users before their removal.To deceive users, the apps initially disguised themselves as legitimate tools. On iOS, SBI-INT posed as an app for ""algebraic mathematical formulas and 3D graphics volume area calculations.""The Android versions presented themselves as financial news aggregators. However, once installed, these apps redirected victims to fake trading platforms accessible only through invitation codes.The scammers employed social engineering tactics, often grooming victims through conversations on dating apps to gain their trust. The fraudulent apps even requested users upload personal documents like national IDs and passports, impersonating legitimacy to the scheme while simultaneously stealing sensitive information.The researchers say that while the apps have been removed from the respective app stores, hackers have shifted their distribution method to phishing websites , continuing to target unsuspecting victims.The cybersecurity firm also notes that the UniShadowTrade apps are capable of mimicking a wide range of legitimate cryptocurrency and trading platforms, advising users to exercise caution.","Hackers are running a sophisticated ""pig butchering"" scam operation using a bunch of fake trade apps that are available for download on both the Google Play and Apple App Store.
