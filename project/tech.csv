What Is “Stop Killing Games”?

Pirate’s Response Adds Fuel

“I hope your initiative gets everything that you asked for, but nothing you wanted,”

A Moment Bigger Than One Creator

Popular game developer and YouTube creator Pirate Software has lost over 100,000 subscribers in just two weeks. The steep decline comes in the wake of growing outrage over his perceived opposition to the Stop Killing Games (SKG) movement, a campaign advocating against companies shutting down online games players have paid for.The sharp drop began in late June 2025. That’s when Ross Scott, the creator of theYouTube channel and founder of the SKG initiative, released a fiery video titled. In it, he directly called out Pirate Software (real name: Jason Thor Hall) for misrepresenting the movement in an earlier 2023 video.Scott’s message landed hard. His audience is passionate gamers who’ve rallied around the SKG cause and quickly mobilised. They felt Pirate had downplayed the campaign’s core message: preserving digital game ownership and fighting corporate shutdowns of single-player games. The internet, as expected, responded swiftly.According to data from Social Blade, Pirate Software’s channel has shed over 110,000 subscribers between June 26 and July 9. The decline peaked on June 26, with a staggering 20,000 lost in a single day. And the numbers haven’t stopped dipping since.While some creators bounce back from controversies, the pace and consistency of the losses suggest a deeper fracture between Pirate and his long-time followers.SKG is a grassroots movement aimed at preserving video games in their original, playable forms, especially in light of publishers increasingly shutting down online servers or removing titles from digital storefronts. The movement recently gained huge momentum in the EU, where it crossed 1.2 million signatures on a formal citizens’ initiative, enough to demand attention from lawmakers.During a July 4 Twitch stream, Hall addressed the backlash. His tone was defiant, even as he revealed he had been swatted and received death threats.he said. This comment further inflamed tensions with the SKG community.Critics called his statement dismissive. Supporters of SKG saw it as a hostile rejection of a campaign that has garnered global support from preservationists, developers, and gamers alike.At the heart of the backlash isn’t just a difference in opinion; it’s a clash of values. The SKG movement has come to symbolise the right to access what you’ve paid for. Pirate Software’s perceived dismissal of that ideal and of the campaign's legitimacy has struck a nerve.While Hall still commands a sizable audience, the trust has taken a serious hit. Whether he can rebuild from this or chooses to double down remains to be seen.One thing’s clear: the digital preservation fight just got a lot louder.","Popular game developer and YouTube creator Pirate Software has lost over 100,000 subscribers in just two weeks.

Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino's 'Goodbye note'

After two incredible years, I’ve decided to step down as CEO of 𝕏. When @elonmusk and I first spoke of his vision for X, I knew it would be the opportunity of a lifetime to carry out the extraordinary mission of this company. I’m immensely grateful to him for entrusting me with the responsibility of protecting free speech, turning the company around, and transforming X into the Everything App.

I’m incredibly proud of the X team - the historic business turn around we have accomplished together has been nothing short of remarkable. We started with the critical early work necessary to prioritize the safety of our users—especially children, and to restore advertiser confidence. This team has worked relentlessly from groundbreaking innovations like Community Notes, and, soon, X Money to bringing the most iconic voices and content to the platform. Now, the best is yet to come as X enters a new chapter with @xai

X is truly a digital town square for all voices and the world’s most powerful culture signal. We couldn’t have achieved that without the support of our users, business partners, and the most innovative team in the world.

I’ll be cheering you all on as you continue to change the world.

As always, I’ll see you on 𝕏

Linda Yaccarino has resigned as CEO of Twitter is stepping down. Yaccarino is concluding her two-year tenure at the Elon Musk-owned social media platform, previously known as Twitter. In a long post on Twitter, Yaccarino called her role “the opportunity of a lifetime,” expressing gratitude to Elon Musk for entrusting her with the mission of safeguarding free speech, revitalizing the company, and evolving X into the “Everything App.”She joined Twitter in June 2023 after Elon Musk’s acquisition and rebranding of Twitter. Yaccarino, a former NBCUniversal advertising executive, was tasked with stabilizing the platform’s ad business amid challenges from Musk’s relaxed content moderation approach. During her leadership, Twitter prioritized rebuilding advertiser trust, enhancing user safety—particularly for children—and introducing features like Community Notes, a crowdsourced fact-checking tool, and X Money, an upcoming financial services feature.In a long post on Twitter, Yaccarino wrote:","Linda Yaccarino has resigned as CEO of Twitter.

Blue alert has been issued in Texas as authorities continue their search for a 12th suspect in what officials describe as a July 4 “ambush” at the ICE detention facility in Alvarado, Fox4 reported.Benjamin Hanil Song of Dallas faces six pending charges for allegedly opening fire on two correctional officers and an Alvarado police officer during the Prairieland detention center ambush.The suspect, a former US Marine Corps Reservist of five years, allegedly used two AR-15-style rifles to fire at three officers during the ambush.Moreover, the FBI has offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to Song's arrest.A Blue alert is a public safety notification system used to help locate and apprehend suspects who have seriously injured or killed a law enforcement officer. Much like Amber or Silver alerts, it leverages broadcast and digital platforms to quickly inform the public and encourage tips that may lead to an arrest.To issue a Blue alert, specific conditions must be met: a law enforcement officer must have been killed or critically injured; the suspect must pose a serious threat to the public or other officers; and there must be identifying information such as a vehicle description or license plate that can be shared widely.Additionally, the investigating agency must recommend activation to the Texas department of public safety.Currently, Texas is one of 34 US states that operate a Blue alert system, using it as a tool to engage the public in high-priority manhunts where officer safety and community risk are at stake.","Benjamin Hanil Song of Dallas faces six pending charges for allegedly opening fire on two correctional officers and an Alvarado police officer during the Prairieland detention center ambush.

Buck Moon: What is it and how to watch it across the Gulf,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/buck-moon-what-is-it-and-how-to-watch-it-across-the-gulf/articleshow/122355314.cms,"The Buck Moon rises low over the Gulf horizon, drawing skywatchers across the region for a rare and golden lunar spectacle/Representative Image

Gulf’s Gateway to the Skies

What Makes This Buck Moon Unique?

Micromoon marvel: Its occurrence near aphelion places it the most distant from the sun this year yet appearing larger and more golden around the horizon.

Major Lunar Standstill effect: Occurring every 18.6 years, this astronomical phenomenon exaggerates how low the moon appears further deepening its horizon-hugging appearance.

Best Viewing Spots in the Gulf

UAE: Jumeirah Beach & Al Qudra Lakes

Qatar: Katara Cultural Village Amphitheatre

Oman: Wahiba Sands Desert Camps

Saudi Arabia: AlUla UNESCO Observatory Nights

Best Time and Way to Watch

Why the Buck Moon Matters to Gulf Stargazers

A merging of science & tradition: This cosmic event resonates uniquely with Gulf communities. Observation nights often feature poetry readings, cultural storytelling, and family sessions under the moonlit desert sky.

Astronomy as tourism magnet: Locations like AlUla, Qurum, and Fujairah are increasingly branding themselves as astro-tourism hubs drawing visitors and boosting local night-sky awareness.

Educational push: Planetariums in Doha, Riyadh, and Abu Dhabi are using the event to launch STEM workshops and amateur astronomer training, nurturing a new generation of Gulf sky enthusiasts.

How to Prepare for the Night

Check the weather: Clear skies are essential. Coastal spots usually have milder haze than inland deserts.

Choose a low-horizon vantage point: Rooftops, beaches, or desert locales with open eastern views are best.

Bring tech-savvy tools: A smartphone app + monocular/binoculars = enhanced viewing.

Join an event: Public astronomy events often include local astrophysicists who’ll guide you to spot nearby Mars or Saturn, which often accompany the full moon.

Capture it well: Use a DSLR or smartphone with tripod; timing the moonrise yields dramatic horizon shots with desert or city silhouettes.





TL;DR: July 10 marks the 2025 Buck Moon: a “micromoon” occurring near Earth’s aphelion, making it one of the farthest and lowest full moons of the year.In the Gulf region especially the UAE, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the best time to observe it is right after sunset, facing southeast. Skywatching gatherings at popular outdoor venues and planetariums across Gulf nations will amplify the experience, blending astronomy with local culture.This July 10, the Gulf's night sky will stage a spectacular event: the Buck Moon; July's full moon, named after the time male deer grow new antlers coincides this year with Earth’s aphelion, making it the furthest full moon from the sun in 2025.

The southeastern horizon will offer the clearest view, especially from places with minimal light pollution.For an enhanced experience, astronomers recommend heading to elevated locations or wide-open beaches. Using apps like Star Walk or Sky Guide can help pinpoint the moon’s position in real time, and a pair of binoculars can add depth to the view.

Visa runs are a legitimate and convenient way to extend your UAE stay. By exiting to Oman or nearby countries and re-entering, you get a fresh visa stamp, allowing for a continued stay. Multiple service providers operate daily, offering both border and airport-based options. Ensure you're eligible, have all required documents, and plan ahead to avoid penalties.In the UAE, overstaying your visa comes with clear consequences , and a daily price tag. Once your visa expires, and you're beyond any grace period, you're subject to a fine of AED 50 (~USD 13.60) per day. In addition, you’ll need to pay an exit permit fee of AED 250–350 (~USD 68–95) when you leave. These penalties apply across the board, whether you’re on a visit visa, a tourist visa, or a residency visa.To avoid those penalties and remain in the country legally, many visitors turn to a well-established and structured option: the visa run.A visa run is the process of strategically leaving the UAE temporarily and re-entering, typically on the same day, in order to reset your visa status and legally extend your stay.It’s most commonly used by those who entered on a 30- or 90-day tourist or visit visa and need more time without switching to a long-term visa.This method doesn't violate any immigration rules. In fact, it operates entirely within the framework of UAE border control and is widely recognized as a legitimate solution for visitors and temporary residents needing more time in the country.Most visa runs are made to neighboring Oman, given its proximity and straightforward land border access from Dubai and other Emirates. Others may involve flying to nearby countries, depending on visa status, timing, or agency arrangements.The process is especially useful for:For nationalities that receive a visa on arrival, this can be a remarkably smooth process, often involving just a short trip to the border, then re-entering the UAE on a renewed entry stamp.Visa runs are a smart solution, but not a free-for-all. They're especially practical for travelers from countries that are eligible for 30-day visa on arrival in the UAE. These travelers can often exit and re-enter without any pre-approval, making the process both fast and relatively low-cost.Here’s a list of nationalities that currently benefit from the 30-day renewable visa on arrival and are eligible for UAE-Oman visa run services:Additional eligible countries include Uzbekistan and Mongolia. If your country is on this list, you are eligible to enter the UAE multiple times with a new visa issued upon each arrival, provided your documents are in order.It’s worth noting that border visa runs are typically limited to three consecutive renewals. After reaching this limit, you may want to explore alternatives like the airport-to-airport (A2A) visa switch or returning to your home country to renew or apply for a new visa. Some agencies also offer visa change flights to nearby destinations like Bahrain or Kuwait. Always remember, immigration officials have discretion and may deny entry if they suspect the system is being misused or if your stay doesn’t appear genuine.The UAE–Oman border is by far the most popular and practical route for visa runs, especially for travelers holding 30-day visa-on-arrival eligibility. Located about 140 km from Downtown Dubai, roughly a 1 hour 40 minute drive, this border crossing offers a convenient way to extend your stay legally without overstaying your visa. Multiple agencies run daily roundtrip services from Dubai to Oman, making it a dependable and widely used option for visa renewals.Since August 2024, nationals from the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Japan, and New Zealand receive a 90-day visa on arrival, valid over a 180-day period. After using these 90 days, re-entry on arrival is not possible until the next cycle; a pre-approved visa would be required to enter the UAE.That’s where visa runs or visa changes come in. Visa run services offer early morning (around 7 AM) bus trips to Oman (via Hatta or Al Ain–Buraimi), handling all visa paperwork. The package typically includes an express 60-day visa, return transport to Oman, and hotel accommodation during visa processing. You can relax while your visa is approved and return to the UAE by late afternoon (around 5 PM) with your fresh visa, all within the same day.If you're applying for your Omani entry visa yourself instead of going through an agency, you can do this easily through the Royal Oman Police (ROP) website. Select the unsponsored 26A visa, a 10-day tourist visa, upload a scanned passport and photo, and pay the 5 Omani Rial (~AED 48) fee. Processing time ranges from a couple of hours to up to three days. Once approved, print your e-visa and carry a hard copy with you on the trip.In addition to the service fee, budget for:This method is one of the most cost-effective and time-saving visa renewal strategies, provided you're from an eligible nationality and have all documentation in place. It's widely used by tourists, freelancers, job seekers, and anyone in transition to residency.Another option, particularly when land runs are not ideal or permitted due to visa rules, is the airport-to-airport visa run. This involves flying out of the UAE, to Oman, Bahrain, or Kuwait, for example, and returning with a new visa arranged in advance.While this option may require an overnight stay, depending on visa processing times, it’s often used by travelers whose nationality doesn’t qualify for a visa on arrival.This method is especially common when border runs are no longer allowed due to visa count or policy updates.Whether you’re going by road or air, here are the essentials:Though not mandatory, travel and health insurance covering both the UAE and Oman is highly recommended for any visa run.Several agencies in the UAE have made visa runs hassle-free by offering full-service packages that include transportation, coordination, and support:Both providers emphasize planning your visa run at least five days before your current visa expires, allowing ample time to avoid penalties or issues.Visa runs offer a clear, legal, and practical way to extend your stay in the UAE without breaking the rules. When done through proper channels, with the right documentation, timing, and understanding of your eligibility, they serve as a valuable bridge between short-term visits and more permanent arrangements.They're not a workaround or a grey area. They are a recognized tool in the UAE’s flexible visa framework, especially for tourists, job seekers, freelancers, and families who need more time, and who want to do it the right way.Just remember:And with that, you’ll find that staying longer in the UAE can be as straightforward as a bus ride to the border, and back again.Yes, visa runs are legal and operate within UAE’s border control system, as long as you follow the rules and have the correct documentation.The cost starts at AED 440 (~USD 120) for a border visa run and AED 1250 (~USD 340) for a 60-day visa extension with hotel accommodation.You’ll need a valid passport, passport copy, current UAE entry stamp, photo, and potentially car documents or a guarantor, depending on your situation.Border visa runs typically take one day, leave early morning and return by late afternoon. Airport-based runs may take 1–2 days.Border visa runs are generally limited to three consecutive times. After that, you’ll need to explore alternatives like an airport-to-airport visa switch.If you're using the border visa run option, no pre-approval is needed for most nationalities. For other visa options, you may need to pre-arrange the visa.You’ll be fined AED 50 (~USD 13.60) per day plus an exit fee of AED 250–350 (~USD 68–95) when leaving the UAE.","Visa runs are a widely practiced and accepted method used by tourists, job seekers, and remote workers to legally extend their stay in the UAE.

Verify the offer letter with MOHRE before making travel or visa arrangements.





You are not legally considered an employee until a contract is signed and a work permit is issued.





If your offer is revoked unfairly, you may file a civil case for compensation.









If you’ve received a job offer from a UAE-based company, it's natural to feel excited. But before booking your flight and packing your bags, take a moment to confirm whether the offer is legally valid and enforceable. In the UAE, a signed offer letter between an employer and a prospective employee may be considered an, but not necessarily aIn general legal terms, an agreement (like an offer letter) can be informal, while a contract is a formal agreement enforceable by law. In other words, all contracts are agreements, but not all agreements are contracts.When recruiting in the UAE, employers must issue an official offer letter detailing employment terms and conditions. These terms must then appear identically in the employment contract. The employer and employee may also add more favourable terms for the employee if both agree.This is supported by Article 2(1) of Ministerial Decree No. 46 of 2022 regarding work permits, job offers, and employment contract forms, which states:“Utilise the approved standard employment contract that conforms with the job offer when requesting the issuance of the work permit.It is permissible to add more benefits to the employee in the contract than those mentioned in the job offer; it is also permissible to add annexure to the contract provided that it does not conflict with the provisions of the decree-law and its executive regulations.""An offer letter must follow the format prescribed by the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MOHRE). As per Article 1 of Administrative Resolution No. 38 of 2022, it is mandatory to use the e-forms available on the MOHRE system:""By the guidelines attached herein, electronic forms (e-forms) provided in Mohre system for work permits, offer letters, and employment contracts shall be adopted and implemented.""When applying for a work permit, employers must submit a signed offer letter and other required documents to MOHRE. After approval and payment of the required fees, an official employment contract is created.Before making any commitments, you should contact MOHRE to verify whether the offer letter you’ve received is legitimate and recorded in their system. If your offer letter is not in MOHRE’s approved format, you have the right to request one that is.In some cases, you may also approach the UAE Embassy in your country (such as the UK) for assistance in verifying the authenticity of your job offer, if such services are provided.It’s important to understand that if your prospective employer rescinds the offer letter and you haven’t signed an employment contract or been issued a work permit, MOHRE may not accept your complaint.This is because an employer and employee are only considered parties to an official employment relationship once a valid contract is signed and registered with MOHRE.If the offer is revoked and you suffer monetary loss or damage as a result, you may consider filing a civil case against the prospective employer in a UAE court that has jurisdiction over such matters.This can be pursued under civil liability claims, particularly if you can prove that the employer’s actions led to demonstrable harm such as travel arrangements made in anticipation of employment.Staying vigilant during your job search and relocation process can save you significant hardship later. Always verify first—then move with confidence.","In the UAE, a signed offer letter between an employer and a prospective employee may be considered an, but not necessarily a contract.

From trees to table: Why Bahraini almonds are the talk of the season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/from-trees-to-table-why-bahraini-almonds-are-the-talk-of-the-season/articleshow/122289247.cms,"Local vendors showcase vibrant batches of Bahraini almonds as the summer season officially kicks off, with popular varieties like Habban and Jumbo drawing eager buyers/Image: News of Bahrain





With the arrival of summer and rising temperatures, the much-loved Bahraini almonds are once again appearing on fruit stalls and kitchen tables. Known for their high quality and variety, the local almonds especially the popular ""Habban"" and ""Jumbo"" types are now in season, bringing fresh activity to the markets.These almonds began arriving in the markets just a few days ago, with prices ranging between BD2.5 and BD4 per kilogram depending on size and quality. Premium varieties are even fetching prices as high as BD8.In the coming weeks, two more types: Iskandarani and Jumbo are expected to arrive. Both are known for their large size, excellent taste, and firm texture. Shoppers are eagerly awaiting their return to the shelves.To a local news outlet, vendor Ahmed Abu Karim explained that Habban almonds usually kick off the local almond season and are available for about a month. They come in different colours and sizes, such as yellow-within-red and solid red. Prices depend on the size and overall quality, the larger, high-grade almonds can go up to BD7 per kilo, although most are sold between BD2 and BD4.Abu Karim also noted that the quality and quantity of the crop are heavily influenced by humidity.Higher humidity means better ripening, plumper almonds, and a sweeter taste.He added that after the Habban variety, other types begin to appear, especially the Iskandarani almonds which are known for their rich red interior and delicious flavour and the sought-after Jumbo almonds, priced for their size.Another seller, Qassim Abdullah, pointed out that Habban almonds are well-known in Bahrain and are named for their small, rounded shape resembling a “little seed.”He also mentioned that imported almonds, particularly from Qatif, are becoming more common in local markets and are sold for around BD2 per kilo. However, he believes they can’t compare to Bahraini almonds in terms of sweetness and taste.

The Gulf is rich with folk tales, some filled with bravery and hardship, others drenched in fear. Saudi YouTuber and indie developer Abdulla Al Hamad turned to the terrifying end of that spectrum for inspiration for his first-person horror game,The game draws from the Emirati jinn legend of, a supernatural entity that lures and kills weak-willed men. In, players enter an empty home haunted by a similar malevolent being. Once inside, they must solve puzzles while evading the creature that lurks in the shadows.Al Hamad says he was intrigued by people’s obsession with fear.“I realised people genuinely enjoy being scared—it’s fun for them,” he told local news outlet“I wanted to create something simple but effective. Horror games don’t require massive development, they require just five or six core mechanics. The rest is all about creativity in the story.”Launched in October 2024,quickly gained traction as regional content creators showcased their playthroughs. It has since reached audiences in East Asia and Turkey, cultures that Al Hamad says share similar folklore roots.Played in first-person, the game immerses players into the shoes of the protagonist exploring what initially seems to be a deserted house. But it becomes clear something sinister is watching. Players must solve puzzles and navigate the space while avoiding the wrath of the ghostly Aunt Fatima.While comparisons have been made toand Hideo Kojima’s, Al Hamad says those weren’t direct influences.“I scare easily, I don’t even watch horror films,” he laughs. “But somehow, I ended up making a horror game.”Instead, his true inspiration came from his own surroundings.He based the haunted house in the game on his grandfather’s home and also visited abandoned areas in Al Khobar, which locals claim are haunted.“For example, the clock that chimes every quarter hour? That’s from my grandfather’s house. The telephone, rugs, bed, and lamps all of them are real details I grew up with,” he said.That authenticity givesa distinct regional identity. One scene even features a(incense burner) on a table, filling the house with aromatic smoke which is an iconic feature in Gulf households.Despite being a solo project,includes over an hour of gameplay and is powered by Nvidia’s DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) system. The AI-powered rendering enhances visuals without sacrificing performance, giving the game a polished feel that rivals major studio titles.“To make a horror game work, you need quick reaction time, and DLSS really made that possible,” Al Hamad said.“Seeinglisted on Nvidia’s site next toandmade me incredibly proud.”With Gulf folklore and nostalgic authenticity woven into every shadowed corner,is setting a new standard for regional horror games and is gaining international recognition while doing it.","Saudi YouTuber and indie developer Abdulla Al Hamad turned to the terrifying end of that spectrum for inspiration for his first-person horror game.

A striking video of a huge shelf cloud moving over the Washington DC area has gone viral on social media. It appeared as strong storms hit the region, with weather officials warning about flash floods and severe thunderstorms in and around the capital.The video, shared on X, was reportedly taken in Bowie, Maryland. It shows a dark, low cloud spreading across the suburbs. As the cloud passed, the daylight suddenly dimmed, making the area look like it was in an eerie twilight.An X user posted, ""Shelf cloud seen moving through the DC area while flash flood, thunderstorm, and tornado warnings were active. The cloud (video below) was filmed in Bowie, Maryland.""According to a report by the Washington Post, tornado, thunderstorm, and flash flood warnings were in effect across parts of the region when the shelf cloud was spotted. While the most intense storms had moved east of the capital by late evening, heavy rain lingered, particularly in and around DC, prompting a flood watch and a severe thunderstorm alert to remain in place for several counties.Meteorologists say shelf clouds are often seen at the leading edge of powerful storm systems. Typically accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain, and lightning, they serve as visual indicators of potentially dangerous weather.Although shelf clouds themselves are not tornadoes, they often precede conditions conducive to severe thunderstorms or tornadic activity.According to WTOP, the severe thunderstorm watch remained in effect until 9pm, while flood advisories continued late into the night. Local stations also reported temporary ground halts at airports like Reagan National and Dulles, as safety measures were enacted.Local authorities urged residents to remain indoors during the peak of the storm and to exercise caution as downpours may continue into the night, threatening low-lying areas with potential flooding.More severe weather could still be on the cards, as officials monitor the weather conditions. Residents have been advised to stay tuned to local forecasts and emergency alerts.","A video of a huge shelf cloud moving over the Washington DC area has gone viral on social media.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

The ongoing digital campaigns further illustrate the government’s commitment to enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of pension services, ensuring that pensioners receive their benefits without unnecessary delays.The submission window for life certificates opened on November 1 for pensioners under the age of 80. This is part of an annual cycle during which pensioners must reaffirm their eligibility for pension disbursement. The deadline for submitting the life certificate is November 30. If the certificate is not submitted by this deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting in December. This requirement also applies to super senior citizens (aged 80 and above), who were allowed to submit their certificates starting on October 1, with the same November 30 deadline.Pensioners can submit their life certificates through several methods, accommodating various preferences and technological capabilities. Here are the options available:For those choosing to submit their life certificates online through the Jeevan Pramaan Portal, the following steps are involved:For pensioners opting for offline submission, the process is straightforward:If pensioners fail to submit their life certificates by the stipulated deadline, their pension payments will be halted starting the following month. However, payments will resume once the life certificate is submitted, thereby ensuring that pensioners do not permanently lose access to their funds, provided they complete the required process.In an effort to facilitate the submission process, the Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare (DoPPW) has initiated its third nationwide digital life certificate (DLC) campaign. This campaign runs from November 1 to November 30, covering 800 cities and districts. The campaign aims to promote the use of digital platforms for certificate submission, ensuring greater accessibility for pensioners.On the first day of this campaign, over 1.8 lakh pensioners successfully generated their digital life certificates, highlighting the growing adoption of technology among pensioners. This indicates a positive trend towards digitalization and the effective use of biometric authentication methods.A life certificate is an official document that verifies a pensioner's living status, required annually to continue receiving pension benefits.All pensioners, including family pensioners, must submit a life certificate to maintain their pension payments.Pensioners under 80 must submit their life certificate between November 1 and November 30 each year. Super senior citizens (80 and above) can submit theirs starting from October 1, with the same deadline.If the life certificate is not submitted by the deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting the following month.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online via the Jeevan Pramaan portal, through doorstep banking agents, using biometric devices at post offices, or in person at bank branches.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online by using the Jeevan Pramaan portal and completing biometric verification through designated apps.Yes, pensioners can submit their life certificates in person at their respective banks or post offices.Generally, you will need your Aadhaar number for biometric verification, along with any other identification or pension-related documents as required by your pension disbursing authority.Pensioners can check the status of their life certificate submission through the Jeevan Pramaan portal or by contacting their bank or pension disbursing authority.Yes, if your submission fails, you can reapply and submit your life certificate again using the same methods available to you.",Submission window for 'Jeevan Pramaan Patra' opens for pensioners under 80 with a deadline of November 30. Pensioners can opt to have a bank agent visit them at home to facilitate the submission of their life certificate. This method is particularly beneficial for those with mobility issues.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114942014,imgsize-53514,width-400,resizemode-4/114942014.jpg"

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has confirmed that a Model Y car successfully drove itself from the company’s factory near Austin to a customer’s home, marking what he described as the ""first time"" for such an autonomous delivery. This move showcases Tesla's ongoing push into autonomous driving technology. In a post shared on the social media platform X (earlier Twitter), the tech billionaire said that the autonomous delivery of the Model Y occurred ""across town"" and included travel on highways. He also mentioned that the delivery was completed “a day ahead of schedule."" In a comment on the post, the tech billionaire also specified that there was no one inside the car during the delivery, nor were there any remote operators controlling the vehicle. Later on, he shared multiple posts, including one with a video showing the car driving itself to the customer's home.In his first post regarding this Tesla achievement, Elon Musk wrote:he noted, adding more details about Tesla’s first fully autonomous delivery in the post’s comment section.Later on, replying to the customer’s post who received his self-driving Tesla Model Y at his home, Musk wrote:Soon after, Tesla shared a video of the car driving itself to the customer from the company’s factory.

The infamous Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), a sight that has long signaled critical system errors for Windows users, is reportedly getting a dramatic makeover. According to a report in The Verge, starting today, Microsoft is rolling out a newly designed Black Screen of Death to Windows 11 Release Preview users, marking the first significant visual change to the error screen since the introduction of a sad face in Windows 8.The shift, which is expected to reach all Windows 11 users in the coming weeks, sees the removal of the familiar frowning emoticon and QR code in favor of a more simplified, monochromatic display. The new Black screen closely resembles the interface users typically encounter during a Windows update .This aesthetic update isn't merely cosmetic. The simplified BSOD will prominently display the stop code and the faulty system driver, aiming to provide clearer and more actionable information for both individual Windows users and IT administrators. ""This is really an attempt on clarity and providing better information and allowing us and customers to really get to what the core of the issue is so we can fix it faster,"" stated David Weston, vice president of enterprise and OS security at Microsoft, in a June interview with The Verge.While Microsoft briefly experimented with a black BSOD in test builds of Windows 11 back in 2021, this current rollout signifies a permanent transition. The change is part of a broader Windows 11 update that also introduces Microsoft's Quick Machine Recovery (QMR) feature. QMR is designed to rapidly restore machines that fail to boot correctly, further demonstrating Microsoft's commitment to enhancing Windows' resilience, especially in the wake of last year's CrowdStrike incident.",The infamous Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) is reportedly getting a dramatic makeover.

Amazon has found its 'own way’ to cool down Nvidia’s AI graphics cards,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-has-found-its-own-way-to-cool-down-nvidias-ai-graphics-cards/articleshow/122372598.cms,"What the AWS VP said about these tools developed for Nvidia GPUs



Introducing Amazon EC2 P6e-GB200 UltraServers: Powering Frontier AI at Scale | Amazon Web Services

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Amazon's cloud division has reportedly developed its own hardware to cool next-generation Nvidia graphics cards for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. This internal solution addresses the significant energy consumption and heat generation associated with Nvidia's GPUs, which are vital for AI workloads. Dave Brown, Vice President of Compute and Machine Learning Services at Amazon Web Services (AWS), stated in a YouTube video that commercially available cooling equipment was not suitable and building data centres with widespread liquid cooling would have taken too much time. This led Amazon to develop its methods that can better manage the heat from these power-intensive Nvidia GPUs.Talking about the cooling equipment available for AI GPUs in the video, Brown said: “They would take up too much data centre floor space or increase water usage substantially. And while some of these solutions could work for lower volumes at other providers, they simply wouldn’t be enough liquid-cooling capacity to support our scale.”So, instead of relying on conventional solutions, Amazon engineers developed the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX), a cooling system that can be integrated into both existing and future data centres. Previously, these traditional air cooling methods have been sufficient for earlier Nvidia chip generations.In a blog post, Brown also confirmed that AWS customers can now access this updated infrastructure through new P6e computing instances. These new offerings support Nvidia’s high-density computing architecture, particularly the GB200 NVL72, which consolidates 72 Nvidia Blackwell GPUs into a single rack for training and deploying large AI models.Previously, similar Nvidia GB200 NVL72-based clusters were available via Microsoft and CoreWeave. AWS, as the leading global cloud infrastructure provider, continues to enhance its capabilities.Amazon has a history of developing its infrastructure hardware, including custom chips for general computing and AI, along with in-house-designed storage servers and networking equipment.This approach reduces reliance on external vendors and can improve profitability. AWS posted its highest operating margin since at least 2014 during the first quarter, contributing significantly to Amazon’s overall net income.Microsoft, the second-largest cloud provider, has also moved into custom hardware. In 2023, it introduced a cooling system called Sidekicks, tailored for its Maia AI chips.","Amazon's cloud division has reportedly developed its own hardware to cool next- generation Nvidia graphics cards for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.

Major redesign planned for 2027 as competition heats up

Apple is planning to introduce its first upgrade to the $3,499 Vision Pro headset as early as this year, aiming to improve performance and comfort of a device that has struggled to gain consumer traction since its February 2024 launch.The updated Vision Pro will feature a faster M4 processor—currently used in iPad Pro and MacBook Pro models—replacing the outdated M2 chip, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke to Bloomberg. The upgrade will also include enhanced artificial intelligence components with additional neural engine cores beyond the current 16-core configuration, and a redesigned strap system to reduce neck strain and head pain from the 1.4-pound device.While this initial upgrade focuses on performance improvements, Apple is simultaneously developing a significantly lighter redesigned model targeted for 2027. The company is also working on a tethered enterprise headset and planning true AR glasses, with the ultimate goal of dominating the smart glasses category.The Vision Pro's disappointing market performance stems from its cumbersome hardware, hefty price tag, and lack of compelling exclusive applications. Apple has sold only hundreds of thousands of units since launch—far below expectations for a company that successfully revolutionized smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches.The minor second-generation changes are unlikely to transform the headset into a consumer hit but may attract corporate customers and encourage more app developers to support the platform. Apple will also roll out visionOS 26 operating system later this year, featuring virtual widgets and eye-scrolling capabilities.Competition is intensifying as Meta Platforms offers cheaper alternatives and Samsung prepares to launch its Moohan headset in 2025. Meta plans to release true AR glasses by 2027, potentially beating Apple to market by several years.Earlier this year, Apple reshuffled the Vision Pro team, with top manager Mike Rockwell transitioning to focus on Siri and the headset's operating system, while software and hardware teams were reorganized into different development groups.","Apple is planning to introduce its first upgrade to the $3,499 Vision Pro headset as early as this year.

Why the 2025 YouTube monetisation policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety and accountability.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue. Simple re-uploads or minimal edits will not qualify.","On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content. This includes AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near- duplicate slideshow news.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122370986,imgsize-20718,width-400,resizemode-4/YouTube-monetisation-policy-update.jpg"
"Japan sets new internet speed record, is 16 million times faster than India's average",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/japans-sets-new-internet-speed-record-is-16-million-times-faster-than-indias-average/articleshow/122368875.cms,"19-core cable creates a data superhighway

Lab success paves way for AI-driven internet future

Japanese researchers have achieved a groundbreaking internet speed of 1.02 petabits per second , creating a new world record that is 3.5 million times faster than the average US internet connection and an astounding 16 million times faster than India's average speed of 63.55 Mbps.The record-setting achievement was accomplished by Japan 's National Institute of Information and Communications Technology ( NICT ) working with Sumitomo Electric and European partners. Their innovative 19-core optical fiber cable transmitted data at unprecedented speeds over 1,808 kilometers, roughly equivalent to the distance from London to Rome.To put this speed in perspective, the new technology could theoretically download the entire Netflix library in under one second or massive 150GB video games like Warzone in the blink of an eye. The average U.S. broadband speed of 290 Mbps pales in comparison to the 1,020,000,000 Mbps achieved in this test.The breakthrough lies in the cable's design: instead of using a single light path, the fiber squeezes 19 separate cores into the same standard diameter as existing cables. This creates what researchers describe as a ""19-lane superhighway"" for data transmission while maintaining compatibility with current infrastructure.The team overcame traditional signal degradation challenges by developing sophisticated amplification systems that boost signals across multiple wavelength bands simultaneously. Using 180 wavelengths with advanced signal processing, they maintained signal strength over the extended distance.While this technology remains in laboratory testing, it represents a crucial step toward meeting future data demands. As global internet traffic continues to surge, driven by AI applications, autonomous vehicles, and billions of connected devices, such advances offer hope for expanding network capacity without requiring entirely new infrastructure installations.","Japanese researchers have achieved a groundbreaking internet speed of 1.02 petabits per second.

World No. 1 Chess grandmaster Magnus Carlsen shared couple of screenshots of him beating OpenAI 's ChatGPT with sheer dominance. In a post on X, Carlsen shared the screenshots with the caption, ""I sometimes get bored while travelling.""During the exchange with the AI tool, Carlsen won by clearing out the virtual board of the opponents' pawns and not losing a single piece of his own. The tool analysed further, ""That was methodical, clean and sharp. Well played!""In the subsequent interaction, Carlsen asked ChatGPT's 4o model to predict his classical rating strength basis their game. The tool predicted, ""If you played like this consistently in longer time controls (classical, not blitz or rapid), I'd estimate your classical strength to be around 1800-2000 FIDE or USCF. Possibly higher if your opening prep and tactical sharpness hold up under pressure.""Unfortunately, the openAI model was well of base. Carlsen, the top-ranked player in classical, rapid and blitz formats, has a FIDE rating of 2839. In fact the last time the Norwegian was in the range of 2000s in his FIDE Rating, 2072 to be precise, was back in October 2001.Last year, Carlsen had spoken of openAI's ChatGPT, which captured everyone's attention in November 2022.“AI was extremely exciting at first because it presented a little bit of a different way to play chess, in more of a hybrid human engine way. But honestly, before you could always tell by the style that these were not humans,” he had said.“Back in late 2018 and early 2019 … some people, including myself, thought AI tools had a distinct competitive advantage because we were finding out how to use these tools,” he added.“Over the years, these tools have become better and better, but now they're used by everybody. So it's harder to gain a competitive advantage from it”.","World No. 1 Chess grandmaster Magnus Carlsen shared couple of screenshots of him beating OpenAI's ChatGPT with sheer dominance.

How the technology works

Can the visually impaired also enjoy the fun and thrill of a Formula E race? Yes, it’s now possible — thanks to a new initiative by Formula E and Google Cloud: an AI-powered audio race report. This initiative promotes inclusivity and makes motorsport more accessible for blind and visually impaired fans. Google Cloud will work with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) to conduct focus groups and user testing during upcoming race weekends in Berlin and London, with a full rollout planned for Formula E season 12.The project was unveiled by Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds at the Google Cloud Summit in London. It uses Google Cloud’s generative AI technology to create rich, descriptive audio summaries of every E-Prix race. These reports will offer fans a dynamic recap that captures the excitement and key moments of each race, available on demand shortly after the chequered flag.The initiative originated from a Google Cloud Hackathon held during the 2024 London E-Prix. It is being developed in close partnership with RNIB to ensure the final product meets the needs of visually impaired users.Sharing his enthusiasm about the collaboration, Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds said, “At Formula E, we believe the thrill of electric racing should be accessible to everyone. This innovative collaboration with Google Cloud is a fantastic example of how technology can be used for good—creating a brand-new way for blind and visually impaired fans to experience the drama and emotion of our sport. By working closely with the RNIB, we are ensuring this innovation is truly inclusive and fit for purpose, so that no fan is left behind. ”John Abel, Managing Director of Specialised Software at Google Cloud, added, “For too long, the visual nature of racing has been a barrier for fans who are blind or visually impaired. Google Cloud's AI technology will act as a digital storyteller, creating a vivid audio narrative that brings the speed, strategy, and excitement of Formula E to life. We are proud to work alongside a partner like Formula E that shares our passion for using innovation to break down barriers and connect people through shared experiences. ”Sonali Rai, RNIB’s Media, Culture and Immersive Technology Lead, also said, “Audio description transforms how blind and partially sighted motorsport fans can fully engage in enjoying the full racing spectacle—taking in the visceral sounds of cars on the track while feeling the passion of the crowd.”She continued, “RNIB has been working with Formula E and Google Cloud on this AI-powered podcast, which promises to give a full picture of the race in an accessible and engaging way for blind and partially sighted fans. Formula E’s commitment to working directly with the community to develop this technology is exactly the right approach. It sets a fantastic standard in inclusivity for other sports to follow and stay on track with new advances in innovation. ”The audio report is generated through a multi-stage process powered by Google Cloud's AI platform, Vertex AI. Google’s Chirp model accurately transcribes live race commentary. Google’s Gemini models analyze the transcribed commentary along with live timing data and other official race information. The AI identifies key events such as overtakes, incidents, and strategic pit stops and generates an engaging, fact-based race summary.Also Read: Berlin E-Prix: From Oliver Rowland’s World Championship win to Felipe Drugovich’s debut, there’s a lot to look forward to The text is then converted into natural, expressive speech using advanced text-to-speech technology, resulting in a polished audio report ready for distribution. The entire process is completed within minutes of the race’s conclusion. The reports will be available globally on Spotify and other popular audio platforms in more than 15 languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Mandarin, and Arabic.",Formula E and Google Cloud team up to create AI-powered audio race report.
