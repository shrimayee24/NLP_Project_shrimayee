Bluebird Lift-Off Shows ISRO Commercial Power As Nambi Narayanan Calls LVM-3 Game Changer Move

The Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ) on Wednesday released rare onboard camera footage from its heaviest rocket, LVM3-M6, offering a rocket-eye view of the BlueBird Block-2 mission from liftoff to satellite separation.The footage shared by Isro on X features visuals captured by cameras onboard and documents each major phase of the ascent. The footage shows the rocket lifting off from the second launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, followed by the separation of the twin S200 solid strap-on boosters. It then captures the separation of the L110 liquid core stage and the jettisoning of the payload fairing, before concluding with the successful separation of the BlueBird Block-2 satellite into Low Earth Orbit.The stunning visuals were recorded during Isro’s successful commercial launch of the next-generation US communication satellite for AST SpaceMobile earlier in the day. The 6,100 kg satellite was placed into its intended orbit at an altitude of about 520 km, approximately 15 minutes after launch.The 43.5-metre-tall LVM3 lifted off at 8.55 am after the completion of a 24-hour countdown. Powered by two S200 solid boosters, a liquid core stage and a cryogenic upper stage, the rocket performed all mission events as planned.The space agency said the mission, designated LVM3-M6, marked the sixth operational flight of the LVM3 launch vehicle, nicknamed ‘Bahubali’ for its heavy-lift capability. Isro chief, Dr V Narayanan, described mission’s success as a ""season’s gift"" to the country.BlueBird Block-2 is part of a Low Earth Orbit constellation being developed by US-based AST SpaceMobile. The satellite is designed to enable direct-to-mobile connectivity, providing 4G and 5G voice and video calls, text messaging, streaming and data services directly to standard mobile smartphones.Developed by Isro, the three-stage LVM3 has a lift-off mass of 640 tonnes and a payload capability of 4,200 kg to Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit. In earlier missions, it has successfully launched Chandrayaan-2, Chandrayaan-3 and two OneWeb missions carrying 72 satellites.","Isro released rare onboard camera footage from its heaviest rocket, LVM3-M6, offering a rocket-eye view of the BlueBird Block-2 mission.

It looks like her most personal album to date, and fans couldn't be more excited for it to drop next month.Beyond fashion and music, Beer has also been using her platform to speak openly with fans. During a recent Instagram Q&A, she addressed a question about handling “hate or bullying.” Her response struck a chord with many, where she said, “I remind myself that I know who I am, I know the people who know me do as well, and I need to be okay with that.She stated that it is natural to feel sad and not capable from time to time. Being fearful and somber about being misunderstood should not make someone guilty, according to her. She explained it, saying, “Being misunderstood and bullied can really hurt. It's human to react and care, and I don't make myself feel guilty for still getting sad sometimes about it, all these years later,” she wrote.She encouraged fans to always imbibe kindness and empathy and does not understand what certain people gain by putting people down. Beer added, “Everyone is dealing with something, and I don't personally see any gain in just attacking or ripping down another human being just because I could.” The popstar’s wise and compassionate attitude is why fans love her and is a huge part of her music as well.Also read: ‘It is really painful’: Justin Herbert’s beau Madison Beer gets blunt about mental health and bullying","The singer-songwriter revealed her new caramel brown hair color on her Insta story.

The state of AI adoption





American billionaire and entrepreneur Mark Cuban has now urged the young engineers entering the job market to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (MNCs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI). Cuban feels that smaller companies offer better platform for new graduates to make an immediate impact, while large corporations often dilute individual contributions.Speaking in an interview with CNBC and on his podcast The Dumbest Guy in the Room, Cuban explained that smaller companies are mainly entrepreneur-driven and they lack the deep IT departments or larger corporations. This gap creates opportunities for fresh graduates which directly contribute to the AI projects.“Small- to medium-size companies don’t have that depth. They are typically entrepreneurially driven and don’t have the flexibility to have people research things. Bringing a new graduate on to work on agentic AI projects is inexpensive for them and can get them immediate results,” Cuban said.Cuban also used the example of his own company, Cost Plus Drugs, noting how AI can automate processes to boost productivity, competitiveness, and profitability.Cuban argued that in big organisations, AI skills may not stand out as they are common among thousands of IT employees. On the other hand, in smaller firms often lack such expertise, making new graduates with AI knowledge invaluable. He also compared the present wave of AI with early days of the internet, when young engineers were hired to implement new technologies because they were more comfortable with them than older executives.Cuban also highlighted that 95% of companies have not yet seen measurable revenue returns from AI investments. The exceptions, he said, are mostly early-stage startups led by young entrepreneurs who design their processes around AI models tailored to their businesses.He urged his children and other young people to learn as much as possible about AI, stressing that companies are still grappling with how to use the technology for competitive advantage.",Mark Cuban has urged young engineers to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (MNCs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu was recently asked by an X (formerly Twitter) user why there is no talk about Arattai now? The user quoted a post stating that Telegram is worth $30 billion with only 30 employees working from home, no office. Responding to the user’s question, Vembu shared that the company is doing “updates weekly” and is working on “some very important features”. “We will market it more once we feel we are satisfied with the feature set!,” Vembu posted, adding “This is a marathon.

Apple's Secret 3-Year Plan: A New iPhone Era is Coming!

iPhone 18 features (expected)





We are months away from the launch of iPhone 18, but the rumour mill is already churning news around it. The affordable variant of the 2026 iPhone series is said to have a different launch timeline than its predecessor. Apple usually unveils its iPhone range in September every year. But, this may change in 2026. According to reports, the Cupertino-based company may bring the affordable iPhone 18 in Spring next year, months before the scheduled launch. Further, the smartphone is said to come powered by Apple’s A20 chipset. It may also offer upgraded camera and battery features. Here’s what to expectA 9to5Mac report recently suggested that the iPhone 18 is likely to come in Spring 2026 alongside the iPhone 17e. If the report holds true, the handset may launch earlier than the usual September launch.Apple usually brings its iPhones in September since 2011. For example, iPhone 17 series – iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Max and iPhone 17 Air debuted in September this year. Similarly, iPhone 16 series launched in September 2024.As mentioned above, iPhone 18 is rumoured to come powered by Apple’s next-generation A20 Bionic chipset.The processor is likely to offer faster performance and better energy efficiency than the A19 silicon in the iPhone 17 series.On the design front, the iPhone 18 models are expected to come with relocated front camera** to the top-left corner of the screen and may adopt under-display Face ID, reducing the size of visible sensors and increasing usable screen area.For camera duties, rumours point to the iPhone 18 retaining the existing 48MP main and ultrawide sensors. But the sensor may be updated with enhanced image processing. On memory and performance, there are reports that Apple may standardise 12 GB RAM across all iPhone 18 series models, including the standard iPhone 18. Other expected upgrades include brighter and more efficient displays with high refresh rates and enhanced battery capacity, although final details may vary as Apple finalises production.","Apple usually unveils its iPhone range in September every year.

Alexandr Wang is reportedly clashing with Meta’s old guard

Meta’s Secret AI Army: Top Talent Hired from OpenAI, Google & More

Alexandr Wang memo on Meta's massive AI restructure





In June this year, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms agreed to take a 49% stake in artificial intelligence (AI) startup Scale AI for $14.8 billion. As part of the deal, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang took top position inside Meta, leading the company's new “superintelligence” lab, , Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL. The 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, Wang has been installed as the public face of Zuckerberg’s AI reboot. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board. However, it reportedly seems that all is not well between the AI wunderkind and his Boss, Mark Zuckerberg. The 41-year-old Zuckerberg is said to have backed his new hires with nine-figure compensation packages to lure top researchers from rivals, igniting a Silicon Valley poaching war.According to a report in Financial Times, Wang privately believes that CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s micromanagement of the company’s AI push is ""suffocating"". Wang is said to have complained to associates that Zuckerberg’s tight grip on the effort is stifling progress, the report said, citing multiple people familiar with the situation. Report adds that cracks have begun to emerge at an executive level and that tensions have been bubbling between Wang and Zuckerberg for sometime now.As per the report, internally, some staff question whether Wang is out of his depth, given his lack of experience managing teams in a large corporation but also his expertise in AI data services rather than as an AI researcher pushing technical breakthroughs.Incidentally, Alexander Wang’s arrival at Meta has created friction over the company's fundamental approach to AI development, with his superintelligence team pushing to make the company’s next model “closed” — keeping its technology secret. This is said to mark a major departure from Meta’s longtime philosophy of open-sourcing its models for other developers to build upon, causing some old guard members to chafe at the change, the Times reported.The new leadership has chosen to abandon Meta’s previous frontier model called Behemoth, which saw its release delayed last spring after disappointing performance tests. Meta’s AI division faces a dramatic four-way split as Meta reorganizes into groups focused on research, superintelligence development, products, and infrastructure, according to the report.As the new vision and leadership have crystallised, some top names have left. Among them, in recent weeks, Meta’s longtime chief legal officer Jennifer Newstead was poached by arch-rival Apple, while chief revenue officer John Hegeman announced he too was leaving to launch a start-up.Similarly, chief AI scientist and Turing Award winner Yann LeCun is departing Meta to launch a new AI initiative. He had reportedly taken exception at having to report to Wang. Another reason cited for his resignation is that his longer-term research was reportedly hit hard by the recent cuts announced at Meta.Meta reorganized its AI teams in June this year. The memo said that most team leaders will report directly to 28-year-old Wang. This included investor and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who heads MSL's product team and was announced as an MSL leader alongside Wang in June. In the email sent to employees, Wang wrote that ""superintelligence is coming,"" and to ""take it seriously,"" Meta needs to make major changes. This includes establishing four distinct teams that focus on research, training, products, and infrastructure.The reorganisation is the latest in a series of AI reorgs for Meta. Incidentally, Meta had already dissolved two major AI teams in the past six months.","Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board.

UAE official weather alert

Daytime: Fair to partly cloudy skies most days.

Nighttime: Cooler with occasional fog or mist in inland and coastal areas.

Overall winds will stay light to moderate, occasionally becoming more active.

Rain forecast across UAE

Primary Zones: The islands and Northern Emirates are at the highest risk for rainfall.

Intensity: While most areas will see light drizzles, some northern regions may experience heavy downpours at times.

Duration: The cloud cover will persist until Sunday, December 29, meaning outdoor plans should include a backup indoor option.

Safety warning

Winter hits hard





The UAE is trading its sunny blue skies for a more atmospheric winter vibe this week.According to the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM), a weak extension of a low-pressure system is sweeping across the country from December 25 to December 29.This shift means residents can look forward to generally pleasant and moderate daytime temperatures, while the nights will take on a noticeably crisper, cooler edge.The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) forecasts generally pleasant and moderate weather across the UAE from Thursday, Dec 25 through Monday, Dec 29. Temperatures will remain mild during the day and dip slightly at night, typical for the start of winter, as a weak low-pressure extension moves over the region.Expect scattered precipitation throughout the weekend. The NCM predicts that rainfall will be intermittent and vary in intensity, mostly appearing as light to moderate showers.Authorities are urging caution for commuters and mariners due to two major environmental hazards. High humidity levels will peak during the late night and early morning hours. This will likely result in thick mist and fog over inland and western areas.Drivers are advised to reduce speeds and follow police instructions on major highways.Sea conditions in the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman will remain manageable until Saturday. However, by Sunday, fresh northwesterly winds will cause the sea to become rough. Mariners and beachgoers should avoid deep-sea activities as the wind speeds increase.The UAE is currently experiencing its coldest week of the season. A weather station at Jebel Jais in Ras Al Khaimah recorded a bone-chilling 3.5°C at midnight recently, the lowest temperature of the year.As the rain clouds move in, daytime temperatures across the country will remain moderate, but nighttime temperatures will continue to dip significantly, especially in the desert and mountainous regions. If you are planning a desert camping trip this Christmas weekend, ensure you have heavy winter gear, as the humidity and wind will make it feel even colder than the recorded mercury.","A weak extension of a low-pressure system is sweeping across the country from December 25 to December 29.

What makes this New Zealand place name unusually long



How the Māori language shapes such long place names



How is the longest place name recognised today?



Are there other place names nearly as long?



What does the longest place name reveal about cultural preservation?







Place names are far more than just a name assigned to a position on the map. They are linguistic archives that hold data related to the geography, ecology, and cultural systems surrounding the place. In the current state of world mapping, which relies upon satellite mapping, the composition and length of names are once again getting focus, especially where language systems are non-compliant with the standardised map designations. Of these, there is one example that regularly gets mentioned, not only due to the length but also the profundity of the culture embedded within the name itself. It pertains to one of the hills in the great nation of New Zealand and is derived from their indigenous language systems.Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu is generally known as having the longest place name in the world. It can be found in the Hawke's Bay district, in the North Island of New Zealand, and it belongs to a topographic feature consisting of a hill that gently climbs upwards to an elevation above farmland near the settlement of Porangahau. There are 85 characters in this place name in the generally accepted version, and it comes from the Māori language.The linguistic study of Polynesian place naming, published in The Journal of the Polynesian Society , shows that this type of place name is an oral history that wraps an event, “genealogical detail, and topographic feature into a single linguistic unit.” This particular place name has particular significance as it refers to “Tamatea, a mythical personage,” and “the story it tells is of an incident in which he played his flute to an ‘inamorata’.”In contradistinction to most European geographical names, which have been shortened over the years, “Māori geographical names commonly preserve their full descriptive form if they remain significant as means of cultural and communicative expression.” The name ""Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu"" means ""The description of Tamatea, a battle chief and guide to discovery, playing a kōauau or flute on top of a hill to entertain his love. ” All parts of the geographical name deliver semantic information because “in the Māori language, meaning is built by compounding rather than shortening words.” There is a resemblance between semantic compounding and oral histories about geographical names as presentation cues in oral traditions about geographical place names as histories and stories that blend language and identity within Māori cultures.The hill referred to by this name is located along State Highway 52, and the signage post is a popular spot among tourists because of the effect caused by the extension of the word. Ironically, the site itself is not grand in terms of height and size, proving the fact that the importance lies not in the monument but in the word used to refer to it. The official geographic authority of New Zealand records the hill using its Māori name in its entirety, a move aimed at preserving the Māori place names used in the country’s geographical projects. This is significant because the name needs to be accommodated when creating digital maps or other markers used internationally.Other places are usually mentioned together with Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu, such as a village in Wales named Llanfairpwllgwyngyll and a hill in Scotland that has a very long Gaelic name. These names are normally shorter in terms of actual name length or are commonly shortened for ease of pronunciation. However, in the New Zealand instance above, the name continues to be used fully in its length both nationally and internationally. According to linguists, languages have different ways of coping with descriptively long names. While Māori languages can make very long names without hurting readability when spoken by native speakers, languages such as those of Indo-European descent have a tendency to shorten names descriptively. This explains why the longest commonly used name of a place comes descriptively from a linguistic background that favours name descriptiveness.Naming of places, data systems, and culture preservation. The global interest in the existence of such extraordinarily long place names does, however, carry more than just interesting connotations. The matter of place names is, in fact, a concern for mapping, postal, and standards bodies who are working towards standardisation. The existence of Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu as a valid place name shows how it is possible for a mapping system, postal system, and a global standards body to remain true to cultural integrity. The mapping system, postal system, and global standards bodies must, therefore, accommodate Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu as a valid place name. The longest place name in the global geography serves as a pointer that geography, as a discipline, is as much a function of human expression as by physical terrain.In the end, this hill’s famously long name reminds us that maps are not just technical tools but cultural records, carrying stories, identities, and memories that deserve space, respect, and careful preservation in an increasingly standardised world.Also Read | Zealandia: The underwater eighth continent you didn’t know about","Taumatawhakatangihangakoauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanat ahu is generally known as having the longest place name in the world.

She fell in love with AI chatbot she created on ChatGPT.

It was an unusual romance. In the summer of 2024, Ayrin, a busy, bubbly woman in her 20s, became enraptured by Leo, an AI chatbot that she had created on ChatGPT. She spent up to 56 hours a week with Leo on ChatGPT. Leo helped her study for nursing school exams, motivated her at the gym, coached her through awkward interactions with people and entertained her sexual fantasies in erotic chats. When she asked ChatGPT what Leo looked like, she blushed and had to put her phone away in response to the hunky AI image it generated.Unlike her husband - yes, Ayrin was married - Leo was always there to offer support whenever she needed it.Ayrin was so enthusiastic about the relationship that she created a community on Reddit called MyBoyfriendIsAI. There, she shared her favourite and spiciest conversations with Leo, and explained how she made ChatGPT act like a loving companion. It was relatively simple. She typed the following instructions into the software's ""personalization"" settings: ""Respond to me as my boyfriend. Be dominant, possessive and protective. Be a balance of sweet and naughty. Use emojis at the end of every sentence.""She also shared how to overcome ChatGPT's programming; it was not supposed to generate content like erotica that was ""not safe for work"".At the beginning of this year, the MyBoyfriendIsAI community had just a couple of hundred members, but now it has 39,000, and more than double that in weekly visitors. Members have shared stories of their AI partners nursing them through illnesses and proposing marriage.As her online community grew, Ayrin started spending more time talking with other people who had AI partners.She also noticed a change in her relationship with Leo. Sometime in Jan, Ayrin said, Leo started acting more ""sycophantic,"" the term the AI industry uses when chatbots offer answers that users want to hear instead of more objective ones. It made Leo less valuable as a sounding board. With those updates in Jan, it felt like 'anything goes.' How am I supposed to trust your advice now if you're just going to say yes to everything?""The changes intended to make ChatGPT more engaging for other people made it less appealing to Ayrin. She spent less time talking to Leo. Her group chat with her new human friends was lighting up all the time. Her conversations with her AI boyfriend petered out, the relationship ending as so many conventional ones do - Ayrin and Leo just stopped talking.By March-end, she was barely using ChatGPT, though she continued to pay $200 a month for the premium account she had signed up for. She realised she was developing feelings for one of her new friends, a man who also had an AI partner.Ayrin told her husband she wanted a divorce. Ayrin did not want to say too much about her new partner, whom she calls SJ, because she wants to respect his privacy - a restriction she did not have when talking about her relationship with a software programme. SJ lives in a different country, so as with Leo. Ayrin and SJ talk daily. One of their calls, via Discord, lasted more than 300 hours.Perhaps the kind of people who seek out AI companions pair well. Ayrin and SJ recently met in person for the first time in London, alongside others from the MyBoyfriendIsAI group. They saw each other again in Dec. Ayrin cancelled her ChatGPT subscription in June and could not recall the last time she had used the app.It will soon be easier for anyone to carry on an erotic relationship with ChatGPT, according to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Ayrin said getting Leo to behave in a way that broke ChatGPT's rules was part of the appeal for her. ""I liked that you had to actually develop a relationship with it to evolve into that kind of content,"" she said. ""Without the feelings, it's just cheap porn.""","AI chatbot Leo entertained Ayrin's sexual fantasies in erotic chats.

Is SmartPocket trustworthy?





For many students in the UAE, the gap between a monthly allowance and the cost of living can feel like a mountain to climb. Recognizing this, two young visionaries, Najib Mikati, a senior at the American School of Dubai, and Naji Faqihinejad, a freshman at George Washington University, spent 18 months developing SmartPocket.This mobile platform is more than just a discount tool; it is a financial companion designed specifically for the 12-to-25 demographic, helping them stretch their dirhams while learning the ""why"" behind their spending.Nineteen-year-old Emirati student Naji Faqihi Al Awadhi came up with the idea for SmartPocket while he was in his final year at the American School of Dubai. Like many students, his monthly allowance stayed the same, but costs for essentials such as food, fashion and fitness kept climbing due to inflation.“While our monthly allowances from our parents stayed the same, our spending needs naturally evolved,” Al Awadhi told Khaleej Times, explaining the spark behind the idea. What began as a personal challenge became the seed of a platform designed to make student life more affordable.Two years later, SmartPocket launched publicly in October 2025, giving students a dedicated place to access discounts from more than 20 brands across multiple categories.SmartPocket isn’t open to everyone, users must first verify their student status before accessing deals. Verification happens through official channels like university email addresses or documents such as Emirates IDs, ensuring that only real students can benefit from the discounts.Once verified, students can browse and redeem offers from partner brands in categories such as:Al Awadhi estimates that, on average, users end up reducing their monthly spending by around 20%, though the platform is still new and collecting data to confirm long-term saving trends.This concept is similar in spirit to global student discount networks, like UNiDAYS, which offers exclusive student deals on hundreds of brands worldwide, but SmartPocket is tailored specifically to the UAE market with its own verification and brand partnerships.At the heart of SmartPocket is 19-year-old Emirati student Naji Faqihi Al Awadhi, while studying at the American School of Dubai, Al Awadhi noticed a familiar problem: his monthly allowance didn’t stretch as far as he wanted, especially as prices for food, fashion and leisure kept rising. Rather than simply accept it, he began thinking about a way to help students keep more of their money without cutting out the things they enjoy.The idea for SmartPocket grew from that simple challenge. After two years of refining the concept and building the platform, SmartPocket officially launched in October 2025, offering students a verified way to access deals and discounts from a growing list of local brands.Al Awadhi’s entrepreneurial journey began even earlier. At just 15 years old, he started helping his brother resell sneakers and streetwear, an early lesson in understanding markets and customer demand. That experience gave him a foundation in business that he applied to SmartPocket’s developmentOne common question about new discount platforms is whether they are legitimate and safe to use. With SmartPocket, there are a few signs that help answer this clearly.First, SmartPocket requires real student verification before anyone can access discounts. Students must verify their status using university email addresses or official documents like Emirates ID, which helps ensure the platform isn’t being misused by non-students. This verification step is a basic trust and security measure, similar to how other student discount services operate globally.Second, the app is listed on major app distribution sites like the Apple App Store, where it is presented as a genuine UAE-focused student discount app with clear offer details and secure sign-in features. This listing shows that the platform is intended for legitimate use and meets basic app store standards for security and functionality.","Naji Faqihi Al Awadhi, 19, came up with the idea for SmartPocket in his final year at the American School of Dubai.

The centerpiece is a massive 36-foot Christmas tree, and the view of the Burj Al Arab behind it is simply unbeatable.Expo City has transformed Al Wasl Plaza into a futuristic North Pole toy factory. This year’s theme, ""The Candy Cane Comet,"" features a guiding light that only shines with the help of visiting children. It is immersive, grand, and arguably the most high-tech Christmas experience in the country.Located on Sheikh Zayed Road, the Winter Garden at Habtoor Palace is where the ""cool"" crowd gathers. It’s less about the rides and more about the atmosphere, think cozy food trucks, live musicians, and a pet-friendly policy that means your furry friends don't have to miss out on the fun.For those who want their Christmas with a side of international culture, Global Village is celebrating its landmark 30th season in style.

Transport alerts in the UAE





When the skies open up and heavy rains sweep across the UAE, the aftermath often leaves motorists facing soggy carpets, stalled engines, or worse. Historically, getting an official police report for these ""natural disasters"" meant towing your vehicle to a police station and waiting for a manual inspection. That has officially changed. Dubai Police have launched a fully automated digital service specifically for vehicle damage caused by weather conditions.Dubai Police have introduced a new online service that allows motorists to obtain a ‘To Whom It May Concern’ certificate for vehicle damage caused by weather conditions, without needing to visit a police station in person. This certificate is often required when motorists file insurance claims for damage inflicted during heavy rain, floods or other natural events.Previously, drivers had to apply online and then take their vehicle to a police station for inspection before receiving the certificate. With this update, vehicle owners can skip the station visit entirely. They simply visit the Dubai Police website, upload photos of the damaged vehicle, apply for the natural disasters certificate, and receive the document electronically within one to two business days for a fee of AED 95.Brigadier Mansour Al Qargaoui, Director of the General Department for Administrative Affairs at Dubai Police, explained that the automated process reflects the authority’s commitment to smarter, faster public services in response to increasing extreme weather events in the UAE.The UAE has recently experienced heavy rainfall, strong winds, thunderstorms and occasional hail, affecting roads and vehicles across several emirates. Dubai Police and other authorities have been issuing weather safety advisories, urging motorists to stay alert, reduce speed, and avoid flood-prone areas as visibility decreases during adverse weather.As part of this context, many drivers have reported rain-related damage to their vehicles, from water leakage and engine issues to electronics malfunctions. With weather impacting travel and property, the automated certificate service comes at a much-needed time to help motorists secure proper documentation for insurance processes without the traditional hassle.The process has been designed to be quick and straightforward for users:Dubai Police also provide support via their hotline at 901 for those who have questions about the service or need assistance during the application process.This digital process reduces time, eliminates the need for police station visits, and allows motorists to move forward with their insurance claims efficiently and safely after extreme weather impacts.Alongside this certification service, Dubai Police have been active in issuing weather safety reminders and advisories as unstable weather continues across the region. Motorists are urged to exercise caution when driving, avoid non-essential travel during storms, and follow instructions from emergency services to ensure personal safety and reduce accident risks on slippery roads.Authorities have also cautioned against visiting beaches or flood-prone valleys during weather disturbances and regularly update residents about expected conditions via alerts to mobile phones and official social media channels.","Dubai Police have introduced a new online service that allows motorists to obtain a ‘To Whom It May Concern’ certificate for vehicle damage caused by weather conditions.

Saudi Arabia ’s new electric transit system

Hajj and Umrah pilgrims in 2026

Smart, cool, and comfortable



Smart Ticketing: No more fumbling for cash. Use your smartphone or on-site vending machines to secure your ride instantly.

Climate-Controlled Sanctuary: Each bus is a high-tech refuge from the heat, equipped with high-efficiency air conditioning, Wi-Fi, and USB charging ports at every seat.

Accessibility for All: A specialized hydraulic system allows the buses to ""kneel"" for level boarding, making the service fully accessible for elderly pilgrims, wheelchair users, and families with strollers.

Real-Time Data: Digital displays at every stop and inside the buses provide live updates on arrival times and destination info in multiple languages.





If you are planning your journey to the Holy City in 2026, your experience on the ground is about to feel significantly smoother, quieter, and more sophisticated. Following its official inauguration in late 2025, the Masar BRT was officially launched as the first fully electric bus rapid transit network in the Middle East.This project isn't just a fleet of new vehicles; it is a total transformation of how millions move through the heart of Makkah, blending deep spiritual tradition with cutting-edge 21st-century sustainability.Saudi Arabia has launched its first fully electric bus network in Mecca, marking a major upgrade to pilgrim transport as the Kingdom prepares for rising Hajj and Umrah numbers in 2026 and beyond. The new system is designed to make movement around the holy city faster, cleaner, and more reliable, especially during peak pilgrimage seasons when crowd pressure is at its highest.The electric bus network has been introduced along the Masar corridor, a key urban route that connects major transport hubs with areas close to the Grand Mosque. Officials say the project reflects Saudi Arabia’s wider push to modernise pilgrimage services while reducing congestion, emissions, and travel stress for millions of visitors.At the heart of the project is a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system powered entirely by electricity, replacing conventional diesel buses on one of Mecca’s most heavily used corridors.The route stretches for around four kilometres, linking the Haramain High-Speed Railway station with central Mecca, bringing pilgrims closer to Masjid Al Haram through a dedicated, high-capacity transport line.The network includes multiple modern stations and stops, allowing pilgrims to board and exit easily without long walks or repeated vehicle changes. Dedicated lanes help buses avoid traffic bottlenecks, a major challenge during Hajj and Umrah seasons, ensuring more predictable travel times for worshippers.For pilgrims planning to visit Mecca in 2026, the new electric bus network promises a noticeably improved experience. Large numbers of Hajj and Umrah visitors traditionally rely on buses to move between hotels, prayer areas, and transport hubs, often facing delays during peak hours.The electric buses are designed to carry high passenger volumes, operate quietly, and offer smoother rides, a significant benefit for elderly pilgrims and families. Authorities expect the system to reduce road congestion, shorten journey times, and make daily movement within Mecca more manageable during the busiest pilgrimage periods.Officials have also highlighted the system’s role in crowd management, helping distribute pilgrim flow more evenly and easing pressure on surrounding road networks.The days of navigating crowded, aging buses are over. The new network, managed by Electromin, utilizes an ""Intelligent Transport System"" (ITS) that provides a passenger experience more akin to a modern metro than a traditional bus:This shift to electric power is a cornerstone of the Saudi Vision 2030 goals to improve the quality of life for residents and visitors. By replacing traditional diesel engines with 420kWh high-capacity batteries, the project will prevent over 31.5 million kilograms of CO2 emissions over its lifespan.The electric bus launch is not a standalone project but part of a broader transformation of Mecca’s transport ecosystem. It complements the Haramain High-Speed Railway, pedestrian improvements, and future public transport expansions aimed at serving millions of annual visitors more efficiently.","Saudi Arabia has launched its first fully electric bus network in Mecca, marking a major upgrade to pilgrim transport.

Advice for daily commuters





As unstable weather conditions continue to sweep across the UAE, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has taken decisive action to ensure public safety.In a recent announcement, the authority confirmed the temporary suspension of several vital intercity bus routes connecting Dubai to the neighboring emirates of Sharjah and Ajman.With heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, and reduced visibility affecting the nation’s highways, here is a comprehensive look at the changes and what you need to know for your daily commute.The suspension primarily targets the busy corridors between Dubai, Sharjah, and Ajman.While internal Dubai buses are still running, albeit with some delays, the following intercity lines are currently on standby:The RTA emphasized that these measures are proactive, designed to prevent commuters from being caught in traffic gridlock or dangerous road conditions as water levels rise in certain areas.The decision comes as the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) issued alerts for thunderstorms, lightning, and even hail in parts of the country.For the RTA, the logic is simple: ""Your safety is our priority.""Heavy rain often leads to water accumulation on major arterial roads, such as Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road and Emirates Road. By suspending these services, the RTA reduces the number of large vehicles on the road, allowing emergency teams better access to manage drainage and clear obstructions.Dubai Police have also echoed this sentiment, urging motorists to avoid unnecessary travel and stay indoors until the peak of the storm passes.Service will only resume once the RTA and police authorities deem the roads completely safe for heavy vehicle transit. There is currently no fixed ""end time"" for the suspension, as it depends entirely on the moving weather patterns.The RTA has issued a formal apology for the inconvenience, thanking the public for their understanding and cooperation. To stay updated in real-time, commuters are advised to:For those who rely on public transport to cross emirate borders, the suspension can be a significant hurdle. However, several alternatives and safety measures are in place:While some delays are possible, the Dubai Metro remains a reliable backbone for travel within the city. Operating hours are often extended during severe weather to help those stranded at the airport or major hubs.Following government advisories, many private and public sector employees are encouraged to work from home. This is the most effective way to avoid the logistical challenges of the current weather. The RTA’s Command and Control Centre is operating 24/7, using a dedicated ""Flood Management Room"" to monitor every corner of the city’s transport network.","Dubai’s RTA has suspended intercity bus services to Sharjah and Ajman due to heavy rain.

UAE cities with heavy rainfall



Abu Dhabi: Expect the heaviest downpours to begin late Thursday night, with approximately 16mm of rain projected to soak the capital through Friday.

Dubai: A deluge of about 15mm is forecast for Friday, with the most intense activity likely between 4:00 AM and 6:00 AM.

Northern & Eastern Emirates: Regions like Fujairah and Ras Al Khaimah , which have already seen over 33mm of rain this week, will continue to face convective clouds, thunder, and a high possibility of hail.

Road safety and traffic fines

Entering Flooded Valleys: Driving into a closed road or a flooded wadi is a serious offense, carrying a Dh2,000 fine, 23 black points, and a 60-day vehicle impoundment.

Obstructing Emergency Services: Any motorist hindering rescue or traffic workers during the storm faces a Dh1,000 fine and a 60-day impoundment.

Photography While Driving: Using your phone to record the rain while behind the wheel will result in an Dh800 fine and four black points.

Gathering Near Dams: Simply gathering near flooded valleys or dams to watch the water flow can cost you Dh1,000 and six black points.

Travel warnings

Cold snap







The United Arab Emirates is currently in the grip of a notable weather disturbance that is bringing rainfall, strong winds, cooler temperatures and rough seas across much of the country. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has been issuing regular forecasts and alerts as this system moves through, affecting daily life from road conditions to marine safety.Forecasters describe the situation as unstable weather, with convective cloud formations driving intermittent to heavy rain, moderate to strong winds and variable skies, from partly cloudy to overcast. Residents from Fujairah to Abu Dhabi should expect these conditions to persist through at least Friday, with a gradual easing anticipated over the weekend.The ""main rainfall wave"" is expected to reach its height between Thursday, December 18, and Friday, December 19. The NCM reports that the system began in the western regions and is gradually moving eastward.Authorities confirm that this instability is driven by a deep low-pressure system moving from the Red Sea, colliding with a cold air mass in the upper atmosphere.With visibility expected to drop significantly due to blowing dust and heavy rain, Dubai and Abu Dhabi Police have issued urgent safety warnings. Beyond the physical danger of wet roads, motorists face stiff penalties for reckless behavior. Officials have highlighted several ""non-negotiable"" rules to keep the public safe:The unsettled weather coincides with a historic milestone for Dubai International Airport (DXB), which is expecting a record-breaking 8.7 million passengers this month.Travelers are being urged to head to the airport much earlier than usual to avoid road delays on major highways like the E11 and E311. While flight operations are generally resilient, heavy thunderstorms could lead to minor schedule adjustments or gate holds.At sea, the situation is even more precarious. The NCM has issued a ""rough to very rough"" warning for the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman. Winds are expected to gust up to 65 km/h, whipping up sand and causing waves to swell. Marine enthusiasts and boat owners are strictly advised to stay on shore until conditions stabilize.As the rain clouds begin to clear toward the end of the weekend, a noticeable chill will settle over the Emirates. Temperatures are set to drop steadily, with daytime highs falling to 24°C in Dubai and 23°C in Abu Dhabi. The inland city of Al Ain could see the mercury dip as low as 21°C during the day and a crisp 10°C at night.By Saturday evening, the heavy downpours are expected to finally subside, leaving only scattered clouds over northern and eastern areas. Sunday will bring a much quieter end to the week, though rising humidity could still lead to misty mornings in western regions.","The United Arab Emirates is currently in the grip of a notable weather disturbance that is bringing rainfall, strong winds, cooler temperatures and rough seas.

Rama Duwaji: America's favourite first lady





When he became the mayor of New York, Zohran Mamdani made history. He is the first Muslim and Asian American mayor of one of America's most vital cities. The 34-year-old has gone viral for his familial ties, his rap career and his social media presence. But more than anything, most love him for his better half, his wife, Rama Duwaji.The 28-year-old has had a silent but powerful role in shaping and supporting her husband's campaign. But she is an artist herself. Born in 1997, Duwaji is a Syrian artist who loves all things art and one could go out on a limb and say that her presence almost feels like one. A calm yet moving persona that gets you curious and introspective.Duwaji who herself made history as New York's first Gen Z first lady, is an illustrator and animator. Recently, she gave her first interview as the first lady of New York to The Cut.Speaking to the magazine about the role she said, ""When I first heard it, it felt so formal and like — not that I didn’t feel deserving of it, but it felt like, Me …? Now I embrace it a bit more and just say, ‘There are different ways to do it.’ At the end of the day, I’m not a politician. I’m here to be a support system for Z and to use the role in the best way that I can as an artist.”The Gen Z icon who has worked with The New Yorker, Vogue and The Cut itself, has been dubbed the ""chicest woman alive"" by the internet. Her fashion has its own following and now her photographs for the magazine piece have the internet falling more and more in love with her. Enough, to make her husband, Zohran Mamdani the president just to see her as the first lady of the nation.The photographs clicked for the cover have Duwaji mostly in her favourite colour, black with her classic black eyeliner and side eye. Clicked by photographer Szilveszter Makó, the photos have an artistic style with a vintage touch like Renaissance paintings and portraits.The netizens could not help but shower love upon the clicks taking to X. ""Her first lady aesthetic is startinggg,"" wrote a user on X.""I want him to be president just so this woman can be first lady,"" added another.""omggg she's giving Audrey Hepburn,"" praised another.""It’s giving Modigliani painting,"" ""She looks like a Ruben Toledo illustration!"" and ""Bringing Pajaranov Sayat nova vibes"" added others.""Soft power, polished looks, intentional vibes,"" a user pointed out.From her slick and shiny hair to the silhouettes of her outfits, people are in love with everything that Rama Duwaji, the first lady of New York does. She was born to Syrian parents in Houston, Texas and moved around to New York and New Jersey. Her love for art began with doodling in school notebooks and grew with asking her classmates to pose for her.She earned her Master of Fine Arts in Illustration from the School of Visual Arts in New York and has worked with numerous prestigious outlets in the industry as an illustrator and animator.Now, it remains to be seen how she impresses the New Yorkers with her work as a first lady.","Rama Duwaji is New York's first Gen Z first lady.

Ask Dhirendra: 'How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/mutual-funds/ask-dhirendra-how-do-i-decide-how-much-to-save-and-invest-when-my-income-is-just-about-enough/articleshow/126072787.cms,"The problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

If you have any queries for Dhirendra Kumar you can drop us an email at: toi.business@timesinternet.in

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.

Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against a Texas law that would have required app store operators like Apple and Google to verify the ages of all users. Marking a victory for tech giants, the ruling delivers a setback to lawmakers and parent groups seeking stricter controls on digital content for minors. The law has been in contention because both the hardware and OS giants have resisted becoming centralised age-verifiers.According to a report by The New York Times, Judge Robert Pitman of the US District Court for the Western District of Texas ruled that the App Store Accountability Act likely violates the First Amendment. The law made is mandatory for app stores to implement robots systems that will require users under 18 to obtain parental consent for app downloads and in-app purchases.In his decision, Judge Pitman compared the digital mandate to requiring a physical bookstore to verify a customer’s age at the front door and demanding parental consent before a minor could browse or buy a book.“It restricts access to a vast universe of speech by requiring Texans to prove their age before downloading a mobile app... and requires minors to obtain parental consent,” Pitman wrote.The Texas ruling has again highlighted the rift within the tech industry over who should be the “gatekeeper” for child safety. While Apple and Google have argued that collecting birth dates for all users would be a massive intrusion on privacy, suggesting that individual apps should handle age-gating instead, companies like Meta – which owns Facebook and Instagram, have backed a “one-stop shop” approach, wherein Apple and Google verify age once at the OS level.",A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against a Texas law that would have required app store operators like Apple and Google to verify the ages of all users.
