Browns’ 2025 quarterback battle and the potential 2026 Cade Klubnik draft pick



Shedeur Sanders is in a QB competition with Dillon Gabriel! | NFL Live

The Cleveland Browns are entering the 2025 NFL season with one of the most crowded and uncertain quarterback rooms in the league. After using two draft picks on promising young signal-callers, Dillon Gabriel in the third round and Shedeur Sanders in the fifth, the Browns have signaled a clear desire to find their next franchise quarterback. However, with veterans Kenny Pickett and Joe Flacco also competing, and star Deshaun Watson sidelined for the season with a torn Achilles, the battle for the starting QB spot is anything but settled.Dillon Gabriel, taken in the third round, and Shedeur Sanders, a fifth-round pick, both bring promising skill sets but have yet to prove they can lead an NFL offense long-term. Gabriel’s strong arm and pocket presence contrast with Sanders’ exciting dual-threat ability and high-profile college career. Meanwhile, Pickett and Flacco offer experience but are unlikely to be long-term answers. With Watson sidelined, the Browns have no clear-cut starter, making this quarterback competition one of the fiercest in the NFL.Looking beyond 2025, the Browns may still be searching for stability at quarterback. College Football Network’s Max Dorsey predicts Cleveland could select highly in the 2026 NFL Draft, targeting Clemson’s Cade Klubnik, one of the top quarterback prospects.Klubnik impressed in 2024 with 36 touchdown passes, only six interceptions, and a dynamic running ability that makes him a dual-threat talent. His steady improvement in footwork and composure makes him a likely first-round pick and a potential franchise quarterback.If Gabriel and Sanders fail to meet expectations this season, the Browns might pivot to Klubnik next year, signaling another quarterback overhaul. This uncertainty underscores the Browns’ ongoing quarterback challenges and the high stakes of their 2025 roster decisions.Also Read: Bill Belichick’s alleged engagement to 24-year-old Jordon Hudson raises eyebrows after ring photo surfaces For Browns fans, the next season will be critical. Whether it’s Dillon Gabriel, Shedeur Sanders, or a future star like Cade Klubnik, Cleveland’s quarterback saga remains the defining story of the franchise’s future and a must-watch drama in the NFL landscape.","The Cleveland Browns are entering the 2025 NFL season with one of the most crowded and uncertain quarterback rooms in the league.

Answers for Today's Connections (May 26, 2025)

Explanation of Today's answers

NYT Connections is back with another exciting wordplay. Today’s edition of the puzzle has plenty to keep even seasoned solvers on their toes. With tricky wordplay and overlapping themes, it’s easy to get thrown off track without a nudge in the right direction. Whether you're stuck on that one frustrating category or just want to check your answers, you’ll find everything you need right here. Below, we break down the day’s puzzle with category hints, the final answers and a bit of context to help sharpen your solving skills going forward.Connections is a daily word game by the New York Times where players are challenged to identify four groups of four related words. The connections between the words might be thematic, categorical, or linguistic. Popular for its mix of logic, language skills and occasional trickery, it’s become a fan-favourite puzzle that resets each day at midnight.You are presented with 16 words and must group them into four sets of four based on a shared connection. These groups might be straightforward (like colours or animals) or involve more subtle wordplay (such as changing a letter). Select four words you believe belong together and click “submit.” If correct, the group is locked in. You have four chances before the game ends. Use the shuffle option to reorganize the board, which can help reveal new connections.Yellow group — Items in a linen closet:PILLOWCASE, SHEET, TOWEL, WASHCLOTHGreen group — Diametric (words meaning opposite):COUNTER, OPPOSITE, POLAR, REVERSEBlue group — Lingerie:GARTER, HOSE, SLIP, TEDDYPurple group — Card games with first letter changed:DIN (Gin), FRIDGE (Bridge), GUMMY (Rummy), JOKER (Poker)The yellow group was fairly straightforward: these are all soft, fabric-based items commonly found in a household linen closet.The green group involved conceptual opposites, with each word representing some form of contrast or reversal.The blue group leaned into fashion, specifically intimate apparel or lingerie, which made for a cohesive theme but may have tricked those unfamiliar with the terms.The purple group was the hardest of all, relying on wordplay—each word is a spoof of a well-known card game with the first letter changed. This type of linguistic twist is a signature move for the purple tier and often trips up even frequent players.Today’s Connections puzzle offered a fun blend of clarity and confusion. If you missed the card game twist or got caught mixing household items with fashion, you’re not alone. With daily practice and a growing familiarity with the puzzle’s tricks, each game becomes a bit easier. Come back tomorrow for a fresh challenge and keep that winning streak going!","Connections is a daily word game by the New York Times.

How the new WhatsApp scam works

How to protect yourself from this WhatsApp scam

Key preventive measures include:

Verify Senders : Always be suspicious of images or messages from unknown numbers. Even if it appears to be from a known contact, if the message seems unusual or out of character, verify it through another communication channel before interacting.

: Always be suspicious of images or messages from unknown numbers. Even if it appears to be from a known contact, if the message seems unusual or out of character, verify it through another communication channel before interacting. Avoid Unknown Downloads: Refrain from downloading any images or attachments from suspicious or unverified sources.

Report Scam Messages: If you receive a message that you suspect is a scam, report it to WhatsApp and block the sender immediately.

A new type of WhatsApp scam is now doing the rounds on the internet. A seemingly innocent act –downloading a funny meme or image on WhatsApp – could be the gateway for fraudsters to compromise your entire digital life, from your bank account to your most private photos. The new scam works on the common habit of sharing and downloading images shared on WhatsApp. Users receive an image, seemingly harmless and perhaps even from a known contact, which, upon download, unleashes malware or spyware onto their mobile device. The deceptive nature of the attack lies in its ability to bypass traditional suspicions, as users are less likely to question content that appears to be a simple picture or meme.Users will receive a meme or image from an unknown number or their own phone contact whose phone may be already compromised. Once the user downloads the image, the malware silently installs on their phone allowing the hackers to steal their banking credentials, social media passwords and also their personal photos.The images shared by hackers often contain some hidden QR codes that redirect the users to phishing websites and expose them to financial fraud. The scam spreads as users unknowingly forward infected images, making them carriers of the malware.Cybersecurity experts are urging WhatsApp users to exercise extreme caution to avoid falling victim to this scam. Pranav Patil, Chief Data Scientist, AdvaRisk told Economic Times, “In today’s world, where messaging apps are ubiquitous, scammers are increasingly turning to social engineering tactics to exploit users.

In a first-of-its-kind event, humanoid robots took center stage in a kickboxing match in Hangzhou, China. The competition, part of the China Media Group (CMG) World Robot Competition – Mecha Fighting Series, was held on May 25 and marked the debut of robotic fighters in a full-fledged combat sport.The robots were developed by Unitree Robotics, a Chinese tech company known for its advanced humanoid machines. Four Unitree G1 robots took part in the fight, each about 132 centimeters tall and weighing 35 kilograms, reported Asia Times.They were remotely controlled by human trainers using joysticks, and the match was broadcasted by China Central Television (CCTV).While the event sparked excitement among viewers, one social media user commented humorously, “The part that confuses me most is the referee in the ring.”Videos from the match showed the robots exchanging punches and kicks with surprising coordination. Although the strikes were more like soft pushes than real hits, the movements displayed impressive balance and speed for machines.The match was part of a larger effort to test and showcase the growing abilities of AI and robotics in dynamic settings.Earlier this year, a Unitree robot was seen in a viral video aggressively reacting to its handlers during a demo, raising safety concerns.In another case, during February’s Spring Festival Gala in Tianjin, a robot reportedly charged toward a crowd, alarming attendees.Such incidents, including a recent case at Tesla's factory in Texas where a robot allegedly injured a worker, have sparked growing concern over AI safety and the potential risks of advanced robotics. Experts have pointed to software glitches and inadequate testing as common causes, highlighting the need for strict quality control in AI development."," humanoid robots took center stage in a kickboxing match in Hangzhou, China.

The popular instant messaging app has now teased a dedicated iPad app. The official WhatsApp account on X (formerly Twitter) recently responded with an ""eyes"" emoji to a user's plea for an iPad app, hinting that Apple iPad users may soon get to use the much-awaited iPad app for WhatsApp.For nearly two years, a native WhatsApp app for iPadOS has been in beta testing via Apple's TestFlight program. While the beta program is currently at capacity, preventing new testers from joining, those who have had access report a largely stable experience. This extended testing period suggests that Meta , WhatsApp's parent company, is meticulously working to ensure a robust and seamless user experience before a wider rollout.The forthcoming iPad app is expected to offer users the ability to access their WhatsApp conversations independently, even when their iPhone is not connected to the internet. This "" companion mode "" functionality mirrors the experience currently available on WhatsApp for desktop and web, allowing messages and calls to remain end-to-end encrypted across linked devices. The interface is anticipated to be optimised for the iPad's larger display, providing a more intuitive and visually appealing experience than simply using the iPhone app or the web version.As of now, an official public release date for the WhatsApp iPad app has not been announced.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct.

After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What Google DeepMind CEO told University of Cambridge students

Demis Hassabis , CEO of Google DeepMind , announced at the Google I/O developer conference recently that the research lab is less than 10 years away from achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI), the ultimate goal of the ongoing generative AI arms race. Speaking live, Hassabis emphasized the transformative potential of AI, predicting significant workplace disruption but also the creation of new, valuable, and engaging jobs within the next five to 10 years.Hassabis, who leads Google’s AI initiatives including the Gemini chatbot, advised young people, particularly college students, to “immerse” themselves in AI technologies and become proficient in using cutting-edge tools. “Whatever happens with these AI tools, you’ll be better off understanding how they work and what you can do with them,” he said, urging students to focus on “learning to learn” to stay adaptable in a rapidly changing technological landscape.In an earlier interview at the University of Cambridge, where Hassabis graduated, he shared similar advice with students, emphasizing adaptability as a critical skill. Responding to questions submitted by undergraduates, he encouraged them to understand their learning styles and develop the ability to quickly master new material. “The world you’re entering will face an incredible amount of disruption and change,” he told students during a March discussion with Professor Alastair Beresford at Queens’ College, Cambridge.Hassabis highlighted emerging fields like AI, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and quantum computing as promising industries over the next decade. He noted that technological shifts historically disrupt some jobs but create others that are often more interesting and valuable, as discussed on the “Hard Fork” podcast with hosts Kevin Roose and Casey Newton.The generative AI race, sparked by OpenAI’s ChatGPT release in 2022, has fueled rapid advancements, raising both excitement and concerns about its impact on society. Hassabis stressed that students should combine their passions with core skills to seize opportunities in this evolving landscape. “Anytime there is change, there is also huge opportunity,” he said, encouraging graduates to blend deep knowledge of their interests with adaptability to thrive in an AI-driven future.""Over the next 5 to 10 years, I think we're going to find what normally happens with big new technology shifts, which is that some jobs get disrupted,"" he recently told co-hosts Kevin Roose and Casey Newton on an episode of ""Hard Fork,"" a podcast about the future of technology. However, he said, ""new, more valuable, usually more interesting jobs get created"" in the wake of that kind of disruption.","Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, spoke at the Google I/O developer conference.

Warning: spoilers ahead.Connections is a daily word puzzle published by The New York Times . You are given 16 words and must group them into four sets of four words, where each set shares a common theme. Themes can relate to meanings, categories, idioms, or even subtle wordplay. Each puzzle has only one correct solution, making precision and logic key to winning.The puzzle presents a 4x4 grid of words. Your job is to find four groups of four words that connect through a shared idea. You can rearrange the words to help visualise patterns, and you're allowed four incorrect guesses. Groups are colour-coded by difficulty:Yellow – easiestGreen – moderateBlue – harderPurple – trickiest, often involving wordplay or double meaningsSubmit four words you believe belong together. If correct, that group locks in. If not, you lose a life.

xAI’s Grok 3 AI models now available on Microsoft Azure

Technical insights into Grok 3.5

Significance of the Microsoft-xAI collaboration

Free access to Grok AI on Azure available this June

Future outlook and industry impact

Also read | Elon Musk under fire: Senators demand investigation into Starlink trade deals

In a notable event at the Microsoft Build 2025 developer conference, Elon Musk , CEO of xAI and Tesla, joined Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to announce the integration of xAI’s flagship Grok 3 AI models on Microsoft Azure. This announcement marks a significant step in the evolving artificial intelligence landscape, bringing together two major technology powerhouses. The Grok models will be accessible for free throughout June on the Azure AI Foundry platform, which also features AI offerings from industry leaders such as OpenAI, Meta, and Hugging Face.This collaboration highlights not only technological innovation but also the historical ties between Musk and Microsoft, recalling Musk’s early programming days as a Microsoft intern. This detailed report covers all aspects of the announcement, the technology behind Grok, the significance of this partnership, and the future prospects of AI development on Azure.During the Build conference, Satya Nadella took a moment to reflect on Elon Musk’s early career. Nadella reminded the audience of Musk’s internship at Microsoft, stating,Musk responded warmly, sharing memories of his beginnings before Windows with MS-DOS on the earliest IBM PCs. He highlighted the technological limitations of that era, recalling how memory upgrades from 128k to 256k were significant milestones. Musk also described programming video games in DOS and later working with Windows 3.1, emphasizing his foundational experience in software development which shaped his future ventures.The core of the announcement focused on the launch of Grok 3, xAI’s advanced family of AI models, now integrated with Microsoft Azure’s cloud infrastructure. Nadella introduced Grok as “a family of models that are both responsive and capable of reasoning,” expressing enthusiasm about its deployment on Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft’s AI platform that offers scalable, managed AI services to developers and enterprises worldwide.The availability of Grok 3 and Grok 3 Mini on Azure aims to broaden access to cutting-edge AI capabilities. Microsoft will provide these models with service-level agreements consistent with their other AI offerings, and billing will be streamlined through Microsoft’s standard Azure framework. This ensures ease of integration for enterprises already operating within the Azure ecosystem.Elon Musk elaborated on the forthcoming Grok 3.5 model during the conversation. He described it as an AI designed to “reason from first principles,” a philosophical approach emphasizing fundamental truths and axioms as the basis for knowledge and problem-solving. Musk explained that the model’s architecture is grounded in fundamental physics, allowing it to apply these principles across different reasoning domains with an aim to minimize error and approach accurate understanding.This emphasis on physics-based reasoning sets Grok apart from many AI models that rely primarily on pattern recognition and statistical inference. By integrating first-principles reasoning, Grok 3.5 aspires to provide more reliable, consistent outputs, potentially enhancing applications across diverse fields such as autonomous vehicles, space exploration, and customer service.The integration of Grok into Azure represents a strategic alliance that leverages Microsoft’s extensive cloud infrastructure and xAI’s innovative AI research. This collaboration extends the reach of Musk’s xAI beyond standalone systems, embedding it within one of the largest and most trusted cloud platforms globally.Azure AI Foundry already hosts models from major AI developers like OpenAI, Meta, and Hugging Face, making it a hub for AI innovation and adoption. Grok’s addition to this ecosystem reflects Microsoft’s commitment to providing diverse AI options to developers and enterprises.The partnership also comes amid industry discussions regarding the influence of large tech firms on AI development. Musk’s previous criticisms of Microsoft’s role in OpenAI’s operations add a layer of complexity to this collaboration, underscoring the nuanced relationships shaping the AI industry.Microsoft announced that Grok models will be available free of charge throughout June, allowing developers, researchers, and businesses to explore and experiment with xAI’s technology. This limited free access serves to increase adoption and foster community feedback, critical for refining AI capabilities and expanding real-world applications.Post-June, Grok’s services will continue under Microsoft’s commercial terms, integrated fully within the Azure billing and support system.

John Tavares won’t chase NHL free agency and expected to re-sign with Maple Leafs despite bigger offers waiting on the NHL open market,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/john-tavares-wont-chase-nhl-free-agency-and-expected-to-re-sign-with-maple-leafs-despite-bigger-offers-waiting-on-the-nhl-open-market/articleshow/121421629.cms,"John Tavares hopes to stay in Toronto with new deal: Report (Image Source: Getty Images)

Why John Tavares could make more money elsewhere but probably won’t leave



What the Maple Leafs are willing to offer and why it matters for their cap space



If John Tavares wanted to chase the biggest bag possible, he could easily test the NHL free-agent market and get snapped up in a heartbeat. But Tavares isn’t really about that right now. The Maple Leafs captain seems focused on staying put in Toronto, even if that means leaving money on the table. So, what’s driving this loyalty, and what kind of deal are we actually talking about? Let’s break it all down.Tavares’ contract is up after the 2024–25 season, and technically, he could walk into free agency and score himself a pretty sweet deal. We’re talking $7–8 million per year, even at age 35, because veteran centers with playoff experience are always in demand. Teams across the league would pay top dollar for his leadership and offensive skills, even if his point totals have slightly dipped in recent years.Tavares has repeatedly made it clear that he wants to stay with the Leafs. In his own words, he’s “very optimistic” that things will work out, and the front office seems to be on the same page. This is about more than just money, it’s about finishing what he started in Toronto and making a real push for a Stanley Cup.Now, here’s where it gets tricky: the Maple Leafs have a tight salary cap situation, and they can’t afford to hand Tavares another $11 million-a-year contract like his current one. But they also can’t insult their captain with a lowball offer. The expected middle ground? Insiders are predicting a 2–3 year extension at around $4–5 million per year, possibly with performance bonuses worked in.This would help the Leafs manage other key priorities like securing rising star Matthew Knies and still leave room to build a deeper, more balanced roster. For Tavares, it’s about taking a bit less for the good of the team, which says a lot about where his priorities are right now.There’s definitely some chatter about Tavares’ age and whether his production will keep up, but shorter-term deals with reasonable salaries are a smart way to protect the team from long-term decline. Negotiations will ramp up soon, and while there’s always a chance things get complicated, right now, the vibe is optimistic.Also read - Paul Maurice fires back at reporter with savage ‘shotgun a beer’ answer about Florida Panthers’ playoff style","John Tavares' contract is up after the 2024–25 season, and he could walk into free agency and score himself a pretty sweet deal.
