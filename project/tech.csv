Exploding Pagers: How Israel’s Mossad convinced Hezbollah to buy its exploding pagers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/how-israels-mossad-convinced-hezbollah-to-buy-its-exploding-pagers/articleshow/113980318.cms,"In a covert operation by Israel's Mossad , Hezbollah was convinced to purchase and distribute pagers to thousands of its operatives. The scheme was designed to infiltrate the group's communication system, ultimately leading to the deaths and injuries of many members.The story began two years ago when Mossad devised a plan to use pagers as a Trojan horse to penetrate Hezbollah's network.The device in question, the AR924 pager , appeared to be an ideal tool for a militia group like Hezbollah. It was rugged, waterproof, and came with an oversized battery capable of lasting months without needing a recharge. The pagers were marketed as being immune to Israeli tracking, which appealed greatly to Hezbollah’s leaders, who were always wary of Israeli intelligence monitoring their communications.Follow: Live updates on Israel Hezbollah war In early 2023, Hezbollah made a bulk purchase of these pagers, convinced of their reliability. The devices were distributed to mid-level fighters and support personnel across Lebanon and Syria . What Hezbollah didn’t realise was that Mossad had designed the pagers themselves. Hidden within the battery pack of each device was a powerful explosive, which could be triggered remotely by Mossad or activated through a two-step process. The latter option involved pressing two buttons to decrypt messages, meaning the user would likely be holding the device with both hands when it detonated.On September 17, thousands of these pagers exploded simultaneously, killing or maiming an estimated 3,000 Hezbollah officers, fighters, and civilians. The operation is considered one of the most audacious and effective pieces of spycraft in recent history.Read more: How Israel's Mossad turned everyday pagers into deadly weapons against Hezbollah The plan originated in 2022 when Mossad, tasked with combating foreign threats to Israel, sought new ways to infiltrate Hezbollah, which had grown increasingly sophisticated in its communications.The organisation was desperate to avoid Israeli surveillance, and Mossad capitalised on this paranoia by offering Hezbollah what seemed to be secure, untraceable communication devices.To ensure the plan’s success, Mossad had to conceal the origins of the pagers. The devices were branded as Taiwanese and sold through a marketing official who had no knowledge of the true intent behind the sales. Hezbollah had been successfully misled into buying and distributing what were essentially bombs designed by their enemy.The first part of Mossad's pager plot was triggered on September 17. Explosions occurred simultaneously across Lebanon and Syria as Hezbollah operatives attempted to access encrypted messages. The two-step decryption process, which required both hands, ensured maximum casualties as fighters were directly exposed to the blasts. A day later, Mossad remotely triggered walkie-talkies that had been similarly booby-trapped, further adding to the chaos.This operation resulted in devastating consequences for Hezbollah, severely damaging its leadership and disrupting its communication networks. Israel followed up with airstrikes on Hezbollah’s key military infrastructure, intensifying the group's vulnerability. Despite the success of this operation, it also led to heightened tensions in the region, with Hezbollah and its backers, including Iran, retaliating and threatening further escalation.The attack is seen as a turning point in Israel’s ongoing conflict with Hezbollah, demonstrating the lengths Mossad is willing to go to neutralise threats and highlighting the profound risks of modern spycraft.","Israel's Mossad devised a plan to use pagers as a Trojan horse to penetrate Hezbollah's network. Hezbollah was convinced to purchase and distribute pagers to thousands of its operatives. The scheme was designed to infiltrate the group's communication system. Hidden within the battery pack of each device was a powerful explosive, which could be triggered remotely by Mossad.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113980346,imgsize-367375,width-400,resizemode-4/113980346.jpg"

She promptly relocated it back onto her property and disposed of it.However, three weeks later, she was startled by another visit from an enforcement officer who presented her with a £500 (Rs 55,571.20) fine for fly-tipping.""I got a knock on the door with a man with an enforcement camera on his chest, telling me he is filming me,"" she said.

Princess Diana 's ballet teacher, Anne Allan, has written a book ' Dancing with Diana ', where she explains an early sign of the doomed marriage that she noticed in an incident- among many other recollections. In December 1985, Diana danced to Billy Joel's ""Uptown Girl"" at the Royal Opera House in London. It was meant to be a surprise for Charles, but it became a shock to him, as Charles, according to the writer, did not approve of the princess dancing in a slinky gown without stockings.""She wanted Charles to approve of it,"" Anne told Fox News. Charles' three-word reaction was ""well done, darling."" That was it. He immediately went on to do something else. ""And when you've come offstage and your adrenaline is pumping … you just want somebody to tell you that you're doing all right.""The episode is not unknown. The Season 4 of the Crown on Netflix showed the dance routine and its aftermath.Anne Allan explained that there might be two reasons for Charles' displeasure. One, he's probably not a man who likes surprises; and two, probably he did not like his wife wearing a slinky dress, showing her body. "" I’m not quite sure whether he thought it was the appropriate thing for Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales.""But all that Diana was hoping was to light spark in their marriage.""She just wanted to bring romance into her life, because that’s what she thought it should be. And I know that they had many, many happy times together. . . . She would arrange a nice night . . . and Charles occasionally would do that, too. But he was probably a bit more pragmatic as a person.""""I think she was much more able to see possibility of how romance should be. I’m not sure if that was how Charles was. She loved holding hands, she loved having a cuddle. She was a very affectionate person. It meant a lot to her to have that in her life.""The performance was kept under the wrap till the last moment.""She just thought it would be great fun not telling Charles,"" said Allan. ""She would just appear, and it would be hugely entertaining, and everybody would maybe have a nice time.""""More than anything, she wanted to support her husband,"" said Allan. ""That’s what mattered to her. She loved him dearly, and she just wanted him to shine. . . . When articles became more and more about her, she just said, ‘I do wish they would spend more time photographing Charles than I. I don’t want to make things difficult.’""Princess Diana and Anne eventually developed a friendship, and Diana would frequently seek Anne's counsel. In the book, Diana is quoted expressing her distress over her husband’s affair, saying, ""I know he's seeing Camilla again. Why doesn't he love me? I just can't understand.""""I have tried everything, tried to conform to his wishes even though I don’t always agree. There’s no affection between us, and I am always on my own. I just want to be loved. I can’t keep going on like this. They are really expecting me to just say nothing and keep going. How do I do that?""""Anne, he runs off to Camilla whenever he can. It’s not at all what I want. I’d like the marriage to work, but it just isn’t for now. Do I just put up with it, hoping he will change?""","Princess Diana's ballet teacher, Anne Allan, has written a book'Dancing with Diana ', where she explains an early sign of the doomed marriage.

Nate Bargatze: SNL's Nate Bargatze delivers hilarious sequel of 'Washington’s Dream' skit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-did-it-again-snls-nate-bargatze-delivers-hilarious-sequel-of-washingtons-dream-skit/articleshow/114001965.cms,"Washington's Dream 2 - SNL

Saturday Night Live ( SNL ) thrilled audiences once again with the return of the much-loved ""Washington’s Dream"" sketch, starring Nate Bargatze . Fans hailed this second installment as a comedic masterpiece, after the original was dubbed the ""best skit in years"" last season. Bargatze reprised his role as George Washington, delivering absurd and hilarious dreams for the future of the United States, much to the amusement of viewers.The skit, featuring SNL veterans Kenan Thompson, Mikey Day, Bowen Yang, and James Austin Johnson, parodied the oddities of the American-English language and cultural quirks.Washington's bold statement, “We will live through the battle ahead because we fight to control our own destiny... and to do our own thing with the English language,” set the tone for a series of witty exchanges about language, measurements, and food.One of the standout moments in the skit sees Bargatze’s Washington making grand declarations about the language, explaining that their newly-formed nation will have a unique term for the number 12: “We shall call it a dozen.” When Yang’s character asks if there will be other numbers with special names, Washington replies, “None. Only 12 shall have its own word because we are free men, and we will be free to spell some words two different ways,” adding that “donut” will be one of those words, referencing the Americanised spelling.The humour only escalated as Washington shared his dream of renaming animals once they become food. He declares, “Cows will be beef, pigs will be pork,” much to the confusion of his men. However, when Yang asks, “And chickens, sir?” Washington calmly replies, “That one stays. Chickens are chicken.” This deadpan delivery continued to drive the comedy, highlighting the absurd logic behind everyday language choices in America.The skit also delved into the chaos of the American measurement system, with Washington explaining that while liquids like soda, wine, and alcohol would be measured in litres and millilitres, milk and paint would follow a completely different system: gallons, pints, and quarts. When one soldier asks, “How many litres are in a gallon, sir?” Washington simply answers, “Nobody knows,” a moment that mirrors the confusion many have about the imperial system.Adding to the comedic confusion, Washington explains that their nation will adopt the Fahrenheit scale for temperature, proudly stating it will be ""super random"" compared to the rest of the world. The joke continued when he introduced the concept of football, explaining that, despite the name, it’s a game where you mostly use your hands—but you also kick sometimes, earning different points depending on the situation. Bargatze’s Washington never falters, delivering lines with conviction, further enhancing the absurdity of American customs.The sketch then takes a sharp and comedic turn when Thompson’s character, a man of colour, subtly raises the issue of slavery, asking, ""What plans are there for men of colour such as I?"" In typical SNL fashion, Washington sidesteps the question entirely, choosing instead to outline how distance will be measured in inches, feet, and yards, leaving viewers both laughing and reflecting on the historical context.","""Washington's Dream 2"" is the second installment of the much-loved sketch. The original was dubbed the ""best skit in years"" last season. Nate Bargatze reprised his role as George Washington.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.
