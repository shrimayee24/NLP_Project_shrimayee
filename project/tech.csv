The visitors remained stuck for over one and a half hours until rescue teams arrived at the site.The incident occurred near Munnar where a crane-operated dining platform, part of an adventure tourism initiative, had been offering visitors an aerial dining experience. The system, introduced only a few months ago, allows up to 16 people to be seated at a time, lifting them high above the valley for about half an hour while they dine with panoramic views.According to local reports the platform could not be lowered due to a mechanical fault believed to be related to the crane’s fuse.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff has declared that he will not use ChatGPT, the AI chatbot developed by Microsoft-backed AI company OpenAI . His comments came after he used Google’s latest AI model, Gemini 3.0, stating that a two-hour experience with Google’s new model has convinced him to switch permanently. Google CEO Sundar Pichai termed the Gemini 3 as the company’s “most intelligent model, that combines all of Gemini’s capabilities together so you can bring any idea to life. ”In a post on X, Benioff claimed that Gemini 3.0 has brought a monumental shift in the AI landscape. The CEO specifically praised Gemini 3’s performance across multiple modalities, noting key improvements in reasoning, speed, image quality, and video processing as the compelling factors behind his decision.“Holy shit. I’ve used ChatGPT every day for 3 years. Just spent 2 hours on Gemini 3. I’m not going back. The leap is insane — reasoning, speed, images, video… everything is sharper and faster. It feels like the world just changed, again. ❤️ 🤖”Benioff’s endorsement highlights the competitive pressure now facing OpenAI as models from rival tech giants like Google make significant advances. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and even OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman praised Pichai following the launch of Gemini 3.The xAI founder said “Congrats” on Pichai’s ""Geminiii"" announcement on X, and “Nice Work” to Demis Hassabis, the chief of DeepMind. Altman posted “Congrats to Google on Gemini 3! Looks like a great model.”Altman even noted potential “temporary economic headwinds” in an internal memo but expressed confidence in OpenAl’s rapid progress and leadership in the Al race.“We have built enough strength as a company to weather great models shipping elsewhere competition... (so), having most of our research team focused on really getting to superintelligence is critically important,” Altman wrote in the internal memo.Stripe CEO Patrick Collison also posted on X that Gemini 3 built him an “interactive web page summarising 10 breakthroughs in genetics,” and called it “pretty cool.”Nvidia also responded to Google's stock rally, with a company stating 'We're delighted by Google's success—they've made great advances in AI, and we continue to supply them.' However, this diplomatic response came amid reports that Google's AI chips (TPUs) could potentially challenge Nvidia's market dominance, particularly after news emerged that Meta was in talks to purchase billions of dollars worth of Google's tensor processing units. Despite Google's stock hitting all-time highs and rising over 120% since April, while Nvidia's shares dipped following the competitive news, Nvidia emphasized its leadership position, noting it remains 'a generation ahead of the industry.'","Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff has declared that he will not use ChatGPT, the AI chatbot developed by Microsoft-backed AI company OpenAI.

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Disruption will come from the unexpected





Take lessons from the dot-com era









Billionaire investor and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban has now issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and Meta. Cuban has argued that all these companies are overspending in the race to build the world’s most powerful AI model. As reported by Business Insider, speaking in the Pioneers of AI podcast, Cuban compared today’s AI arms race to the search engine boom of 1990s. The search engine boom ultimately ended with Google dominating the market and leaving all the rivals behind.“You’ve got five, six, whatever it is, companies that are trying to create the ultimate foundational model that we all depend on,” Cuban said. “It’s almost like in the ’90s when all the search engines were competing pre-Google… Now, we know with search engines it’s Google, and then there’s Bing, as, like, 1 or 2% and DuckDuckGo has got a half a percent. So it’s effectively a winner-take-all.”Like many other world leaders and analysts, Cuban has also cautioned that the massive investments done on AI could ultimately lead to the creation of a bubble. “They may be overspending,” he said.“And if they overspend or get too caught up, the bubble is in the competition between all those models because that could pop just like that with any new technology.”Along with this, he also raised concerns about the infrastructure costs behind AI, majorly the massive and expensive data centers which are being built to power large models. “I just can’t imagine over a 10-year period that we aren’t going to improve the technology enough that if you overspend on today’s technology, it just doesn’t feel right to me,” Cuban added.Cuban also emphasised that the disruption AI will not come from incremental improvements but from something “incredible” that no one sees coming. “Somebody’s going to come up with some incredible shit, right? If I knew what it was, I’d do it,” he said, suggesting that the current race may be blindsided by a breakthrough outside the existing competition.Cuban said he recognizes the same mix of hype, excitement, and overspending now playing out in AI. “They anticipate for at least another decade spending every penny they have,” he said of the major model developers. “I mean, if that’s not ripe for disruption to come up with better ways, I don’t know what is.”","Billionaire investor and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban has issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and Meta.

Reducing dependence on Taiwan-based TSMC







Five years after Apple famously broke up with Intel to design its own revolutionary M-series chips, the tech giant may be rekindling the relationship—but this time, with a twist. Supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reports Intel could start manufacturing Apple's M-series processors by 2027, though Apple would retain full control over chip design while Intel handles production.The chipmaker could begin producing Apple's lowest-end M-series processors using its 18AP advanced manufacturing process as early as the second or third quarter of 2027, Kuo revealed in a post on X (formerly Twitter). The Intel-made Apple Silicon would likely power the upcoming MacBook Air, iPad Air, and iPad Pro models, with expected production volumes between 15-20 million units.Unlike the previous relationship where Intel designed x86-based processors for Macs, this partnership would see Intel solely manufacturing Apple-designed ARM-based chips. Taiwan-based TSMC would continue supplying the majority of Apple's chips, including higher-end variants and iPhone processors.The deal could help Apple demonstrate its commitment to buying American by incorporating more US-based companies into its supply chain, Kuo theorised. Bloomberg reported in September that Intel approached Apple about securing an investment as part of its turnaround efforts, with Apple CEO Tim Cook previously telling CNBC the company would ""love to see Intel come back"".The US government acquired approximately 10% of Intel in an August deal brokered by the Trump administration, positioning the chipmaker as critical to domestic semiconductor production.While TSMC remains Apple's primary chip supplier, diversifying manufacturing sources addresses supply chain management requirements, according to Kuo. This strategic move would provide Apple with a backup option for its entry-level processors.Apple has already signed a non-disclosure agreement with Intel and obtained preliminary design specifications, with key development milestones tracking as expected. The company awaits Intel's updated design kit scheduled for the first quarter of 2026.For Intel, landing Apple as a foundry client would validate its turnaround efforts and potentially attract other premium customers. For Apple, it's calculated risk management wrapped in political optics—keeping options open while maintaining technological leadership.","Intel could start manufacturing Apple's M-series processors by 2027.

Q: How often should I review and update my career cushioning efforts?

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

"Ekman, who linked facial expressions to emotions, dies at 91",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/ekman-who-linked-facial-expressions-to-emotions-dies-at-91/articleshow/125649854.cms,"



Paul Ekman, a psychologist who linked thousands of facial expressions to the emotions they often subconsciously conveyed, and who used his research to advise FBI interrogators and screeners for the Transportation Security Administration as well as Hollywood animators, died Nov 17 at his home in San Francisco. He was 91.Ekman sought to add scientific exactitude to the human impulse to interpret how others feel through their facial expressions. He recorded 18 types of smiles, for example, distinguishing between a forced smile and a spontaneous one; a genuine smile, he discovered, crinkles the orbicularis oculi muscle - that is, it creates crow's feet around the eyes.Sometimes described as the world's most famous face reader, Ekman was influential in reshaping the way facial expressions were understood - as the product of evolution rather than environment - and his findings crossed over to popular culture.As a young researcher in the late 1960s, Ekman changed the scientific consensus on facial expressions. In the postwar era, the conventional wisdom of eminent anthropologists like Margaret Mead was that human facial expressions were learned and that they varied across cultures. Ekman believed otherwise. He showed photographs of people making faces expressing 30 different emotions - including anger, joy and fear - to subjects in the United States, Japan and South America.Across cultures, the study's participants linked the expressions they were shown with the same emotions.He then travelled to Papua New Guinea with a colleague, Wallace V Friesen, and showed the same pictures to some 300 Indigenous people who had no exposure to modern media and could not have learned to interpret faces that way. These subjects also connected the expressions to the same emotions.""There is a pan-cultural element in facial expressions of emotion,"" Ekman wrote in a paper in 1970 on returning to the United States.","Paul Ekman, a psychologist who linked thousands of facial expressions to the emotions they often subconsciously conveyed, died Nov 17 at his home in San Francisco.

Driving in the UAE comes with responsibilities, and the Black Points System is at the heart of keeping roads safe for everyone. Introduced to curb reckless driving and reduce accidents, it assigns points to your license for traffic violations. Accumulating these points can lead to hefty fines, vehicle impoundment, or even license suspension. For both residents and visitors, understanding how black points work, which violations carry them, and how to check your status is essential. Staying informed can help you avoid penalties and ensure a smoother, safer driving experience across all emirates.Black points are penalties assigned to a driver’s license for traffic violations. Introduced in July 2017 under Ministerial Resolution No. 178/2017, the system applies across all UAE emirates, including Dubai and Abu Dhabi.Violations are recorded using an advanced network of cameras, radars, and AI-powered monitoring systems. Once a violation is detected and confirmed, drivers typically receive an SMS notification within 48 hours detailing the offense, the fine, and the number of black points added.The system is designed not only to penalize drivers financially but also to track repeat offenses, which can ultimately lead to license suspension or mandatory retraining. It ensures safer roads and consistently encourages responsible driving behavior, moreover supporting long-term compliance.The UAE uses a 24 point scale to manage driving penalties:License suspension periods are based on how many times the 24 point limit is reached:Drivers can monitor their black points in several ways:In addition to black points, violations can also result in hefty fines, vehicle impoundment, and a daily impoundment fee of Dh100.The UAE enforces 143 federal traffic laws, each with penalties to maintain road discipline. Some of the most common violations include:These penalties are carefully designed to encourage responsible driving and protect all road users.Checking your black points is simple and can help you avoid penalties:Regular monitoring ensures you are aware of your points and prevents unexpected license suspensions or retraining requirements.By following these practices, drivers can stay safe, avoid fines, and prevent their license from being suspended.","Black points are penalties assigned to a driver’s license for traffic violations.

A video showcasing the unexpected beauty of Japan’s gutter has gone viral on social media, drawing widespread attention for its surprising clarity and vibrant aquatic life.Shared by UK travel blogger Alicia Cooper, the clip captures fish swimming in crystal-clear water inside a gutter on Koi no Oyogu Machi Street in Shimabara, a city on Japan’s Kyushu island.In the video, Cooper dips her camera into the drainage canal, revealing colorful fishes gliding gracefully. A text overlay on the clip reads: “POV: you stick your camera in a gutter in Japan.”Cooper clarified in the video that the gutter is not part of the city’s sewage system, but a drainage canal fed by natural spring water. She added that the koi fish were introduced in the 1970s to attract tourists.The video, posted on Monday, has already garnered over 4 lakh likes. Cooper also cautioned viewers: “They don’t look like this in England. So, please don’t visit Japan expecting them all to look like this!”The post has sparked reactions from social media users. One commented: “Even the rivers of India are not this much clean as the gutters of Japan are.” Another wrote: “We can never worry about falling and getting dirty later in Japan.”A netizen reacted to the video and quipped, “Phir Nobita kis gutter mein girta tha?” (In which drain did Nobita fall?) — referring to the character from Doraemon.Cooper also shared a tip for viewers interested in seeing the site themselves, highlighting that Shimabara’s canals are fed by natural springs and hundreds of koi have been released along some of these waterways for tourists.","Video shows fish swimming in crystal-clear water inside a gutter in Shimabara, Japan.

Dubai’s VIP dining showdown

The Ultra-Elite Table: At high-end spots like Günaydin in Souk Al Bahar, the most exclusive premium tables (think two tables total) can hit a staggering Dh12,000 per person. This typically includes a set menu and premium beverages.

Premium Dining: Other high-view venues like The Meat Co charge a minimum spend of Dh5,000 for a lower terrace seat.

Fast Food, High Price: Even the casual spots get in on the action! You can expect to pay around Dh2,200 per person for a ""gold table"" (outdoor view) at places like Five Guys (unlimited burgers and shakes included!). Other casual dining outdoor spots like TGI Fridays start around Dh3,000.

The Small Catch: When booking a restaurant package, remember a critical detail: most restaurants on The Dubai Mall Promenade and Souk Al Bahar are dry venues, meaning they are unable to serve alcohol. Confirm your beverage package before you book if a celebratory drink is part of your NYE plan.

Looking ahead





Dubai doesn't just ring in the New Year; it throws a party so massive the entire world watches. The Burj Khalifa spectacular is a perfect mix of pyrotechnics, laser choreography, and dazzling multi-sensory effects. If you're looking to score the best view, you need a strategy, and a budget.The good news? The celebration has been supersized this year into an eight-day mega extravaganza, turning Downtown Dubai into the planet’s biggest open-air stage. Here is your definitive, step-by-step guide on how to be part of the show, from the hardcore free viewer to the ultra-luxury diner.Want a guaranteed, great view without sacrificing your entire day to sidewalk sitting? Emaar offers a brilliant middle-ground solution with its official ticketed event at Burj Park. Your ticket guarantees you a prime spot with an unobstructed sightline of the massive spectacle, no towering strangers or accidental trees in your frame.This year, the park is hosting a special Bollywood-themed experience in collaboration with Shah Rukh Khan’s Frontstage, promising blockbuster energy, live performances, and a festival atmosphere. The venue includes access to dedicated live entertainment, kids’ workshops, and a variety of food and beverage trucks and stalls to keep you fueled (Note: Food and drinks are purchased separately).You must collect your access badge between December 26 and 30. No badge, no entry on December 31.

Dedicated spectators often arrive up to 12 hours before midnight to stake their claim.Downtown Dubai becomes highly congested on New Year's Eve. Roads around the area, including the Dubai Mall, typically start closing as early as 4:00 PM, making arrival and departure a serious planning exercise.For those a bit further back, or stuck in the inevitable crowd, large LED screens will be set up along Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Boulevard, streaming the live entertainment and the countdown show in real-time.Whether you’re setting your alarm for a dawn arrival to claim your free spot, securing the smart ticket to the spectacular Burj Park party, or clinking glasses at a dazzling Dh12,000 VIP table, the Burj Khalifa guarantees one of the world's most unforgettable welcomes to the New Year.The choice comes down to time versus budget, but the payoff remains the same: an explosion of awe, an unforgettable countdown, and a spectacular memory to start the year.

A Safety Net with a Ladder: Unlike old welfare systems, this new structure focuses on rehabilitation, training, and employment. The system categorizes beneficiaries and implements empowerment plans to help those able to work transition from reliance on aid to becoming productive contributors to the economy.

Key Timeline: The modern, enhanced program was introduced in 2022, marking a significant upgrade from the previous system.

Check carefully: Re-enter credentials and ensure you selected the correct programme page (الضمان الاجتماعي).

The Developed Social Security System (الضمان الاجتماعي المطور), known locally as ""Dhaman Al Ijtima'i Al Mutawwar,"" is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's core financial safety net. Overseen by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development (HRSD), this comprehensive program goes beyond simple aid by focusing on both immediate financial support and long-term empowerment.It aims to achieve the goals of Vision 2030 by ensuring that cash support reaches the most vulnerable while simultaneously transitioning recipients toward financial independence.“Ahlīyatuk” refers to the eligibility result for the developed Social Security (الضمان الاجتماعي المطوّر) program administered by Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development (HRSD). The eligibility check tells applicants whether their support request was approved for the current cycle or if further documentation is needed. This is the single monthly status beneficiaries watch to know if they will receive that month’s cash disbursement. The primary goal of the Developed Social Security program is to alleviate poverty and guarantee that eligible families and individuals secure a minimum monthly income for basic needs.Follow these exact steps to see your eligibility quickly:If the eligibility page or button does not appear, it usually means your application has not yet been processed, the Ministry says eligibility reviews are completed before the 9th of each Gregorian month.Applicants should wait until that window closes before checking again.HRSD has a fixed disbursement routine: approved beneficiaries generally receive their social security payment on the 1st day of each Gregorian month. For example, the news guidance confirms the December 2025 payment is scheduled for 1 December 2025; rumors of early payouts are false, the Ministry has said. Use the HRSD payments page to confirm the deposit date and transaction details.A clear, fast eligibility check reduces anxiety for applicants and cuts the spread of false claims about early payments or changed dates.

“Fuentes is a Qatari-backed spy-op sent to split the movement — wake up!”

“Shouldn’t you be focusing on England instead of picking fights online?”

“He’s part of the very system he claims to fight against.”

Tucker Carlson, Nick Fuentes & Trump: Inside the Chain Reaction Splitting Republicans Wide Open





Conservative commentator Tucker Carlson challenged Piers Morgan to say a gay slur on camera while discussing free speech in the United Kingdom.During Wednesday’s episode of The Tucker Carlson Show, the topic arose after Carlson referenced a story from The Daily Mail about Elizabeth Kinney, a 34-year-old woman who was convicted of a hate crime for using the slur against her attacker in text messages. She was fined and sentenced to a 12-month community order.Arguing that “you’re allowed to be homophobic if you want in a free country,” Carlson asked Morgan directly: “Would you say the word on camera?”Morgan, who said he hadn’t heard the story before, replied, “No.”Carlson pressed: “Why? You don’t want to get arrested, do you?” He added provocatively, “Ohhh, because it’s so harmful to people? Is it like gay-bashing? What’s wrong with that?”Morgan said you don’t need to use derogatory language about the LGBTQ community to make a point about women’s rights.Carlson used the word several times saying, “I’m using it because you’re not allowed to because you’re …”“I am allowed to, I just choose not to,” Morgan replied.Carlson defended himself, saying he is not anti-gay and “never has been,” adding: “I can use any word I want. How about this? Let my life, the way that I actually live and treat people, be the testament to my heart. That’s how I feel. And if I’ve mistreated someone, that is a sin.”Morgan interrupted, suggesting Carlson wouldn’t use the word directly to a gay person’s face. Carlson responded: “Not in a mean way. Just like the only people who say the ‘N-word’ are Black. Period.”He added that during his time in TV news, he had been around many gay people who used the word themselves.Carlson, who was fired from Fox News in April 2023, has a history of controversial remarks and conspiracy theories.He previously claimed in his biography, Tucker, by Chadwick Moore, that “being racist is not a crime,” though he acknowledged it might be a moral crime.","Conservative commentator Tucker Carlson challenged Piers Morgan to say a gay slur on camera while discussing free speech in the United Kingdom.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

CTO Brian Atwell suggests intelligence tests, like IQ tests, could aid early screening for PM candidates. He emphasizes rigorous hiring processes, noting that easily practiced interviews fail to build strong teams. Designing effective, ungameable interviews requires significant dedication.

Why CloudKitchens' CTO thinks IQ tests are essential for hiring project managers

""It probably wouldn't hurt if you slapped an IQ test in front of the PM in your process,”

""It wouldn't help differentiate between the excellent and super excellent, but it would help weed out people very early, and then you could spend more time differentiating between the good versus excellent and the rest of your process,""

“Like an interview that tests your ability to recall things, your experience, or just your mindsets, does not build a strong engineering team.

An interview that anyone can pass, regardless of IQ, if they can practice enough, that does not build a strong engineering team.”

“The reason that companies don't do it is that it just takes a ton of work to build a good process. Like in a tech org, you have dozens of different roles, and each one needs different interviews, so the leadership team needs to be really, really dedicated to it,”





CloudKitchens, the $15 billion ghost kitchen startup founded by Uber cofounder Travis Kalanick , finds that hiring project managers (PMs) is more challenging than hiring software engineers. According to CloudKitchens CTO Brian Atwell, the difficulty stems from the nature of the job itself.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai celebrates new breakthrough in quantum algorithm; Elon Musk replies: ‘Looks like…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-celebrates-new-breakthrough-in-quantum-algorithm-elon-musk-replies-looks-like/articleshow/124754841.cms,"



What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”
