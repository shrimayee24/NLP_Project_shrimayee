Northern Ireland is ready to embrace autumn as the clocks will change next weekend, marking the end of British Summer Time . At 02:00 BST on 27 October, clocks will move back one hour, allowing people an extra hour of sleep.The change marks the beginning of shorter days and longer nights , leading up to winter solstice on 21 December, which is the shortest day of the year.This practice of changing clocks has been followed for over a century to make better use of daylight during the winter months. Shifting an hour of sunlight to the morning aims to provide brighter mornings during the darker season. However, even though people gain an extra hour of sleep, this change can disrupt sleep patterns .Autumn weather is already evident across Northern Ireland, with cooler temperatures ranging between 10°C and 14°C and frequent rain showers. October often brings more cloudy skies, frosty mornings, and occasional storms from the Atlantic.The clock change will make mornings slightly brighter, but sunsets will be earlier, making evenings feel longer.This transition period advises people to prepare for the colder months ahead.(This is a top story on Google Trends)","Clocks will move back one hour on 27 October, marking the end of British Summer Time.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Auto cos bet on 'premium' showrooms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/auto-cos-bet-on-premium-showrooms/articleshow/115100271.cms,"NEW DELHI: To tap into the growing love of Indians for luxury products and experiences, auto companies are setting up all-new exclusive retail formats. All this even when the mainstream car market remains cautious, and generally sluggish even as demand picked up during the festive period.The premiumisation drive is being rolled out right from the mass players such as Maruti and Tata Motors, to mid-scale brands such as Hyundai and JSW MG Motor, and even luxury companies such as Mercedes-Benz that has created a separate, curated experience for its AMG line of super cars.Two-wheeler maker Hero Moto has gone in for a special 'premia' range for its powerful bikes and also for those that are developed along with partner Harley-Davidson. On the other hand, Royal Enfield has also enhanced experience at its outlets, which are now positioned more as ""lifestyle destinations"" with a separate line of accessories and merchandise, which include high-quality biking gear and clothing.Toyota has also opened separate 'guest experience centres' (GECs) for retailing its luxury brand Lexus. The GECs have come up across select cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru and Mumbai.Hyundai has been working on a similar strategy for its soon-to-launch luxury brand Genesis.But why would a luxury player require a more sophisticated retail experience? Santosh Iyer, MD & CEO of Mercedes India, says that the company wants to offer ""immersive brand experiences"" through specialised trained personnel who provide individual consultations.While Maruti was among the first to set up Nexa outlets for its 'premium' set of cars, others are joining the bandwagon now. JSW MG Motors is setting up 'MG Select', which will house its 'accessible luxury' cars.","The premiumisation drive is being rolled out right from the mass players such as Maruti and Tata Motors.

Describing her as “a breath of fresh air,” Murthy shared his admiration for her intelligence, kindness, and dedication to social causes. Now married for 47 years, the couple has become one of India’s most respected duos, with Sudha Murty achieving acclaim as an author, Rajya Sabha member, and philanthropist.When Kapil Sharma humorously questioned whether their habits have grown similar over the years, Sudha Murty responded with her characteristic humor and honesty. “I became a workaholic like him and a stickler for time,” she shared, adding, “I cook so badly, but he never complains. Look at Murthy saab's weight — that's thanks to my cooking!” The playful exchange between the Murthys highlighted their mutual respect and understanding, as well as Sudha’s humility and humor about her culinary skills.The episode also introduces Deepinder Goyal, co-founder of Zomato, and his wife, Grecia Munoz, who he married earlier this year.

During the show, Goyal shared an amusing story about how he and Grecia surprised Zomato customers by delivering orders themselves in Gurgaon.

Last year, she joined The Kapil Sharma Show alongside filmmaker Guneet Monga and actress Raveena Tandon, where she shared personal anecdotes about her life and experiences. The audience was captivated by her wisdom and humility, as she recounted stories from her travels, including a memorable instance at an airport where she was labeled “cattle class” for wearing traditional attire. Sudha used humor to narrate her response, underscoring her pride in her cultural roots and her unshakeable confidence.In addition to her philanthropic and literary contributions, Sudha Murty’s previous appearance also revealed her admiration for Bollywood legends such as Shah Rukh Khan and Dilip Kumar, bridging the worlds of Indian cinema and literature.The teaser release has already stirred excitement among fans, who are eager to see the contrasting yet complementary dynamics of these two couples.

Google’s experimental AI assistant, codenamed ""Jarvis,"" has been reportedly leaked to the public through the Chrome Web Store. According to a report by The Information, the Chrome Web Store page for Jarvis describes it as a ""helpful companion that surfs the web for you."" The prototype was briefly available on the Chrome Web Store before being taken down by the company. While the leaked version was not fully functional, its description hinted at advanced capabilities like web browsing and task automation.Google is planning to reveal Jarvis in December. The AI assistant is expected to compete with rivals like Anthropic's Claude, which can perform complex tasks such as typing text and controlling a computer's cursor. While Google has not officially announced Jarvis, its accidental appearance on the Chrome Web Store offers a glimpse into the company's ongoing AI development efforts. It remains to be seen when or if Jarvis will be officially released to the public.This AI prototype goes beyond basic tasks like setting reminders or checking the weather, offering more advanced capabilities like browsing the web and completing tasks such as buying groceries, booking flights, and conducting research. This suggests a more sophisticated level of AI assistance than what is currently available in mainstream virtual assistants.Jarvis is designed to streamline web-based tasks by integrating with the Chrome browser. It can analyse web pages, interpret user instructions, and perform actions like clicking buttons and typing text, though its speed is currently being optimised.Jarvis joins a growing field of AI-powered automation tools being developed by tech giants like Microsoft (Copilot Vision), Apple (Apple Intelligence), Anthropic (Claude), and OpenAI (ChatGPT). These tools aim to simplify digital tasks and enhance productivity through natural language interaction and automated actions.While Jarvis shows promise in its ability to automate web-based tasks, its final form and public availability remain uncertain. As AI technology advances, we can expect more sophisticated tools that will transform our digital interactions and workflows.","Google's experimental AI assistant, codenamed ""Jarvis,"" has been leaked to the public.

What Bengaluru police said about this app



“We want to integrate the Public Eye and other services into a single app. Even the traffic police will start using the app with added features to report road incidents. They (the agency) will make a digital map of the city that we can use to simulate projects such as road closures or changing one-ways without inconveniencing people. If the simulation shows better results, we want to implement those changes.”

“All work orders will be finalised by the end of this month and works will be completed by January,”

Bengaluru commuters may soon have a ""one-stop"" solution for all traffic updates. The Bengaluru Traffic Police is reportedly planning to launch the ASTraM (Actionable Intelligence for Sustainable Traffic Management) super-app within the next two months. This app will provide real-time traffic congestion updates and will even allow users to report accidents.The app aims to eliminate the need for relying on multiple navigation apps or social media for traffic information. According to a report by Deccan Herald, users will be able to report violations and accidents on this app by submitting images without revealing their personal information.However, this new app will be different from the existing ASTraM app, which is exclusively for traffic police to monitor and analyse traffic patterns. The upcoming public version is expected to cover the entire city, expanding from the current simulation model that covers 21 major traffic corridors.In a statement to Deccan Herald, the Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic) M N Anucheth said the new ""one-stop"" super-app will offer several useful features for commuters, including real-time traffic congestion alerts within a 5-kilometre radius, the ability to report accidents and a convenient way to view and pay traffic fines.JCP Anucheth said:The traffic police will also hire eligible agencies to create microsimulation models of the city within the next three months. This will enable them to model individual vehicle movement to assess the traffic, down to a street level, to manage it better.The Bengaluru Traffic Police's super-app is part of a broader initiative to improve traffic management in the city. This initiative includes various projects, such as procuring new signboards, solar blinkers, body-worn cameras, and cat's eyes to enhance road safety. Tenders for these projects were released in October, and work is currently underway, JCP Anucheth noted.he added.",Bengaluru Traffic Police is reportedly planning to launch the ASTraM super-app within the next two months.

Paint gets a generative AI boost

Notepad gets AI for rewriting

Microsoft is bringing artificial intelligence (AI) prowess to nearly 40-year-old products: Paint and Notepad. The company has announced new AI experiences for Paint and Notepad to Windows Insiders in the Canary and Dev Channels on Windows 11, aimed at enhancing creativity and productivity.Paint is receiving two major AI-powered additions: Generative Fill and Generative EraseGenerative Fill will allow users to add or modify elements within an image simply by describing what they want using text prompts. By selecting an area and providing a description, users can generate new content that blends with the existing image style.For example, users can ask the AI to make a mediaeval castle in the selected area of Windows XP wallpaper, and it will create one. This feature is initially available on Snapdragon-powered Copilot+ PCs.Generative Erase will enable users to remove unwanted objects from an image. By selecting the object to be erased, the AI intelligently fills in the surrounding area, making it look like the object was never there. This feature is available to all Windows 11 users.In addition to these new features, Microsoft is also improving the performance and expanding the availability of existing AI capabilities in Paint, such as Cocreator and Image Creator.Notepad, the simple text editor, is also getting a significant AI upgrade. The Rewrite feature will allow users to rephrase sentences, adjust the tone and even modify the length of their text using AI. By selecting the text they want to rewrite, users can generate multiple variations and choose the one that best suits their needs. This feature is available in preview to all Windows 11 users in select regions.“We have also continued to improve Notepad launch performance. With this update, most users will see app launch time improve by more than 35%, with some users seeing improvements of 55% or more,” the company said.","Paint is receiving two major AI-powered additions: Generative Fill and Generative Erase.

Roblox , the popular online gaming platform that has faced scrutiny over allegations of misleading investors and concerns about children's exposure to inappropriate content, is implementing changes to address these issues.In a post on Roblox developers forum, the company has announced that it is “updating experience guideline policies to keep our younger users safe.” A report by Hindenburg Research in October highlighted the presence of sexually explicit content within the platform, raising concerns about child safety.Roblox has denied the charges.Roblox said that it is bringing two changes on the platform: Unrated experiences non-accessible and restricting access to social hangouts to users under 13.By default, users under the age of 13 will not be able to play, search, and discover unrated experiences. This will ensure that parents and users have more clarity into the types of content available on Roblox and will help them make more informed choices about what they want to play.We will be restricting access to Social Hangouts and Free-form User Creation experiences to users ages 13+.This means that starting December 3, Roblox will require creators to complete a questionnaire for each experience they wish to make available to users under 13. This questionnaire will help ensure that all experiences accessible to young users are age-appropriate and meet Roblox's community standards.As a result of this change, any unrated experiences will be hidden from search results and recommendations for users under 13. These users will still be able to access these experiences via direct link, but they will no longer be easily discoverable.The second big change is restricting social hangouts and free-form user creation for users under 13. Starting November 18, experiences featuring social hangouts and free-form 2D user creation will only be available to users 13 and older.This restriction applies to experiences where the primary purpose is socialising and communicating with other users, such as “vibe games” and virtual clubs.","Roblox is bringing two changes on the platform: Unrated experiences non- accessible and restricting access to social hangouts to users under 13.

WWE seems to have some big plans for the Wyatt Sicks

For months now, The Wyatt Sicks have been one of the most menacing factions in WWE . Consisting of Uncle Howdy, Erick Rowan, Dexter Lumis, Joe Gacy and Nikki Cross have been on an absolute tear lately. Now, months after their in-ring debut and reveal, Bo Dallas has finally shared the inspiration behind the Wyatt Sicks. Let’s take a look at what Bo had to say during his conversation with Chris McPherson from Collider:“Growing up, me and Windham were obsessed with horror movie…One of our biggest influences was the ’90s version of ‘The Stand’ by Stephen King. We both loved that, and it’s funny because when we were coming up with ideas for characters, we both independently decided to draw inspiration from Randall Flagg without even realizing the other was doing it.”Both Bo and Bray had some innovative ideas after watching Stephen King’s The Stand. In fact, the two were so intrigued by it that they each decided to split different parts of Flagg’s mentality and use it to their advantage in their wrestling career. Now that we know the inspiration behind them, let’s take a look at what plans WWE have in mind for the Wyatt Sicks.Also Read: WWE superstar CM Punk welcomes new WWE ID signings On the latest episode of WWE Raw, the fans were completely shocked when they saw that the Wyatt Sicks kidnapped the former WWE Champion, The Miz. However, all the Wyatt Sicks care about is causing pain and have continued to torment Miz ever since they got his hands on him. It’ll be interesting to see whether someone will rise to the occasion and attempt to rescue The Miz, for all we know it could be his estranged friend R-Truth.On the other hand, the Wyatt Sicks could beat The Miz to a pulp before releasing him. So, The Wyatt Sicks will likely have their hands full as we head into this week’s episode of Friday Night SmackDown.

WWE Hall of Famer, Bubba Ray Dudley, has claimed credit for helping WWE NXT defeat AEW Dynamite’s viewership numbers on 11/6. The November 6 episode of NXT saw Bully Ray team up with NXT Champion Trick Williams to take on Ridge Holland and Ethan Page. While Bully Ray and Williams ended up losing the match, they still managed to put up quite an entertaining performance.Thanks to their efforts in the ring, NXT drew in a total of 619,000 viewers with a 0.17 rating in the 18-49 demographic. On the other hand, WWE’s competitors, AEW Dynamite could only manage to draw in a total of 523,000 viewers with a 0.16 rating in the 18-49 demographic. As of right now, NXT is making it look like child’s work when it comes to defeating AEW in viewership.After the 11/6 episode, Bully Ray was quick to take to X where he shared a photo of himself, Trick Williams and D-Von Dudley who also made a shocking appearance.

Things are so bad that even their live events are being held in almost empty arenas.If Tony Khan doesn’t soon figure out a way to put an end to Dynamite’s viewership wars, we might get to see the brand or AEW as a whole disappear into nothingness.
