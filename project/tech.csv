Michael Strahan’s daughter opens up about feeling 'unsupported' by her sister during cancer recovery journey



Isabella Strahan, daughter of NFL legend Michael Strahan, is proving to be a true warrior after overcoming a grueling nine-month battle with brain cancer. Now, as she approaches her one-year cancer-free milestone, Isabella is embracing life with renewed strength alongside her twin sister, Sophia. Her inspiring journey reflects resilience, sisterly bonds, and the power of a positive mindset.On a recent episode of the Battlefront podcast, Isabella Strahan shared an amusing yet surprising revelation about Sophia’s support—or lack thereof—during her recovery. “Kinda just vlogging reflecting back. I would always love to follow it on the TV at home. I don’t think that Sophia has seen any of my vlogs, so yeah, she is like the number one ‘unsupporter’ over here. It’s be like, ‘How could you not have seen a single one’?” Isabella joked. While it’s hard to imagine fighting cancer without full support from a twin, it’s clear that their relationship is built on playful honesty and deep love.After receiving her diagnosis in October 2023, Isabella decided to open up about her health journey through a YouTube vlog channel. Her candid updates not only helped her process the challenges of cancer treatment but also inspired countless followers. Though Sophia may not have watched the vlogs, her real-life support has been unwavering. The twins’ bond is more evident than ever as they face life’s ups and downs together.On March 12th, Isabella took to her Instagram story to share a heartwarming moment with Sophia during a much-needed “sister session.” The Strahan sisters were seen crushing a kettlebell deadlift workout while sporting stylish Alo Yoga gear. Isabella looked fierce in her black gym wear, while Sophia kept it cool in a gray outfit. What stood out most, however, was Isabella’s radiant smile and the sight of her curls growing back beautifully—a visible sign of her recovery. It’s inspiring to see her reclaim her strength after such a tough battle.Fitness has become a central part of Isabella’s post-recovery routine, with Sophia right by her side. Their shared workouts are more than just a way to stay fit—they symbolize the strength and support that have defined Isabella’s comeback. With Sophia as her rock, Isabella is stepping into this new chapter of life with confidence and grace. Her journey from battling cancer to thriving alongside her sister is a powerful testament to resilience, love, and the unbreakable bond between siblings.Also Read: NFL teams make history with unprecedented move ahead of 2025 Draft after 55 years Meanwhile, Sophia Strahan recently shared with PEOPLE magazine how she became a pillar of strength for her twin sister, Isabella, during her battle with brain cancer. Sophia’s goal was to help Isabella feel like a typical young adult, even while undergoing intense treatment.Reflecting on their conversations, Sophia recalled, ""Something she would say to me quite a few times was like, 'I just don't feel normal. I want to feel normal. Nothing about my life right now is normal.'"" Sophia explained, ""I think something that I tried to do best was to make her feel normal."" Her unwavering support and efforts to create a sense of normalcy tells us the powerful bond between the Strahan sisters during Isabella’s challenging journey.","Michael Strahan's daughter opens up about feeling 'unsupported' by her sister during cancer recovery journey.

Is MLB The Show 25 available on Xbox Game Pass?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/news/is-mlb-the-show-25-available-on-xbox-game-pass/articleshow/119168403.cms,"(Image Via - MLBTheShow’s “X” Account)

Will MLB The Show 25 be available on Xbox Game Pass?



What does this move mean for the Xbox Players?



The fans of MLB The Show were quite thrilled when the series made its debut in 2021 on Xbox Game Pass. It allowed the subscribers to play the game without any additional cost. The trend then continued with MLB The Show 22, 23, and 24. But now, as the series is closer to its latest release, the highly anticipated game fans, especially the Xbox Game Pass subscribers, are quite eager to play the game and wish to know how they can access MLB The Show 25 .While there has been no official explanation from MLB or Sony since 2021, it’s the first time that MLB The Show 25 won’t be available on Xbox Game Pass. So, the fans cannot play it, either at launch or during 2025. Breaking the series' 4-year tradition, the news has been confirmed by MLB and Sony that the game will skip the subscription services this year entirely. It will require the players to purchase the game outright. The official statement from MLB The Show 25 developers read, “The game will not be on platform subscription services in 2025.""The shift here likely reflects the evolving licensing strategies. The move has left the fans disappointed, especially those who got accustomed to the game access through the Game Pass Subscription. The previous titles, including MLB The Show 24, will be removed from the Game Pass by late March 2025 too. It signals the clear departure of the series from its early partnership with the Xbox subscription service.For the Xbox users, it means the gamers will have to pay $69.99 full price for the Standard Edition. They can even opt for Digital Deluxe Edition for $79.99. It comes with early access, starting March 14, 2025. The Collector’s Edition is priced at $229.99. It will offer the players additional physical goodies like a steelbook case and exclusive items. But it's a steep investment for most players.MLB The Show 25 absence on Game Pass raises questions about the game’s accessibility, especially for casual players who might not wish to spend $70 on a single game. However, the multi-platform availability of the game ensures that players on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch can still enjoy the latest installment, albeit at the full price.","MLB The Show 25 won’t be available on Xbox Game Pass.

Did it take off without a wheel?

Smooth landing, rough questions

Passengers aboard Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight PK-306 got an unexpected surprise when their aircraft landed in Lahore—with one of its rear wheels missing. Despite what sounds like a scene from an action movie, the landing was smooth, and no injuries were reported.The big mystery now: Did the wheel vanish midair or was it never there to begin with?PIA officials have launched an investigation to determine whether the aircraft took off from Karachi already missing a wheel or if it fell off during takeoff. Some wheel fragments were reportedly found at Karachi airport, raising eyebrows about the plane’s condition before departure.""It appears that one of the rear wheels was in shabby condition when the aircraft took off,"" an official admitted, reported PTI.PIA’s damage control mode kicked in quickly. A spokesperson assured that the landing was “smooth and uneventful,” and passengers disembarked as usual—only for the captain’s routine inspection to reveal the missing wheel .""Passengers disembarked as per routine.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What EU wants from Apple

US President Donald Trump may see this as 'provocation'

The European Union has taken a significant step in enforcing its Digital Markets Act (DMA), targeting tech giant Apple with a detailed set of requirements aimed at opening up the iPhone's ecosystem to third-party connected devices. The announcement, made today, builds on last fall's specification procedures and outlines specific integrations the EU Commission expects Apple to implement, including access to iOS notifications, AirDrop-like file sharing, and AirPlay streaming for competitors.Teresa Ribera, the EU's antitrust chief, emphasized the bloc's commitment to compliance with the DMA. ""Let me be clear: Our main focus is creating a culture of compliance,"" she said in a statement. Ribera hailed the measure against Apple as an ""important step"" toward dismantling the company's tightly controlled ecosystem.Apple, however, sharply criticized the EU's decision. ""Today’s decisions wrap us in red tape,"" the company said in a statement. ""It’s bad for our products and for our European users."" The tech giant argues that the mandated changes will complicate its operations and compromise the user experience.The EU's demands are extensive. Third-party smartwatches must gain full access to iOS notifications and background execution privileges, mirroring the functionality of the Apple Watch. Headphone manufacturers will be granted access to features like proximity auto-pairing and automatic audio switching, currently exclusive to AirPods. Beyond these examples, the EU insists that all Apple features tied to first-party hardware integrations—present and future—must be made available to third-party companies at no cost, with relevant frameworks and APIs released concurrently with Apple's own platform updates.The decision has broader implications, signaling the EU's intent to ensure seamless interoperability across all types of connected devices. However, it could also stoke tensions across the Atlantic. U.S. President Donald Trump, a vocal critic of the EU's antitrust actions, may view this move -- and any future penalties -- as a provocation. Trump has previously likened the bloc's fines to tariffs against the U.S., and with his administration already engaged in a trade dispute over steel and aluminum tariffs, further EU actions could escalate into a tit-for-tat confrontation.As the DMA continues to reshape the tech landscape, today's ruling marks a pivotal moment in the EU's push to level the playing field, setting the stage for a potential showdown between Brussels and Silicon Valley -- and possibly Washington.","EU demands Apple open up iPhone's ecosystem to third-party connected devices.
