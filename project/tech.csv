Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

Hackers are exploiting Microsoft Teams to launch sophisticated ransomware attacks against corporations globally. In a new wave of cyberattacks , criminals are impersonating corporate help desk staff to trick employees into installing malicious software , ultimately deploying the BlackBasta ransomware.According to a report by US-based cybersecurity company ReliaQuest (via Bleeping Computer), Black Basta is a ransomware operation that has been active since April 2022. The group is said to be one of the branches of the disbanded Conti cybercrime syndicate that was shut down in June 2022.Black Basta members breach corporate networks through various methods, including vulnerabilities, partnering wish malware botnets and social engineering .Previously, BlackBasta group used to flood employees' inboxes with non-malicious emails and then pose as IT help desk staff over the phone to offer assistance over ‘ongoing’ cyber attack’. The employee contacted would then be tricked into installing remote access tools like AnyDesk or enabling Windows Quick Assist, giving the attackers access to the network.Now, instead of phone calls, the attackers are utilising Microsoft Teams to contact employees. They impersonate IT help desk personnel through external user accounts with deceptive display names like “Help Desk.”""These external users set their profiles to a 'DisplayName' designed to make the targeted user think they were communicating with a help-desk account,"" the report says.""In almost all instances we've observed, the display name included the string 'Help Desk,' often surrounded by whitespace characters, which is likely to center the name within the chat. We also observed that, typically, targeted users were added to a 'OneOnOne' chat,"" it added.They also create a convincing illusion of legitimacy, leading employees to believe they are interacting with internal support staff. Once the contact is established, the attackers then trick employees into installing remote access tools or enabling Quick Assist, eventually having access to the company system.","Hackers are exploiting Microsoft Teams to launch sophisticated ransomware attacks against corporations globally.

The latest update brings a modern scrollbar design to the main Contacts tab, replacing the previous, blocky version.The new scrollbar boasts a sleek pill-shaped design with dynamic theming, similar to that found in the Pixel Launcher's app drawer. This update brings the Contacts app more in line with Google's current Material You design language, creating a cleaner and more cohesive visual experience.Along with the scrollbar redesign, the update also removes the dedicated overflow menu from the search bar. Now, users can access the ""Select all"" option by long-pressing a single or multiple contacts.These subtle changes aim to improve the overall usability of the Contacts app. The thinner, modern scrollbar allows for better viewing of contact names without obstructing the list.

Apple Vision Pro users may soon be able to view spatial photos and videos directly in the Safari web browser . In a conversation with PetaPixel, Apple’s Product Manager Della Huff and Design Tema member Billy Sorrentino has revealed that the company will support spatial photos and videos within the Safari web browser. This addition will allow app and web developers to show spatial media to Vision Pro users and 2D media to others.This addition will offer another way for users of Apple’s first-ever mixed reality headset to experience the immersive content captured on iPhones. This feature will also allow for easier sharing and viewing of spatial media beyond the limitations of the Photos app and third-party apps. Currently, spatial photos and videos, which are shot on iPhone 15 Pro and all iPhone 16 models, are primarily viewable within the Photos app on the Vision Pro headset. While some third-party apps attempt to facilitate sharing, they often add complexity to the process.These reported steps will help Apple make spatial content more accessible by adding native support for it in the Safari web browser later this year. Currently, viewing spatial photos and videos on a Vision Pro requires accessing the files directly, limiting its usability to the ones which are sent directly to the device via iMessage, Airdrop. This upcoming update aims to improve the process and encourage wider adoption of this format.In the report, Sorrentino said: “And at the same time, you can create all sorts of photos into spatial photos [in Vision Pro] including old historical photos. You could do this to all your old product reviews, you could do it to World War II photos, video game screenshots I mean, what's so cool about this technology is it gives us the ability to take things into that next dimension.”This update will allow websites and social media platforms to integrate spatial photos and videos directly into their content, making this immersive format more accessible to everyone. Users without an Apple Vision Pro won't miss out, as they can still view standard photos and videos.

"Apple awarded $250 in patent fight with Masimo, company says “we’re not here for…”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-awarded-250-in-patent-fight-with-masimo-company-says-were-not-here-for/articleshow/114620882.cms,"What Apple’s attorney said

What the jury found

Apple has a ‘small’ win in its legal battle with medical device maker Masimo. A federal jury has ruled in favour of the iPhone maker in a patent infringement lawsuit against Masimo, awarding the tech giant a symbolic $250 in damages.According to a report by Bloomberg, the jury found that Masimo's original smartwatch designs and charger infringed on Apple Watch design patents, marking the latest development in a long-running legal battle between the two companies over smartwatch technology.The Apple attorney said that the company is not here for money but wants Masimo to stop copying its design.“We’re not here for the money. We want them to stop copying our design” and features,” Apple attorney said, lambasting Masimo for focusing on its innovations in pulse oximetry, the blood-oxygen measurement feature.An Apple spokesperson said that “teams at Apple worked for years to develop Apple Watch,” while “Masimo took shortcuts, launching a device that copies Apple Watch and infringes our intellectual property.”Masimo, on the other hand, celebrated the verdict as a victory, stating that the jury's focus on discontinued products undermines Apple's claims of irreparable harm.“Apple primarily sought an injunction against Masimo’s current products, and the jury’s verdict is a victory for Masimo on that issue,” Masimo’s statement said.The jury found that Masimo’s W1 smartwatch, Freedom smartwatch, and health module infringed on one patent, while Masimo’s charger infringed on another, as per the verdict form. The jury also found that Masimo’s infringement was willful.","A federal jury has ruled in favour of the iPhone maker in a patent infringement lawsuit against Masimo, awarding the tech giant a symbolic $250 in damages.
