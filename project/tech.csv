Go to the official CIBIL website and click on 'Personal CIBIL score,' then 'Get Your Free CIBIL score.' Follow the link provided and fill in all the required details.2. If you don’t have a PAN Card, you can use an alternative identification such as Passport, Voter ID, Driver’s License, or Ration Card. Enter the number of the chosen ID.3.

Authenticate your identity by entering the OTP (One-Time Password) delivered to your mobile device on the next screen. Click 'Continue' to proceed.5.

Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5. Number of new accounts opened and number of accounts closed: Opening or closing accounts can affect your score, so managing these actions wisely is important.","Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Google has won a lawsuit over Google Play gift card scams with a judge ruling that the tech company is not liable for losses incurred by such fraud. A lawsuit claimed that the search giant illegally profited from gift card scams by refusing to refund victims.Citing a decision by US District Judge Beth Labson Freeman, news agency Reuters reported that the plaintiff, Judy May, has failed to demonstrate that Google caused her losses or knowingly received stolen funds. May lost $1,000 in a scam where she was tricked into buying Google Play gift cards.The judge also determined that Google was not liable for retaining its standard commissions –15% to 30% – on purchases made with the gift cards, as this practice was unrelated to the initial fraud.While Freeman dismissed the lawsuit, she granted May the option to refile her case. However, a claim for triple damages was permanently dismissed, the report said.A class action lawsuit against Google was filed earlier this year, alleging that the tech giant illegally profited from gift card scams by refusing to refund victims.The lawsuit stemmed from a $1,000 loss suffered by Indiana resident Judy May, who fell victim to a scammer posing as a relative. The scammer convinced May to purchase Google Play gift cards under the pretence of securing federal grant money. May provided the gift card codes to the scammer, who then used them to make purchases.A class action complaint claimed that “over nearly a decade, Google has knowingly kept millions of dollars in stolen money from victims of gift card scams who purchased Google Play gift cards.”The lawsuit argued that Google should have warned consumers about scams on gift card packaging andthat anyone demanding payment with the cards was a scammer. She also accused the company of profiting from the fraudulent activity by keeping commissions on purchases made with stolen gift cards.","Judy May lost $1,000 in a scam where she was tricked into buying Google Play gift cards.

How Tamil Rockers make illegal copies of new movies



How this piracy website is a concern for the film industry



Jeb Stephen Raj, one of the key the administrator of the notorious piracy website Tamil Rockers , has confessed to illegally recording movies in theatres during a police investigation. Raj, arrested in July for illegally recording the film ""Raayan,"" revealed the tactics he and his team used to capture and distribute pirated movies. Raj was caught in Thiruvananthapuram using a mobile phone hidden in a theatre seat cup holder to record Dhanush's 50th film. His confession sheds light on the methods employed by piracy groups to obtain and distribute copyrighted content illegally.The accused, who had been illegally recording new movie releases in theatres for years, confessed to his methods during the investigation. He revealed that his team would book five tickets on the first day of release, strategically positioning themselves in the middle seat. Under the cover of a blanket, they would use a hidden camera to record the film, receiving Rs 5,000 for each recording. This operation spanned theatres across Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka.Piracy websites like these hurt the film industry with significant financial losses caused by unlawful distribution. Tamil Rockers, the notorious piracy website that has plagued the film industry for years by rapidly uploading new movies and making them available on the internet within a few hours after their theatre release.Despite numerous attempts to crack down on the operation, details about the group remained elusive until a successful police operation in Thiruvananthapuram in July led to the arrest of one of the key administrators of the site.While the arrest of Jeb Stephen Raj is a significant blow to Tamil Rockers, authorities believe he is not the main administrator, and the fight against the piracy network continues. This was evident after Rajinikanth's new movie ""Vettaiyan"" was leaked on the same day as its theatrical release. Despite this, the film is performing well at the box office.","Jeb Stephen Raj, one of the key the administrator of the notorious piracy website Tamil Rockers, has confessed to illegally recording movies in theatres.

Apple wants its employees to share feedback

Apple is reportedly exploring new ways to provide augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) content to its users. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple is conducting a new internal study focusing on building smart glasses. As per the report, the group responsible for the initiative wrote an email to selected employees confirming the studies on products in this segment.The initiative is called ‘Atlas’ and started last week. The email, sent to select Apple employees reads “Testing and developing products that all can come to love is very important to what we do at Apple. This is why we are looking for participants to join us in an upcoming user study with current market smart glasses”.The study suggests that Apple wants to push ahead with the idea of building its own smart glasses. Apple debuted the Vision Pro but it isn’t a huge success.Earlier Gurman suggested that the tech giant is developing smart glasses and AirPods equipped with cameras, with a potential launch date of 2027, though this is subject to change. These new products would mark a significant expansion of Apple's vision-based technology. The smart glasses are anticipated to be similar to Meta's Ray-Ban Stories, offering built-in cameras, speakers, and microphones. This could potentially allow users to capture photos and videos, make calls, and interact with AR experiences overlaid on the real world.","Apple is reportedly exploring new ways to provide augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) content to its users.

Mandeep Manocha is co-founder and CEO of Cashify, a leading online marketplace for refurbished electronics . With over 12 years at the helm, Mandeep has guided Cashify 's growth Prior to Cashify, he founded and led ZazzyBox and Manak Waste Management. His experience also includes a stint in investment banking at Lehman Brothers. Mandeep holds a Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from Panjab University. In an interaction with Times of India, Mandeep talked about Cashify's growth over the years, refurbished market and importance of sustainability. Excerpts:We started in 2013-2014, Our motivation was simple: we were driven by the idea of preventing e-waste. We saw a huge opportunity to extend the life of used devices. My co-founders and I come from a waste management background. We started a company in 2009 and spent a significant amount of time on actual waste management projects, including setting up and running a plastic and rubber waste recycling factory for two or three years. We became interested in electronic waste, but we realized that e-waste isn't really e-waste until it sits unused in your house.There were two reasons: First, we believe that our consumers are everywhere. They're both online and offline. Second, because we buy used devices, we refurbish and resell them. We realized about four years ago that trust was missing in the refurbished space. To build trust, we needed a physical touch-and-feel store where people could experience the phones firsthand. Every phone we sell could be different, so having a physical store helps people build trust. These offline stores also serve as service centers. At Cashify, we are also investing in technology to further streamline our operations and enhance the customer experience.As for numbers, our stores are spread across the top 90 cities in the country. We have stores in all major cities like Bangalore, Delhi, etc., as well as smaller cities like Agra, Meerut, and other tier two and tier three cities.Yes, one can. But, we accept devices up to a certain age. For older devices, we offer a recycling program. This means that we will take your old, but we may not be able to give you a value for it. We have a service where we will pick it up from your doorstep, send it to an authorized e-waste recycler, and send you a certificate of destruction via email.Right now, we only do it for phones. We will be launching laptop recycling soon.Our core mission is to extend the life of devices, reducing the need for new production and minimizing e-waste. By refurbishing and reselling, we aim to contribute to a more sustainable future. We are also exploring initiatives like recycling programs and partnerships with brands to promote e-waste awareness. Cashify is committed to making a positive impact on the environment and providing affordable, high-quality devices to its customers. By choosing refurbished, you're not just saving money but also contributing to a greener future. We work with all OEMs in the country. Whichever OEM you name, we are there at the backend.Interestingly, it's benefited us. People are opting for refurbished devices as a more affordable alternative. We have seen a surge in demand for our refurbished products.We have our own state-of-the-art facility in Noida where we refurbish devices. Our expert technicians meticulously inspect and repair each device. We wanted to have one concentrated facility because refurbishing operations cannot be run in a very decentralized manner. Managing spare parts is a huge challenge. Noida has all those phone manufacturers, trained manpower, and spare parts easily available. Cashify also offers warranties on our refurbished products, it ranges from six to twelve months, depending on the model.We work closely with major retailers to provide buyback and refurbished device solutions. This includes partnerships with OEMs and retailers like Croma, Vijay Sales, Reliance Digital, and Apple authorized resellers.I wouldn't say it's the biggest season, but it's definitely a good one. We see a significant spike in the number of old phones coming to us. During that one month, the inflow of devices increases by at least 3-4 times.Yes, I recommend that people sell their devices as soon as they buy a new one. People often think they'll use their old device as a spare or hand it down, but that doesn't usually happen. They end up putting it in a drawer. Ideally, you should sell it immediately when you upgrade so you can get the best value. If you keep it in a drawer, it will eventually become e-waste and you won't get anything for it. These are valuable resources that are lying unused in people's homes. By selling them, you can extend their life and make them available to others. We've seen that this brings happiness to a lot of people. People are happy to buy an old iPhone 11 or iPhone 12 at a lower price. I've seen people from various demographics who are thrilled to get a phone like that for 25,000 rupees, which they couldn't afford new.","Mandeep Manocha is co-founder and CEO of Cashify, a leading online marketplace for refurbished electronics.

"Google may soon make this Android file sharing feature available on iPhone, Mac",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-may-soon-make-this-android-file-sharing-feature-available-on-iphone-mac/articleshow/114952159.cms,"Android’s Quick Share on iPhones and Macs: What to expect



Google launching products for competing platforms



Google's Quick Share file-transfer service may soon be available for iPhone and Mac users. A recent code change that was discovered in the project's source code repository suggests that this feature will allow users to easily share files between Android and Apple devices. Quick Share, introduced in 2020, utilizes a local network connection to quickly transfer files between devices and works only between Android and Windows devices. It comes pre-installed on most Android phones and Chromebooks and can be easily installed on Windows PCs. However, iOS and macOS users have been unable to utilise this convenient feature. The recent code changes suggest that Google is actively working to expand Quick Share's compatibility to include Apple's operating systems.According to a report by Android Authority’s Mishaal Rahman, a recent bug fix in Google's Nearby Connections code hints at the possibility of Quick Share coming to iOS and macOS. The fix addresses an issue with localised device names, specifically mentioning its benefit for Quick Share on Apple's platforms, even though there's no official Quick Share app for them yet.While this could indicate Google's plans to bring Quick Share to iOS and macOS, it's also possible that they are simply fixing bugs proactively or laying the groundwork for future development. The exact intentions remain unclear as Quick Share's source code is not publicly available.While Google hasn’t officially confirmed plans for Quick Share on iOS and macOS, it wouldn't be a surprise as the company has already released the feature for Windows. However, achieving widespread adoption on Apple platforms presents a challenge.Distributing Quick Share as a standalone app may also face hurdles in convincing iPhone users to download it while integrating it into existing Google apps could be difficult due to permission limitations on iOS. Despite these challenges, expanding Quick Share to Apple devices could promote cross-platform compatibility and benefit users across ecosystems.","Google's Quick Share file-transfer service may soon be available for iPhone and Mac users. A recent code change that was discovered in the project's source code repository suggests that this feature will allow users to easily share files between Android and Apple devices. Quick Share, introduced in 2020, utilizes a local network connection to quickly transfer files between devices.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114952147,imgsize-11968,width-400,resizemode-4/114952147.jpg"
Bears Trade Khalil Herbert to Bengals for 2025 Draft Pick,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/bears-trade-khalil-herbert-to-bengals-for-2025-draft-pick/articleshow/114991185.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

New Opportunity for Khalil Herbert



Impact on the Bears Roster

Shockingly, the Chicago Bears traded running back Khalil Herbert to the Cincinnati Bengals for a 2025 seventh-round draft pick, according to NFL insider Tom Pelissero. The trade will work well for both sides currently and in the long term. He becomes an important addition to provide the Bengals with some more running back depth , and, at this point, there's not much that doesn't qualify him for all sorts of roles in this offense. Herbert's great ability to find space in the running game and produce yards after contact makes him a perfect fit for a Cincinnati offense that has traditionally used a balanced running game in support of its dynamic passing attack.Also Read - How NFL Players Invest It is something new for Herbert, at least. Joe Mixon is too deep-rooted as an everyday Bengals' running back to feel any particular threat. But there may be an opportunity here as a change-of-pace tailback with possible usage on the goal line or in certain situations. The Bengals prefer to run the football and those are running situations where Herbert should really establish himself. This is a significant step for Herbert to allow him to mature into a more high-powered offense with some sort of playoff aspirations in mind.The trade does two things for the Bears: it signals that their position on the running back is changing, because the team has such depth. An emphasis on finding younger talent, and making a trade for Herbert gives the Bears the flexibility for the future. The seventh-round pick is not something to place a lot of value on, but it's still another pick added to the Bears' growing stockpile of picks as they rebuild and refine their team for the future. This also may clear the way for other running backs on the roster to step up and fill Herbert's role.Also Read - Record Breaking Viewership of NFL",The Chicago Bears traded running back Khalil Herbert to the Cincinnati Bengals for a 2025 seventh-round draft pick.

Detroit Lions Acquire Za'Darius Smith—A Pro-Bowl Talent or a High-Risk Investment?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/detroit-lions-acquire-zadarius-smitha-pro-bowl-talent-or-a-high-risk-investment/articleshow/114986486.cms,"Image via AP

Za'Darius Smith: A Proven Pass-Rusher



Browns Trade Rumors Are HOT: David Njoku Trade Coming? Za’Darius Smith To The Lions?

The Lions' Defense Revamp



Cleveland Browns On to the Next



What This Means for Detroit



In their effort to strengthen the line, the Detroit Lions will reportedly trade with the Cleveland Browns for former Pro Bowl defensive end Za'Darius Smith. It is the kind of acquisition that a struggling Lions team has been wanting: more depth and better talent to bolster the defense next season. Smith is one of those players who could easily come in and change the whole face of Detroit's defensive unit, thanks to his pass-rushing prowess and presence on the field.Za'Darius Smith, Baltimore Ravens fourth-round draft pick in 2015, has grown to become one of the top pass rushers in the league over the years. He was a Pro Bowl selection in 2019 with the Green Bay Packers, where he tallied 13.5 sacks. Smith is famous for his motor that never stops and can put pressure on opposing quarterbacks. He spent two years with the Green Bay Packers, then was traded to Cleveland in 2023 and played one year for that team before being traded again, this time to Detroit.Also Read - How NFL Players Invest This would mean that with Smith being signed with the Lions, this is a huge boost for their defensive line. For several years now, the Lions have strived hard to build up its defense. With Smith entering the Lions, the overall strength of their pass rush will improve. The Lions have heavily invested in putting together a defense that matches the best offenses in the league, and Smith's old experience and ability to shake up the quarterback will bring more flavor to their game plan.This is a trade for Cleveland Browns as they are shifting their approach to the roster build. Although Smith played a crucial role in the defense of the 2023 season, the team has decided to let him go and invest their resources in building elsewhere. This will then give other players on the list an opportunity to shine during Smith's absence.With the increase in a much-needed position for Za'Darius Smith to come into the defensive formation of Detroit Lions, such is a perfect edge rusher who wreaks havoc throughout the game in the backfield; with this increase going forward while the Lions attempt to prepare their team more for another playoff push into seasons, such experience and generated pressure can be seen among themselves.Also Read - Record Breaking Viewership of NFL","Za'Darius Smith was a Pro Bowl selection in 2019 with the Green Bay Packers, where he tallied 13.5 sacks.

Giannis Antetokounmpo’s leadership under scrutiny amid trade speculations after recent defeat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/giannis-antetokounmpos-leadership-under-scrutiny-amid-trade-speculations-after-recent-defeat/articleshow/114999553.cms,"Image via: NBA

Giannis Antetokounmpo’s trade rumor and scrutiny spark discussion



Trade rumors are making a wave of discussion as the Milwaukee Bucks stumble early this season which sparked talk of a possible shake-up. It could involve moving superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo . Considering the Bucks’ poor start, some question whether it’s time to think big changes. Also, if the Bucks were to make Giannis available several teams would jump at the chance to acquire him.Also Read: NBA Star Jalen Green’s Girlfriend Draya Michele Endorses Kamala Harris Rumors are circulating that the NBA’s top teams are ready to enter bidding wars for Giannis Antetokounmpo. However, everyone is not impressed with it. Former NBA champ Kendrick Perkins explosively stated, “Look, Giannis is the one that made this bed. He’s the one that got to lay in it.” ESPN's Stephen A. Smith and Shannon Sharpe have joined the discussion as well. Smith previously hinted that Antetokounmpo likely had a say in firing head coach Adrian Griffin and even pushed for Doc Rivers as his replacement. According to Smith, this whole plan may have been Giannis’s vision from the start.Joining the discussion Big Perk said, “Mike Budenholzer got fired as well, a guy that they won a championship with. And then all of a sudden you fire Adrian Griffin. Giannis forced the hand to trade for Damian Lillard and got Jrue Holiday out of there.”The New York Knicks might not be a top contender to book Giannis Antetokounmpo if he becomes available for trade, according to Stefan Bondy of the New York Post. Bondy recently shared that it's ""very unlikely"" New York could put together an offer attractive enough for the Bucks. The speculation is supported by the fact that they used many valuable assets to acquire Mikal Bridges and, later, Karl-Anthony Towns. So, the Knicks would likely struggle to match Milwaukee’s asking price.Shortly after the Bucks stumbled to a 1-5 season start, NBA insider Marc Stein reported that ""leaguewide lusting for Giannis has thus started anew."" According to Stein, teams like the Knicks, Brooklyn Nets, Golden State Warriors, and Miami Heat are already emerging as potential contenders, forming what he calls ""a credible list"" of early suitors. With Milwaukee’s rough start, the anticipation around a possible Antetokounmpo trade is accelerating quickly across the league.Also Read: Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich sidelined indefinitely due to health concerns","NBA insider Marc Stein reported that ""leaguewide lusting for Giannis has thus started anew"" The New York Knicks might not be a top contender to book Giannis Antetokounmpo.
