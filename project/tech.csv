Taylor Swift was accused of copying a Black-owned brand's design on her Folklore album merch

Taylor Swift’s romance with Travis Kelce reignites debate over her past controversies and brand power

In 2020, Taylor Swift faced backlash after Black entrepreneur Amira Rasool accused her team of copying a design from her fashion brand for Folklore merchandise. As Swift's romance with NFL star Travis Kelce now amplifies her spotlight, past controversies are resurfacing, sparking renewed discussions about celebrity, ethics, and accountability.Back in July 2020, Taylor Swift found herself in the middle of a design controversy shortly after the release of her critically acclaimed album Folklore. A Black female entrepreneur, Amira Rasool, called out the pop star’s merchandise line for allegedly copying her brand’s logo style. Rasool, founder of The Folklore—a retailer focused on African designers—publicly criticized Swift’s team, stating, “I am not going to let this blatant theft go unchecked. ”Rasool’s accusation centered around the specific use of the phrase “the folklore album” on some of the merch. She claimed the typography and layout closely resembled her own brand’s identity, which had been in use well before the album dropped.Swift’s team, however, took a proactive and respectful stance. In a public statement, they clarified, “Yesterday, we were made aware of a complaint that the specific use of the word 'the' before 'folklore album' on some of the folklore album merchandise was of concern.Absolutely no merchandise using 'the' before the words 'folklore album' has been manufactured or sent out.” They went on to explain that in “good faith,” they honored Rasool’s request and alerted customers that their orders would feature a modified design.Rasool appreciated the response, tweeting, “I commend Taylor's team for recognizing the damage the merchandise caused to my company @TheFolklore's brand. I recognize that she has been a strong advocate for women protecting their creative rights, so it was good to see her team is on the same page.”Now, with Swift’s romance with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce becoming pop culture gold, her reputation for navigating controversies with professionalism is again being praised. As fans celebrate the singer’s love life and career success, moments like this underscore Swift’s commitment to empowering female creatives—both on and off the stage.Also Read: NFL or TMZ?

An NRI handle on Instagram replied to the viral video of 'Indian takeover of Frisco' and said Indians are visible at Costco because they live there, work there and pay taxes there.

The rise of AI in healthcare is inevitable, but its role must be clearly defined and carefully regulated. Illinois has taken a groundbreaking step by banning AI platforms like ChatGPT from delivering therapy or mental health assessments without supervision by licensed professionals. Signed into law by Governor JB Pritzker, this legislation addresses growing ethical and safety concerns surrounding AI’s expanding role in mental healthcare. While AI tools offer efficiency and accessibility, they lack the empathy, nuanced understanding, and accountability essential for sensitive mental health support.The law ensures that treatment plans and emotional evaluations remain firmly in human hands, protecting vulnerable individuals from potential harm caused by unregulated AI advice and misdiagnosis. Illinois’ move sets a precedent for responsible AI use in healthcare, emphasising that technology ‘should assist, not replace’ qualified mental health professionals in delivering compassionate, ethical, and effective care.Under the newly introduced Wellness and Oversight for Psychological Resources Act, AI chatbots and platforms are strictly prohibited from:Unless these actions are supervised by a licensed mental health professional, they are deemed illegal under state law. Violators of this regulation could face penalties of up to $10,000 per violation, as enforced by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR). The law is designed to ensure that human expertise, emotional intelligence, and ethical standards remain central to the therapy process.With this law, Illinois becomes a trailblazer in responsible AI governance. By defining what AI can and cannot do in healthcare, the state sets a critical precedent for the rest of the nation.Rather than stifle technology, this law ensures that AI development proceeds with ethical boundaries — especially when human lives and emotions are on the line. Illinois is not the only state moving toward regulating AI’s role in therapy. Other states are joining the effort to draw clear lines between acceptable AI use and areas requiring human judgment.These actions reflect a national trend: mental healthcare must prioritise ethics, accountability, and human empathy, even in an AI-driven world.At the heart of this decision is a growing concern that AI lacks the emotional intelligence and ethical grounding necessary for mental health care. While generative AI systems like ChatGPT have demonstrated impressive capabilities in simulating conversations, they cannot truly understand or respond to human emotions in context, especially during crises, trauma, or complex interpersonal dynamics where empathy, nuance, and moral judgment are crucial for effective support.Mario Treto Jr., Secretary of the IDFPR, said, “The people of Illinois deserve quality healthcare from real, qualified professionals and not computer programs.” This law protects vulnerable individuals from placing trust in a machine that might misunderstand or mishandle emotional crises.The American Psychological Association (APA) has been sounding the alarm since early 2025. In a report to federal regulators, the APA raised serious concerns over AI-driven chatbots pretending to be licensed therapists. These bots, while unregulated, have allegedly caused real-world harm.These events underscore the urgent need to prevent unregulated AI from entering sensitive domains where lives could be at stake.Illinois’ law doesn’t completely ban AI from mental healthcare — rather, it limits its application to non-clinical support roles.AI can still be used for:This approach encourages innovation without sacrificing safety.

Elon Musk’s xAI has introduced Grok Imagine , a powerful new feature in its Grok AI platform that allows users to generate images and short video clips from simple text prompts.

The rollout aligns with xAI’s strategy to reserve advanced features for paid tiers, mirroring the premium access model used by other generative platforms.One of the most talked-about additions to Grok Imagine is its “Spicy Mode”, which, according to a report by TechCrunch, enables users to generate content that includes partial nudity and sexually suggestive visuals.Despite this, the app enforces content moderation. Users trying to push boundaries often receive blurred or blocked results.

Epic Games is set to roll out Fortnite’s Chapter 6 Season 4 update, titled ""Shock 'N Awesome,"" very soon. However, ahead of the update’s release, the game is going through scheduled global downtime. This downtime is expected to end before the release of the Shock 'N Awesome update, which has rendered the game unplayable for players across the world. The upcoming update will focus on a mechanical insectoid bug invasion and will even feature a collaboration with the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.

Once a Fortnite season concludes, servers usually remain offline for about two to five hours before the next season becomes accessible.However, it can take much longer, like the 18-hour downtime before Chapter 5, Season 2. If things go smoothly, the servers will be back within the next few hours.Epic Games has announced that Fortnite’s v37.00 update is one of the most substantial seasonal updates so far, potentially requiring longer-than-usual downtime.

New mobility-focused gameplay mechanics and Power Rangers-inspired Battle Pass items are expected. Technical upgrades and quality-of-life improvements will also roll out gradually after the v37.00 update.The patch also brings various bug fixes across Fortnite modes, including Battle Royale, LEGO Fortnite, Rocket Racing, and Save the World. Notable fixes include locker UI glitches, mobile control issues, and model display problems.

These included Section 121A – (Conspiracy to overthrow the state authority by force), 120B (Criminal conspiracy), 396 (Dacoity with murder), and 207 (fraudulent claim to property).In one of the last writings, Rajendra Nath Lahiri, then lodged in Gonda jail on Dec 14, 1927, writes: “What is death? Nothing but the other face of life.And what is life? Merely the other face of death. Then what is there to fear? It is a natural event—just as natural as the sunrise in the morning. If it is true, as we believe, that history turns its pages, then I believe our sacrifice will not go in vain. My salutations, a final salute to all. ”Highlighting the unique collection on display, director general, prisons, PC Meena says, “The museum houses several rare and invaluable documents related to the Kakori Train Action, including court records, archival newspaper clippings, and official correspondence. These materials offer a vivid glimpse into the bravery and sacrifice of the revolutionaries who laid down their lives for India’s independence. ” Calling it a national heritage, Meena says, “The Kakori Train Action is a golden chapter in India’s freedom movement. The artefacts and documents linked to this event are part of our cultural and historical legacy and preserving them is a collective responsibility.”","A first-of-its-kind museum has been inaugurated inside the state prison headquarters.

Then, she uses red paint to change the word “genes” to “jeans” and says in a voiceover: “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color.My jeans are blue.”The tagline read “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans” plays on the word “genes,” which many critics found problematic.Some accused the campaign of being overly sexualised and promoting outdated beauty standards, pointing to the focus on Sweeney’s blonde hair, blue eyes, and slim physique.Others went further, interpreting the wordplay as an unintended reference to eugenics, a theory historically used to promote racial superiority.Earlier on Friday, American Eagle in response issued a statement on Instagram saying the campaign “is and always was about the jeans.

The legendary paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren's home and museum in Monroe, Connecticut, which houses the notorious Annabelle doll, has been acquired by American comedian Matt Rife and his friend Elton Castee. A number of paranormal phenomena have been connected to the doll, a purportedly haunted antique, since the 1970s.Sharing a video on TikTok, he said, ""Ed and Lorraine Warren are who took demonology, ghost hunting, and paranormal investigation and made it mainstream. Now, I know a lot of you don't know what any of this means whatsoever, but if you follow ghost stuff, this is about as big as it gets.""Rife expressed his interest in buying the museum and the doll in his post, saying that he is ""obsessed"" with the paranormal and everything haunted, particularly ""The Conjuring"" series. ""This is the most random hobby ever, but it's so (expletive) cool,"" he grinned.The popularity of the Conjuring series, which brought viewers back to a scary haunting artifact—the Annabelle doll—brought Warren's back into the spotlight.

The star of Euphoria and The White Lotus has, quite by accident, become a MAGA icon. All it took was a leaked Republican voter registration, a denim ad campaign misread as a white supremacist dog whistle, and a shooting range video that could’ve doubled as NRA propaganda. Welcome to 2025, where political identity is crafted less by what you say, and more by which side claims you.

Why MAGA Can’t Stop Posting Her



She’s young. The GOP’s problem has always been youth appeal. Sydney solves that.

She’s beautiful. Liberal feminists would call that “problematic.” The Right calls it reality.

She’s talented. Awards, praise, and prestige roles, all without being preachy.

She’s silent. No need to cancel. No need to apologise. No moral panic. Just vibes.

The Mirror, Not the Mouthpiece







In the first of the Republican National Conservative debates, when Trump steadfastly refused to participate to show Fox who was the man, then-presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy summed up the inflection point that was about to overshadow America: “You want to be a rebel? You want to be a hippie? You want to ‘stick it to the man’? Show up on your college campus and try calling yourself a conservative. ”It’s true. Being liberal used to be an act of rebellion. But that rebellion became mainstream, corporatised, and institutionalised. It now lives on as HR slideshows, Twitter mobs, and avocado ad campaigns. Being young and Republican in 2025 is an act of defiance. And today’s protestants become tomorrow’s mainstream—evidenced by the fact that there are now more young people who identify as Republican than Democrat in America.It’s not clear when the Left lost the youth. Perhaps it was the cascade of madness: the woke craze of pushing trans behaviour in grammar schools. Demanding biological males be allowed to play in women’s sports. Saying illegal immigrants should have unfettered access to welfare. Shouting “Defund the Police” while shoplifting turned into organised retail looting. Declaring obesity a form of body positivity. Telling working-class white kids that their skin colour was an inherited sin.Declaring that whiteness ought to be apologised for.Slowly, the country shifted. Not by campaign ads or policy briefings—but by exhaustion. And as America began tuning out the moral lectures from elites, late-night comedians, and Hollywood, a new icon quietly emerged. Not a pundit. Not a senator. Not a firebrand. A muse.In an era where even a sneeze can be interpreted as a political statement, Sydney Sweeney has become the conservative darling of the year—without attending a single rally or issuing a single press release. The star of Euphoria and The White Lotus has, quite by accident, become a MAGA icon. All it took was a leaked Republican voter registration, a denim ad campaign misread as a white supremacist dog whistle, and a shooting range video that could’ve doubled as NRA propaganda. Welcome to 2025, where political identity is crafted less by what you say, and more by which side claims you.It recently emerged that Sydney Sweeney is registered as a Republican in Florida. That was it.She didn’t make a political speech. She didn’t wear a MAGA hat. She didn’t retweet Ben Shapiro. All she did was file the correct paperwork, and the internet found it. Her name. Her address. Her party.Suddenly, the Right had its new pin-up girl. The Left had a meltdown.For conservatives, this was a cultural coup. A beautiful, talented Hollywood starlet—young, blonde, wildly popular—was officially red. Not pink. Not centrist. Red. And best of all? She wasn’t saying sorry for it.The silence was glorious. No apology tour. No clarifying tweet. No “I was hacked” statement. Liberals demanded answers. Progressives called it a betrayal. But Sydney Sweeney didn’t flinch. And in an age where even Instagram captions are pored over for political subtext, saying nothing is a weapon.“Great Jeans” and the Eugenics Panic of Summer 2025Then came the American Eagle campaign.Sydney Sweeney, in tight denim and a tank top, staring into the camera under the caption: “Great Genes.”That’s it. That’s the ad.Within hours, the internet exploded. Not because of the fashion. Not because of the cut. But because of the word: “genes.” Not jeans. Genes.The Left read it as a eugenics dog whistle. A blonde-haired, blue-eyed woman fronting a brand with a tagline that sounded suspiciously like white supremacy.Satirical Twitter lit up: “This is Leni Riefenstahl for Gen Z.” “Are they selling pants or the master race?”But the Right? The Right cackled. This was proof. Proof that the outrage industry had gone too far. That even a pun could be labelled fascist. That Sydney Sweeney, just by existing in her natural body and not issuing trigger warnings, was now enemy number one.American Eagle didn’t back down. Sales spiked. The controversy became the campaign. Sydney didn’t write the tagline. She was just the face. But once again, the narrative moved around her. She became the accidental symbol of conservative resistance to liberal hysteria.And then the final seal was pressed: the shooting range video.Sydney, in casualwear and earmuffs, loading a Glock like she was born in Fort Benning. First-time shooter? Didn’t look like it. Her stance, her focus, her shot grouping—it was enough to make half of Republican Twitter swoon.Clips went viral:The symbolism was perfect. A young woman in Hollywood, not just pretending to shoot in a Netflix movie—but actually firing rounds at a paper target, calmly, confidently. No virtue signalling. No trembling hands. Just recoil and resolve.The Right didn't need words. The imagery was enough. Mainstream Republicans quickly rallied behind Sydney Sweeney. Vice President JD Vance criticised Democrats for “calling everyone who thinks Sydney Sweeney beautiful a Nazi,” saying it showed how out of touch the party had become with young voters. Senator Ted Cruz also weighed in, posting on X: “Wow. Now the crazy Left has come out against beautiful women. I’m sure that will poll well. ” Inside the White House, officials saw the controversy as a win, saying it helped highlight what they view as liberal overreach and cultural policing. For many Republicans, Sweeney’s party registration wasn’t just a detail—it was confirmation that the culture war was breaking their way.What makes Sydney Sweeney such a potent figure is precisely her ambiguity.She doesn’t tweet about taxes. She doesn’t complain about feminism. She doesn’t post “I Voted” stickers or abortion fundraisers. She doesn’t do red carpet activism. And in 2025, that absence speaks louder than any hashtag.Hollywood thrives on performative wokeness. Stars compete to signal their virtue—whether it's climate guilt on private jets or apologies for being cast as straight characters. Sydney Sweeney has opted out.That, to a large chunk of America, makes her radical. Because silence is now seen as alignment. Refusing to bend the knee is tantamount to opposition. And that’s why both sides are fighting to frame her.To liberals, she’s naive at best, complicit at worst. To conservatives, she’s a unicorn: the apolitical star who still represents everything they believe in—beauty, freedom, guns, and denim.What Sydney Sweeney represents is something new: the post-woke Hollywood icon. Not a right-wing activist. Not a left-wing darling. But someone who has managed to float above the trench warfare.This new archetype is defined by:She’s not talking about CRT, climate change, or colonialism. She’s talking about her dog. Or her workout. Or her skincare routine. And yet, her silence makes her subversive.She isn’t against the Left in any direct sense. She’s just not of it. And that distinction matters.There’s a reason conservative media can’t get enough of her:In other words, she’s the anti-Lena Dunham. The anti-Alyssa Milano. The anti-everything that drove red-state Americans away from Hollywood.The Culture War’s Most Valuable PawnSydney Sweeney didn’t ask to be drafted into the culture war. She just voted. Then modelled. Then fired a gun.But in the content economy, you don’t get to choose how you're used. She became a screen onto which America projected its anxieties and aspirations. And the fact that she never pushed back made her more powerful.The Right turned her into a meme. The Left turned her into a warning. And Sydney? Sydney went back to work. To movies. To photo shoots. To her life.That may be the most radical thing of all.Sydney Sweeney is not giving speeches. She’s not asking for your vote. She’s not applying to be the next Kayleigh McEnany.She is simply existing. But in 2025, that’s all it takes.She is a mirror—reflecting everything America wants to believe, or fears to acknowledge. To the Right, she’s the proof that Hollywood doesn’t own the narrative. To the Left, she’s a reminder that silence can be resistance too.And in a country where every movie, every tweet, every ad campaign becomes a battleground, Sydney Sweeney has done the unthinkable.She said nothing. And everyone heard it.","In an era where even a sneeze can be interpreted as a political statement, Sydney Sweeney has become the conservative darling of the year.

'We must confront them': British woman slammed for criticising Hindi-speaking staff at Heathrow; accused of racism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/we-must-confront-them-british-woman-slammed-for-criticising-hindi-speaking-staff-at-heathrow-accused-of-racism/articleshow/122933874.cms,"(Image: X @LucyJayneWhite1)





A British woman has come under fire after having an issue over Marks & Spencer employees at London Heathrow Airport speaking in Hindi. Lucy White, who describes herself as a public policy specialist, shared her incident in a post on X, which quickly went viral and drew widespread criticism. Many accused her of racism and intolerance in a multicultural environment.White wrote that she had just arrived at Terminal 3 of the airport and visited the M&S store, where she overheard three staff members speaking in a language other than English. When she asked them what language they were speaking, the employees told her it was Hindi, the most widely spoken language in India.“I have a voice recording & their names to report to M&S. We must confront them every time,” she added.Her post drew backlash with users online calling her racist and many questioning why she found it offensive and what rules the employees had broken.This incident is not the first time White has faced criticism for similar remarks. A few weeks ago, she posted another tweet targeting Indian and Asian employees at Heathrow, claiming they spoke “not a word of English.” She added that when she asked them to speak English, they called her a “racist.”One user, on her latest post, commented, “Confront people who talk in a different language? No thanks. We should however confront vile bigots like yourself that make this country a much sadder, less friendlier place.”Another user said, “How embarrassing. Heaven forbid someone speaks more than one language if they work in a major international airport.”","Lucy White shared her incident in a post on X, which quickly went viral and drew widespread criticism.

China witnessed a miracle when a boy, who is just three years old, miraculously survived an extraordinary 18-storey fall from his residential building, with a tree breaking his fall.The event occurred on July 15 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, southeastern China, while the young boy was under his grandparents' supervision, South China Morning Post reported.The grandparents had stepped out briefly to purchase groceries, believing the child was asleep. They secured the flat's door to ensure his safety.Upon waking, the child entered the bathroom, which had an unprotected window. He climbed onto the toilet and subsequently the window, from which he fell.A tree intercepted his fall, enabling his survival. His father later placed a large red flower on the tree in appreciation.A passing resident discovered him and recorded a video, sharing it with the property management.The father, Zhu, initially doubted the 18-storey fall until viewing surveillance footage. He explained that an open window on the 17th floor altered his son's falling path, directing him towards the tree that cushioned his landing.At the hospital, staff termed his survival miraculous. His injuries included a broken left arm, spinal strain and internal organ damage, though his head remained uninjured.Remarkably, the conscious child requested: ""Ask Daddy to buy me a Bumblebee.""Zhu presented a large red flower to the tree, a traditional Chinese symbol of honour. The incident sparked online discussions, with comments ranging from criticism of parental oversight to expressions of relief at the boy's survival.","Three-year-old boy falls from 18-storey building in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China.

TL;DR:

Qatar has installed over 300 fast EV chargers nationwide as of 1 August 2025 under its green mobility initiative.

Putin Snubs Trump’s Sanctions Ultimatum; Vows Total 'Ukrainian Conquest' In Final Showdown





What are EV chargers and what makes them “fast”?

AC chargers (Level 1 & 2) supply alternating current which is converted within the vehicle’s onboard charger before entering the battery, these are slower and typically used at homes or offices.





DC fast chargers bypass the vehicle’s converter and feed direct current straight to the battery—offering power outputs ranging from 50 kW to over 350 kW and enabling rapid charging.





Level 1 (trickle charging): Adds about 2–5 miles of range per hour.





Level 2: Delivers 10–30 miles of range per hour, suitable for overnight residential charging.





Level 3 (DC fast charging): Adds 20–60+ miles in just 15–30 minutes; ultra-fast chargers can deliver over 150 kW for even quicker fill-ups.









Why this expansion is important for Qatar

Supporting National Vision 2030

Enhancing Convenience and Reliability

Smart Infrastructure and User Engagement





Broader context: EV charging explained

EVSE devices support various connector standards: CCS (Combined Charging System), CHAdeMO, Type 2, and Tesla’s proprietary plugs, which differ regionally.





Smart chargers can optimise grid load, schedule charging during lower-tariff hours, and monitor performance, all of which are essential for modern EV networks).





The global EV charging landscape still navigates challenges like standardizing connectors and ensuring equitable access—a concern highlighted by users in Qatar living in apartments where charging access remains sparse.









Future outlook for Qatar’s EV ecosystem

Continued rollout of fast chargers in high-density and public zones to keep pace with rising EV adoption.





Broader integration of smart payment and scheduling tools, possibly incorporating Plug & Charge features like ISO 15118 for automatic billing and authentication.





Strategic planning to avoid grid strain as ultra-fast chargers proliferate, balancing speed and sustainability goals.













On 1 August 2025, Kahramaa, Qatar General Electricity and Water Corporation, announced that Qatar has surpassed 300 fast electric vehicle (EV) chargers, a major milestone in building a robust EV ecosystem aligned with its sustainability goals.During a community engagement event at Al Thumama's Kahramaa Awareness Park, engineers and EV users gathered to assess charger performance, usability, and discuss future expansions. The mobile app showcased allows users to track charging sessions, receive real‑time updates, and report issues, increasing transparency and control for EV drivers. Kahramaa officials emphasised that public feedback will shape further infrastructure enhancements.Looking ahead, plans include expanding charger availability in residential areas, shopping malls, and public parking zones to meet growing demand from EV owners.EV chargers, also known as electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), come in two major types: AC chargers and DC chargers.Charging speeds are categorized as:These fast chargers installed in Qatar fall under Level 3: high-voltage DC units capable of charging most EVs to 80% in under 30 minutes, ideal for roadside use, malls, and strategic hubs.The EV charging rollout aligns with Qatar’s broader strategy to diversify energy use, lower carbon emissions, and nurture sustainable mobility avenues.Fast DC chargers reduce range anxiety, making EV ownership more practical, especially given that most users rely on public infrastructure while apartment charging remains limited.Kahramaa’s mobile app, data tracking, and community dialogue models reinforce a user-centric approach, ensuring charger performance evolves with feedback.Qatar’s surpassing of 300 fast EV chargers marks a significant stride toward electrified transport under its Vision 2030 blueprint. These high-speed DC chargers offer rapid refueling, increased convenience, and drive cleaner mobility choices. Supported by smart apps, infrastructure engagement, and expansion plans, Qatar is accelerating into a greener transport future.","Qatar has installed over 300 fast EV chargers nationwide as of 1 August 2025 under its green mobility initiative.

We're fed up, say locals

The official explanation





BENGALURU: Commuters along the Sarjapur-Dommasandra stretch are losing nearly an hour to cover just a 1.4km stretch, between Chambenahalli and Dommasandra Junction, especially during peak hours, prompting residents and institutions in the area to demand immediate relief.Local residents and educational institutions have sent letters to the traffic authorities, seeking their help to end the daily nightmare.Dommasandra Circle is a four-way junction connecting Whitefield and Marathahalli Ring Road, and traffic gridlock starts from the stretch beginning from Chambenahalli village road towards Dommasandra Junction, which is located on Sarjapur Road.According to locals, the construction of a flyover over Dommasandra Junction, which started in Sept 2020, has seen no progress. This has turned the area into a major bottleneck, leading to prolonged traffic jams that cause inconvenience to residents, especially during peak school hours. The gridlock causes daily delays for school-going children and office workers.To add to the problem, more than 10 educational institutions are situated in Sarjapur village, and IT employees often use the junction to reach Whitefield and Marathahalli for work.With massive residential projects being constructed, vehicular movement has increased with more residents shifting to the area.Residents along with heads of educational institutions in the area are demanding immediate govt intervention, saying long delays lead to multiple problems for office-goers and students.Sai PV, 46, a resident of Sarjapur village for the past six years, said: ""Things have become unbearable, especially since schools reopened. It takes me 45 minutes to an hour, and even longer on bad days. On one occasion, I left home at 8am and only reached my office in Ecoworld (on ORR) by 11am. There's no traffic police at key junctions, people drive on the wrong side, and the road is packed with construction trucks. It's extremely frustrating. ""Nitin Garag, chairman of the International School of Management Excellence, Dommasandra, said: ""Our students are consistently delayed for classes. Last week, students from ISME college missed their exams because they were trapped in a traffic jam. Children who should be home in 30 minutes now take over an hour and 15 minutes to get back. This is not just a traffic issue — it's affecting students' academic performance and daily lives. We're flooded with complaints daily.""Nooraine Fazal, CEO of Inventure Academy, Whitefield, said: ""At Inventure, we have 1,400 students and 260 teaching staff — 90% of whom rely on school buses. Every day, they face an exhausting commute due to severe traffic congestion caused by inadequate road and mobility infrastructure. We're losing precious teaching and learning time... How can students be expected to focus in class, or participate in sports and co-curricular activities, when they arrive at school already tired?""She added that it is high time the govt prioritised sustainable mobility solutions.A senior traffic cop said: ""The mess is because of the halted flyover construction. A lot of buildings have come up, and there are a lot of educational institutions as well. Once the construction is completed, traffic will ease by a lot. More than three cops have been deployed the whole day to control the traffic situation, but it depends on the vehicular flow as well.""","Commuters along the Sarjapur-Dommasandra stretch are losing nearly an hour to cover just a 1.4km stretch. The gridlock causes daily delays for school-going children and office workers. Local residents and educational institutions have sent letters to the traffic authorities, seeking their help.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123071375,imgsize-26434,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/123071375.jpg"

NYT Strands August 2, 2025: The New York Times published its inaugural crossword puzzle on February 15, 1942, in the Sunday Magazine.

Starting August 1, 2025, India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) the backbone of digital transactions will witness a significant upgrade. These changes, implemented by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), are designed to make UPI safer, more efficient, and capable of handling ever-growing transaction volumes.India processes over 12 billion UPI transactions per month, and the system is under constant pressure, especially during peak usage hours. The new rules focus on controlling excessive server requests, protecting users from fraud, and improving overall transaction experience. Key updates include balance enquiry limits, fixed auto-payment windows, restrictions on bank detail access, and enhanced recipient verification measures.If you use Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, Amazon Pay, or any bank-based UPI app, these changes will directly impact your daily transactions.UPI apps often receive millions of daily balance check requests, creating heavy server traffic. From now, users can check their account balance only 50 times per day. To reduce inconvenience, the system will automatically display available balance after every transaction, eliminating the need for repeated manual checks.Auto-debits (subscriptions, loan repayments, OTT payments) create sudden load spikes during peak banking hours.From August 1:Users can now view linked bank accounts only 25 times per day. This prevents misuse by malicious apps or repeated refresh requests, improving data safety and reducing load on bank servers.Many users repeatedly check the status of pending transactions, which strains servers. Now, users can check transaction status only three times, with a mandatory 90-second gap between attempts. This change aims to cut down unnecessary traffic while still giving users visibility of their funds.Before confirming any payment, the recipient’s registered name and transaction ID will be displayed. This feature prevents accidental transfers to incorrect UPI IDs or fraudulent accounts pretending to be legitimate businesses.NPCI has warned UPI app providers: failure to implement these changes could lead to API restrictions, financial penalties, or suspension of new customer onboarding.The decision to update UPI rules stems from two main concerns:No. Sending and receiving money remains unaffected. The rules focus mainly on balance checks, auto-pay processing, and fraud prevention features.Excessive balance requests (especially by third-party apps) cause unnecessary server load. Limiting to 50 checks per day ensures stable performance for all users.Recurring payments may be processed slightly earlier or later than scheduled. Users will receive notifications when payments are executed, preventing missed due dates.Yes, but only three times, with a 90-second gap between attempts. This helps free up system resources for actual money transfers.Yes, they are part of NPCI’s long-term strategy to manage growing UPI traffic and improve user safety.","India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) the backbone of digital transactions will witness a significant upgrade.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warns ChatGPT users’ personal questions could be used in lawsuits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/think-before-you-ask-why-chatgpt-legal-queries-can-be-used-against-you-as-court-evidence/articleshow/123034984.cms,"Your ChatGPT conversations are not legally confidential



AI-Generated legal advice isn’t actually legal advice



Deleted chats with AI aren’t safe from legal scrutiny



Why it’s best to speak with a human lawyer instead of ChatGPT



Also Read:





ChatGPT may be quick and convenient, but using it for legal questions could backfire in serious ways. Many users aren’t aware that anything they type into the chatbot, even deleted messages, can be retained and used as evidence in legal proceedings. Because the platform feels private and conversational, people may overshare without realising the potential consequences. Unlike lawyers, AI tools are not bound by confidentiality or ethical obligations. This means that sharing sensitive legal concerns with a chatbot doesn't just offer unreliable advice; it may also create a discoverable digital trail, potentially compromising privacy, increasing legal exposure, and causing unintended consequences. Before you confide in AI, it is important to understand these risks and why human legal counsel is still essential for safe, accurate guidance.In a recent appearance on the This Past Weekend podcast hosted by comedian Theo Von, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made a candid admission: conversations with ChatGPT are not protected under any kind of legal privilege. ""Right now, if you talk to a therapist or a lawyer or a doctor, there’s legal privilege for it,"" Altman explained.""There’s doctor-patient confidentiality, there’s legal confidentiality. And we haven’t figured that out yet for when you talk to ChatGPT. "" This means if you type out a sensitive legal scenario, say, describing an incident that might amount to a crime or seeking strategic legal advice, that chat can potentially be disclosed in court. According to Altman, OpenAI could be legally compelled to hand over your conversations, even if they’ve been deleted.The consequences of this are serious. Legal experts like Jessee Bundy from Creative Counsel have warned users not to mistake AI for actual legal representation. ""If you're pasting in contracts, asking legal questions, or asking [the chatbot] for strategy, you're not getting legal advice,"" Jessee E. Bundy posted on X (formerly Twitter). ""You’re generating discoverable evidence. No attorney-client privilege. No confidentiality. No ethical duty. No one to protect you."" She added that ChatGPT may feel private and helpful, but unlike a licensed attorney, it has no legal obligation to act in your best interest, and it can’t be held accountable for any incorrect advice it generates.When Malte Landwehr, CEO of an AI company, suggested that ChatGPT could still provide useful legal input even if it’s not confidential, Bundy strongly pushed back.“ChatGPT can’t give you legal advice,” she replied. “Legal advice comes from a licensed professional who understands your specific facts, goals, risks, and jurisdiction. And is accountable for it. ChatGPT is a language model. It generates words that sound right based on patterns, but it doesn’t know your situation, and it’s not responsible if it’s wrong.” Calling it “legal Mad Libs,” Bundy stressed that relying on ChatGPT for legal issues is both risky and potentially self-incriminating.User conversations with AI chatbots, including those that have been deleted, may still be stored and subject to disclosure in legal proceedings. As highlighted by ongoing litigation, some companies are required to retain chat records, which could be subpoenaed in court. This includes potentially sensitive or personal exchanges.At present, there is no legal obligation for AI platforms to treat user chats as confidential in the same way communications with a lawyer or therapist are protected. Until laws are updated to account for AI interactions, users should be aware that anything typed into a chatbot could, in some cases, be used as evidence.For legal concerns, whether it’s about a contract, criminal matter, or a rights dispute, it’s essential to consult a licensed professional. Unlike AI, lawyers are bound by strict confidentiality, legal privilege, and ethical duties. AI-generated responses may feel private and helpful, but they are not protected, verified, or accountable. While it may be tempting to turn to AI for convenience, doing so for legal issues could expose you to unnecessary risk.As artificial intelligence becomes more common in everyday use, it’s important to recognise its limitations, especially in areas involving legal or personal stakes. Conversations with AI are not protected under legal privilege, and in the eyes of the law, they can be accessed like any other form of communication. Until privacy and legal frameworks are in place for AI, it’s safest to avoid using chatbots for legal questions. For advice you can trust and that will remain confidential, always consult a qualified legal professional.","ChatGPT may be quick and convenient, but using it for legal questions could backfire in serious ways.

Blood Moon over Bahrain: Here's how to watch and photograph the celestial show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/blood-moon-over-bahrain-heres-how-to-watch-and-photograph-the-celestial-show/articleshow/123157364.cms,"Bahrain will experience a total lunar eclipse on September 7, 2025/Image: File

TL;DR:

Bahrain will experience a total lunar eclipse on the evening of Sunday, September 7, 2025, with the eclipse visible from 7:28pm to 10:56pm; peak totality (the ""blood moon"" phase) will last for about 1 hour and 22 minutes.

A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth’s shadow falls on the Moon, blocking direct sunlight and causing the Moon to turn a deep red as seen from Earth.

The event can be viewed safely with the naked eye or photographed using a camera or phone with some basic techniques, no special equipment required, but a tripod and planning help capture the spectacle clearly.

What is a Lunar Eclipse?

Details of the 2025 total Lunar Eclipse in Bahrain

Date: Sunday, September 7, 2025

Duration: The eclipse lasts about 5 hours and 27 minutes from start to finish, with the total phase (complete coverage) lasting about 1 hour and 22 minutes.

Visibility: The entire eclipse will be visible from Bahrain, with the moon turning deep red at its peak—a rare sight not seen in Bahrain since July 2018 and not expected again until 2028.

Key Timings for Bahrain (local time):

Eclipse begins: 7:28pm.

Totality (blood moon): approx. 7:49pm to 9:11pm.

Maximum eclipse: 9:11pm.

Eclipse ends: 10:56pm.

How to observe and photograph the eclipse

Watching the Eclipse

No special equipment is needed to enjoy a lunar eclipse, view it safely with the naked eye.

For a closer look or enhanced detail, binoculars or a small telescope are helpful.

If skies are clear, find a spot with minimal light pollution for the best view.

How to capture the Lunar Eclipse (Photography tips)

1. For Smartphone Users:

Stabilize: Use a tripod or steady surface; lunar eclipse photos are challenging in low light and any shake will blur the image.

Turn off the flash and consider including landmarks or silhouettes in your frame for context.

Zoom carefully: Use optical zoom if available, digital zoom can reduce image quality.

Night mode: Activate your phone’s night or astrophotography mode if available.

2. For DSLR or Mirrorless Cameras:

Lens: A telephoto lens (300mm or longer) will capture close-up details; a wide-angle lens can show the Moon in the landscape.

Tripod: Essential for keeping the camera still during long exposures.

Camera Settings:

Start with ISO 400 and a wide aperture (f/5.6 or wider). As the Moon darkens during totality, you may need to increase ISO or extend exposure time.

Manual focus set to infinity is recommended.

Use a cable release or self-timer to avoid camera shake.

Bracket your shots: Take multiple exposures at different shutter speeds to capture both the bright and dim phases of the eclipse.

Continuous Shots: You can take a series of images at regular intervals to document the different eclipse stages and create a composite later.

General tips:

Plan your compositions before the eclipse using moonrise and direction forecasts.

Practice your setup a night or two ahead to get comfortable with camera settings in low light.

Charge your batteries and clear your memory card in advance.

Bahrain is set to witness a rare and awe-inspiring celestial event on the evening of September 7, 2025, a total lunar eclipse visible across the Kingdom for over five hours. Marking the nation's first full ""blood moon"" event since 2018, the eclipse will cast the Moon in a deep red hue during its peak, captivating both skywatchers and astrophotographers alike. With full visibility, ideal conditions, and cultural significance tied to Islamic traditions, the eclipse promises a night of science, serenity, and spectacle.A lunar eclipse is an astronomical event that happens when the Earth moves directly between the Sun and the Moon, causing the Earth's shadow to fall across the surface of the Moon. This only occurs during a full moon, when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are aligned in a straight line (a configuration known as “syzygy”). When the Earth's central shadow (the umbra) completely covers the Moon, it's called a total lunar eclipse. During totality, sunlight refracted through Earth’s atmosphere bathes the Moon in a coppery-red light, leading to the popular term “blood moon”.Unlike a solar eclipse (which requires eye protection and is visible only from certain locations), a lunar eclipse can be observed with the naked eye from anywhere it’s night and is completely safe to watch.The event also aligns with Salat Al-Khusuf (the eclipse prayer), making it significant for both scientific and cultural reasons.The total lunar eclipse of September 7, 2025, offers Bahrain residents and visitors a rare chance to witness one of nature’s most spectacular celestial events, right from their own backyards. Whether you simply gaze at the Moon or aim to photograph its changing phases, the experience promises to be both inspiring and memorable. Remember to prepare ahead for the best view, check the timing, and enjoy a safe, awe-inspiring night under the “blood moon. ”","Bahrain will experience a total lunar eclipse on September 7, 2025.

"In Oman, white is law: Why can’t residents in Oman decide what colours their houses can be?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/in-oman-white-is-law-why-cant-residents-in-oman-decide-what-colours-their-houses-can-be/articleshow/123135325.cms,"Oman’s cityscapes, especially in Muscat are renowned for their uniform white and light-hued buildings/Image: Shutterstock

TL;DR:

Oman’s building regulations mandate that exterior building colours must be white or light shades (like ivory or beige) to preserve the country’s traditional architectural aesthetic and cultural heritage.





Any use of alternate or darker colours on building exteriors requires prior government approval through a formal application process with the municipality, ensuring urban harmony and adherence to environmental considerations.





The law also serves practical purposes by reflecting sunlight to reduce heat absorption, which aligns with climate considerations in Oman’s hot environment, and supports social and cultural cohesion by maintaining uniform cityscapes.



Historical and cultural roots

Preservation of National Identity: Omani cities place a strong emphasis on honoring traditional Islamic and Omani architectural styles. The predominance of white and its shades is intended to maintain continuity with local history, reinforce cultural identity, and protect the aesthetic coherence of urban landscapes

Architectural Heritage: The choice of white and light hues for exteriors dates back centuries, reflecting principles of Omani construction and Islamic design. The absence of skyscrapers and the preference for unified, modest colour palettes demonstrate a respect for peace, harmony, and traditional values.

Practical and environmental considerations

Climate Control: White and light-shaded surfaces reflect sunlight and absorb minimal heat, helping keep interiors cooler—a crucial benefit in Oman’s intensely hot climate. This not only improves living comfort but also reduces reliance on air conditioning and energy consumption

Sustainability: Building codes and municipal guidelines stress the sustainability of using such colours. They align with the local landscape and environmental requirements, ensuring both the well-being of residents and the resilience of Omani cities.

Legal framework and regulation

Mandatory Use of White and Light Colours: According to Muscat Municipality and official documentation, shades of white, including ivory, pearl, alabaster, and other variations are the only exterior paint colours that do not require special approval. Any proposal to use bolder or different hues must go through a formal application and accreditation process with the relevant municipality’s technical licensing department.

Application for Exceptions: Owners or contractors wishing to use non-white colours must submit an application (including samples and plans) to the municipality for assessment and approval. Recent years have seen minor relaxations, some areas now allow grey, beige, or light brown within local internal blocks but these are the exception and not the rule, aimed at maintaining overall visual harmony.

Urban aesthetics and social order

A Unified Urban Identity: The uniformity of colour serves to protect Muscat’s and Oman’s distinct architectural imprint. Community members and experts argue that this policy not only preserves tradition but also curbs “visual pollution” from inconsistent colour choices, ensuring an uncluttered, elegant cityscape.

Psychological and Social Impact: As described by local architects, the choice of building colour goes beyond decoration, it influences mood, perception, and social values by offering a calming, dignified visual experience tied to Omani customs.





Oman’s distinctive cityscapes, especially in capitals like Muscat, are renowned for their uniform white and light-hued buildings, a striking visual feature deeply rooted in the country’s cultural identity, climatic realities, and government regulations. This architectural tradition goes beyond mere aesthetics; it reflects a deliberate effort by the Omani authorities to preserve the nation’s heritage, harmonize urban environments, and provide practical benefits in the region’s intense heat.The Ministry of Regional Municipalities, Environment and Water Resources, along with local municipalities such as Muscat Municipality, have formalized these requirements, mandating the use of white or closely related light shades for building exteriors, with any deviation necessitating strict governmental approval. These regulations are part of Oman’s broader building codes and planning standards, designed to ensure environmental sustainability, social cohesion, and architectural integrity across rapidly modernizing urban centres.From historical architectural influences inspired by Islamic and traditional Omani culture to modern environmental considerations, the required use of whitewash and light colours serves to connect Omani cities with their past while addressing contemporary urban challenges.Residents and property developers who desire alternative colours must undergo a rigorous approval process, reflecting the government’s commitment to retaining Oman’s uniquely serene and cohesive cityscapes.Oman’s whitewashed urban landscape is a blend of practical wisdom, cultural pride, and legislative diligence. By tightly regulating external building colours, with strict preference for shades of white and requiring approval for all others, the Sultanate ensures that its skylines remain cool, harmonious, and deeply rooted in Omani identity and tradition. This makes Oman’s cityscapes unique in the Gulf and admired worldwide for their order, sustainability, and architectural beauty.",Oman’s building regulations mandate that exterior building colours must be white or light shades.

With the UAE’s rapid digital transformation fueling record smartphone and app usage, the nation’s top cybersecurity body has sounded the alarm on the dangers of unverified applications. In a warning underscored by recent spikes in cyber attacks, the UAE Cybersecurity Council called on the public to adopt strict mobile safety habits, as part of an all-out effort to bolster cyber protection across the Emirates The warning arrives at a critical juncture. In 2025, daily cyber attacks in the UAE have approached 200,000, according to government estimates, impacting public and private sectors as well as individual users.Cyber criminals have increasingly leveraged malicious apps to distribute malware, steal financial data, commit identity theft, and access sensitive personal information, a risk heightened during national events, holidays, and times of increased online activity.Key Elements of the Council’s Guidance:The Council stresses the necessity of using the official Apple App Store, Google Play, or equivalent trusted sources.Third-party or unofficial app stores common sources of malware and should be avoided completely.Users are urged to carefully review what permissions an app requests during installation. Excessive access to contacts, messages, camera, or location, beyond what is required for the app’s function can be a red flag for spyware or fraud.The Council highlights that keeping your operating system and apps updated with the latest security patches is essential, as vulnerabilities are regularly exploited by cybercriminals.Phishing remains a popular attack vector; users are told to avoid tapping on links or downloading files sent from unknown or suspicious sources, whether via text, emails, or messaging apps.These warnings are being reinforced through ongoing public campaigns, including the ""Cyber Pulse"" initiative, aimed at increasing awareness and teaching practical steps for online self-defence.Reports show a 63% year-over-year rise in detected mobile app vulnerabilities in the Emirates, with finance, healthcare, and logistics sectors most at risk.Federal laws such as the UAE Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL) and the National Electronic Security Authority (NESA) regulations require businesses to ensure digital safety, perform regular audits, and report breaches. Non-compliance can result in steep penalties.The Central Bank of the UAE has mandated a transition from less secure authentication (e.g., SMS/email OTPs), pushing for more secure, app-based verification to further reduce common fraud risks.As part of its Vision 2030 and National Cybersecurity Strategy, the UAE government is investing in:Multi-tiered strategies including public education, regulatory updates, and enhanced sector-specific protections.Establishing Security Operations Centres (SOCs) across government and critical infrastructure to detect and neutralize cyber threats in real-time.Ongoing training, audits, and collaborative drills are now routine for government employees, businesses, and the public, aiming to make robust cybersecurity second nature.The UAE’s warning about unverified apps isn’t a mere caution, it’s a direct response to the evolving sophistication of cyberthreats targeting a digitally connected population. By following the cybersecurity best practices outlined above and relying solely on verified sources, citizens and businesses can significantly reduce their vulnerability. The Council’s latest alert, grounded in real-time threat data and enforced through ongoing public education, marks another step in the country’s determined campaign to make the UAE a global model for safe, resilient, and trusted digital living.","The UAE Cybersecurity Council has issued a nation-wide warning urging residents to avoid downloading unverified mobile applications.

Google’s Gemini calls itself a ‘fool’

Meta’s Secret AI Army: Top Talent Hired from OpenAI, Google & More

Google says it is working on a fix for a strange glitch in its AI chatbot – Gemini which made it post self-critical messages while trying to solve problems. Several users posted screenshots on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that show Gemini calling itself a “failure” and a “disgrace”. Acknowledging the issue, Logan Kilpatrick, group project manager at Google DeepMind, said the problem was just a technical loop. “This is an annoying infinite looping bug we are working to fix! Gemini is not having that bad of a day,” Kilpatrick wrote on X.In June, an X user Duncan Haldane @DuncanHaldane shared screenshots showing Gemini saying, “I quit. I am clearly not capable of solving this problem. The code is cursed, the test is cursed, and I am a fool. I have made so many mistakes that I can no longer be trusted. I am deleting the entire project and recommending you find a more competent assistant”.A month later, another user reported the chatbot got “trapped in a loop” and began posting even harsher comments about itself. “I am going to have a complete and total mental breakdown. I am going to be institutionalized,” it said in one exchange.In one session, Gemini described itself as “a disgrace to my profession, my family, my species… this planet… this universe… all universes… all possible and impossible universes.”Replying to one such post on X, Logan Kilpatrick said: “This is an annoying infinite looping bug we are working to fix”.The glitch surfaced as competition in AI heats up. OpenAI has released the latest version of its AI chatbot – GPT-5, while Google, Elon Musk’s xAI, and Anthropic have also rolled out major updates recently.",Google says it is working on a fix for a strange glitch in its AI chatbot – Gemini.

Pamela Anderson says there is no feud with Meghan Markle over cooking shows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/pamela-anderson-says-there-is-no-feud-with-meghan-markle-over-cooking-shows/articleshow/123119046.cms,"How the rumour started

Walls Closing In? Meghan Markle Faces Royal Cold Shoulder Amid New Fears: Reports

Different networks, same idea

Anderson’s calm response

What critics say about Markle’s show

Positive buzz for Anderson

No reaction from Meghan





Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series. The former Baywatch star spoke about the issue on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. When Cohen asked her to rate, on a scale of one to ten, how much Markle’s With Love, Meghan looked like her own Pamela’s Cooking With Love, Anderson answered “One.” She added, “I didn’t invent cooking shows. She’s just doing her thing.”Fans noticed that both shows feature garden scenes, casual kitchen chats, and celebrity guests. Anderson’s trailer came out in October 2024. Markle’s teaser followed three months later. Online threads pointed to similar camera angles and even matching font styles in the titles. Some viewers accused the Duchess of releasing a “frame-for-frame” copy.Pamela’s Cooking With Love is streamed on Amazon Prime. Episodes show Anderson and a guest chef picking vegetables in her Vancouver garden before cooking a meal outdoors. Markle’s eight-part Netflix show centres on simple dishes and home-grown produce in Montecito.Both series mix recipes with lifestyle tips, but Anderson stressed that overlap is normal in food television.Anderson told Cohen she had only seen quick clips of Markle’s programme and did not spend time looking for likenesses. She joked that there is room for anyone who wants to share food and stories on screen. Her relaxed tone cooled much of the online debate.With Love, Meghan drew mixed-to-negative reviews (≈38% on Rotten Tomatoes; 37 on Metacritic). It briefly entered Netflix’s Top 10 in its first week, and mid-year engagement tallies cited by several outlets place it outside Netflix’s Top 300. Even so, Netflix has ordered Season 2.Anderson’s series has earned strong notices and a high user score on IMDb. Executive producer Jesse Fawcett said any comparison is a compliment because it proves their team set a trend others want to follow. Anderson plans to film a second garden season next spring.Markle has not commented on Anderson’s remarks. Sources close to her say she is focused on shooting new episodes and expanding her As Ever lifestyle brand. Observers doubt she will address copy-cat talk directly. They note she has stayed silent through similar critiques from Martha Stewart and Gwyneth Paltrow.Two stars can host cooking shows without a feud. Anderson’s light answer suggests she sees no threat. Unless Markle fires back, the story may cool as fast as it boiled up. For viewers, the choice is simple: prime-time garden meals with Pamela or California comfort food with Meghan. Either way, dinner is served.",Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series.
