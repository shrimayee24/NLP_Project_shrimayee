Understanding AC condensate water

What is AC condensate water?

Is condensate water pure?

Dust and dirt on the coils

Algae or mold in the drainage system

Metal traces from corroded components (aluminum, copper)

Air pollutants like volatile organic compounds (VOCs)

Why do inverter batteries need distilled water?

With rising temperatures and increasing dependence on air conditioners, many households and businesses are noticing a side effect of cooling‚Äîthe consistent dripping of water from AC discharge pipes. This water, known as condensate water, is the byproduct of the air conditioning process where moisture from humid air condenses on the evaporator coils and is expelled through a drain pipe. Given its clean appearance, many people wonder: can this water be reused‚Äîparticularly for inverter batteries that require distilled water for maintenance?In a time of growing water scarcity and rising electricity needs, especially in tropical regions, reusing resources like condensate water seems like an eco-conscious choice. However, using AC condensate water in inverter batteries is not a straightforward decision. There are technical, chemical, and practical factors to consider.Air conditioners cool air by passing it over cold evaporator coils. As warm, moist air hits these coils, moisture condenses into water‚Äîmuch like how water forms on a cold glass on a humid day. This condensed moisture then collects in a tray and is discharged through a drain line.While condensate water originates from atmospheric moisture, it is not guaranteed to be chemically pure. Factors affecting its purity include:Therefore, although it may appear clear, AC discharge water can contain impurities, including bacteria and metal ions.Most lead-acid inverter batteries rely on electrolyte levels (a mix of sulfuric acid and water) to function correctly. Over time, water in the electrolyte evaporates, and users need to refill it periodically.Distilled water is used because it is:Using anything other than distilled water can damage the battery plates, reduce its lifespan, and even cause dangerous chemical reactions.At first glance, AC condensate water may seem like a good substitute for distilled water because:However, scientific and engineering experts warn against its direct use for several reasons.Even though it comes from air, condensate water can absorb:These contaminants can interfere with the chemical reaction inside a battery, leading to:Stagnant water in drain pipes can breed algae, bacteria, and mold, which may introduce biological contaminants into the battery.This can:Condensate water may have a slightly acidic or alkaline pH, depending on environmental factors. This imbalance can disrupt the electrochemical stability of the battery electrolyte.Distilled water sold for battery use is subject to stringent quality controls. AC discharge water, however, is not regulated, tested, or certified for battery use.If you‚Äôre interested in using AC water for other purposes, here are recommended safe uses:If you‚Äôre adamant about using it for batteries, it must be:Even then, results are not guaranteed, and risk remains high without lab-grade testing.","Air conditioners cool air by passing it over cold evaporator coils.

LinkedIn lays off hundreds of employees across California: Engineers and others affected



iPhone 16e: 5 Reasons to buy the most affordable iPhone 16 series model!

LinkedIn is laying off 281 employees across California, impacting engineers and other units, a report claims. The Microsoft-owned professional networking platform has notified affected workers earlier, a WARN document filed with local officials claims. The job cuts are reportedly distributed across several locations: 159 positions in Mountain View, 60 in San Francisco, 23 in Sunnyvale, 11 in Carpinteria, and 28 remote workers based in California. These layoffs seem to be a part of a larger wave of job reductions at parent company Microsoft. Earlier this month, it was reported that 122 Bay Area Microsoft employees were laid off as part of an estimated 6,000-employee cut across the tech giant. In April, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also stated that artificial intelligence (AI) was responsible for writing up to 30% of the company's code, which may be the reason behind these job cuts.According to the WARN filing (seen by SF Gate), LinkedIn has laid off a significant number of software engineers. In Mountain View alone, 71 positions across three broad categories of software engineers, including those with ‚Äústaff‚Äù and ‚Äúsenior‚Äù in their titles, are being eliminated.This count doesn‚Äôt include additional specialists in areas like machine learning, DevOps, and systems infrastructure, some of whom are also affected, the report notes. The filing further lists roles such as deal desk strategists, product managers, designers, and various other professionals among those impacted.However, the report didn‚Äôt reveal details about the full extent of the layoffs announced by the company, which is headquartered on the border of Sunnyvale and Mountain View with several other offices worldwide.LinkedIn and its parent company, Microsoft, have yet to respond to inquiries regarding the reasons behind the job cuts, details about severance packages, or whether more layoffs are anticipated.In 2023, when the company laid off 716 employees, LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky addressed the decision in a publicly shared email. So far, no such communication has been released this time. Meanwhile, LinkedIn‚Äôs ‚ÄúAbout Us‚Äù page states that the company employs both 18,400 people and more than 18,500 full-time employees.","LinkedIn is laying off 281 employees across California, a report claims.

The 25-year quest to find Miss Atomic Bomb ends.

A city built on 'nuclear tourism'

The start of the quest

Who was Anna Lee Mahoney?

More than just a photograph





For 25 years, one question consumed retired scientist Robert Friedrichs: Who was the woman behind the most famous photograph in Las Vegas‚Äô history?The mysterious showgirl captured in a 1957 promotional photograph became an enduring symbol of atomic-age America. Posed in a mushroom cloud-shaped swimsuit with arms outstretched against the Nevada desert, she was known only by her stage name ""Lee A. Merlin‚Äù.The iconic photograph emerged from a unique moment in American history when the display of nuclear power captured public attention between 1951 and 1992.Las Vegas sought to capitalise on the trend, and sent in a photographer in 1957 to shoot a promotional ad for ‚Äònuclear tourism‚Äô. Nuclear tourism refers to travel focused on atomic history, where visitors explore nuclear test sites, reactors, and related museums to experience and learn about the Atomic age.The photographer shot the model in a fluffy, mushroom-shaped swimsuit, immitating a nuclear cloud, in high-heels and a smiling face, strectching her arms as the desert unfolded behind her.It became one of the most requested photographs, shaping Las Vegas' identity as a city of fantasy and spectacle.Yet little was known about the model in th photo.Friedrichs in 2000 started his quest for the lady when the Atomic Museum was preparing to open in Las Vegas. As a founding member, he hoped to locate Miss Atomic Bomb for the grand opening ceremony. What started as simple curiosity evolved into an all-consuming obsession.His investigation filled stacks of binders with clues and potential leads. He tracked down the original photographer, Don English, and interviewed former showgirls who confirmed the stage name ""Lee A. Merlin."" But the woman's true identity remained elusive, with leads drying up and months turning into years.The breakthrough came unexpectedly last winter. After Friedrichs delivered a presentation about his search at the Atomic Museum, an audience member sent him an obituary the following day. One detail jumped out: the deceased woman had once been the lead dancer at the Sands Hotel.Her name was Anna Lee Mahoney.Born on August 14, 1927, in the Bronx, Mahoney was trained in ballet in New York before transitioning to stage performances under her professional name, ‚ÄòLee A. Merlin‚Äô. By 1957, she had become the lead dancer at the famous Sands Hotel in Las Vegas.After retiring from dance, Mahoney reinvented herself as a mental health counselor, working in the field for 30 years.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‚Äòultimate beneficiary name‚Äô, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API ‚Äì the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.‚ÄúThis change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,‚Äù NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. ‚ÄúThis step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,‚Äù said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store‚Äôs brand name or any custom label.‚ÄúThis will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,‚Äù said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, ‚ÄúIt helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.‚ÄùBy standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‚Äòultimate beneficiary name‚Äô The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here‚Äôs a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Whether you are a first-time player or on a winning streak, this guide will walk you through how to play, hints for today‚Äôs groups, the correct answers and their connections.NYT Connections is a daily word puzzle game offered by The New York Times . It presents players with a 4x4 grid of 16 seemingly unrelated words. The goal is to organise them into four groups of four words that are connected by a common theme or idea. These themes can range from synonyms and item categories to clever wordplay and pop culture references. The game tests not just vocabulary, but lateral thinking as well.Playing Connections is simple but tricky. You start with a grid of 16 words. Your task is to group the words into four sets of four that share a common link. These links can be literal, metaphorical, or based on word associations. Once you select a group of four words, hit the 'Submit' button. If correct, that group is removed from the board. You only get four chances to make mistakes, so choose wisely. The four categories are colour-coded by difficulty: yellow (easiest), green, blue, and purple (hardest).To help you solve today‚Äôs puzzle, here are the theme hints for each of the four groups:Yellow group ‚Äì Rods: BAT, CLUB, STAFF, STICKGreen group ‚Äì They‚Äôre on a roll!: FOIL, RIBBON, TAPE, TOILET PAPERBlue group ‚Äì Common swag items: HAT, TEE, TOTE, WATER BOTTLEPurple group ‚Äì Words before ""shack"": CADDY, LOVE, RADIO, SHAKEThe yellow group contains items that are types of rods or handheld sticks, such as a bat for baseball or a staff often used in hiking or fantasy tales.The green group are all objects that are typically rolled up. Toilet paper, foil, ribbon, and tape are all stored and dispensed from rolls, making the connection logical and physical.The blue group includes popular promotional items. If you've attended any conference or corporate event, you‚Äôve likely come home with a hat, tee, tote bag, or water bottle emblazoned with a company logo.The purple group is a fun wordplay category. Each word can be paired with ‚Äúshack‚Äù to form a well-known term or brand: Caddyshack (film), Love Shack (song by The B-52‚Äôs), RadioShack (retail chain), and Shake Shack (restaurant chain).Today‚Äôs puzzle was a satisfying mix of straightforward connections and clever wordplay. The trickiest part was arguably the purple group, but once ‚ÄúRadio‚Äù and ‚ÄúShake‚Äù were spotted, the pattern clicked into place. Whether you solved it quickly or needed some nudges, remember each day brings a new challenge. Come back tomorrow for another round of mental gymnastics. Happy Connection!",NYT Connections is a daily word puzzle game offered by The New York Times. It presents players with a 4x4 grid of 16 seemingly unrelated words.

Data breach victims skyrocket 312% in 2024: What you need to know

Data breach warning: Essential security tips every American needs today

1. Change your passwords ‚Äî All of them

Use unique passwords for every account.

Make them long, complex, and include numbers, symbols, and both upper and lower case letters.

Avoid reusing passwords or slight variations across websites.

2. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)

Always turn on two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication for important accounts, especially banking, email, and social media.

3. Freeze your credit

Contact the three major credit bureaus ‚Äî Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion ‚Äî to freeze your credit. This will prevent new accounts from being opened in your name and doesn‚Äôt affect your credit score.

4. Check if your info was compromised

Use tools like Google‚Äôs Password Checkup or HaveIBeenPwned.com to verify whether your login credentials have been leaked in known data dumps.

5. Update contact information

Ensure your email addresses and phone numbers linked to bank accounts and e-commerce profiles are current. This ensures you receive alerts in case of suspicious activity.

6. Set up transaction alerts

Most banks and credit cards allow you to receive real-time alerts for every transaction. This makes it easier to spot fraud early.

In one of the most alarming cybersecurity revelations of the decade, a massive data leak has exposed over 184 million records, including emails, passwords, and login links ‚Äî all stored in plain text ‚Äî according to a new report by Wired. The shocking discovery was made by cybersecurity expert Jeremiah Fowler, who found the unprotected database freely accessible online. Unlike other breaches that require decryption or advanced hacking to exploit, this leak is disturbingly simple to misuse. Fowler described it as a ""cybercriminal‚Äôs dream working list"", highlighting the ease with which threat actors can now gain direct access to accounts tied to major companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and even banks and government agencies.As cyberattacks evolve and cloud storage becomes more prevalent, this breach signals a growing vulnerability in the digital lives of millions of Americans. The consequences include identity theft , financial fraud, and account takeovers, unless urgent action is taken. Here's everything you need to know about the breach, why it‚Äôs different from previous ones, and what steps you should take today to protect yourself.According to Fowler‚Äôs report, the database contained:These details were exposed without any authentication protection and were accessible by anyone with a web browser. What makes this breach uniquely dangerous is that login links can often bypass traditional username and password entries, giving hackers one-click access to user accounts.Although the database itself wasn‚Äôt tied to a specific company, cross-referenced data revealed leaked credentials linked to:The presence of login links for services with sensitive financial, personal, and professional data is a glaring red flag.Many past breaches involved hashed or encrypted passwords, making them harder to exploit. This one, however, included fully readable login credentials, making it immediately usable by cybercriminals . Worse still, login URLs in the dataset could allow attackers to bypass security protocols altogether.Jeremiah Fowler noted that this was not a theoretical threat but a practical toolkit for fraudsters. The plain-text nature of the data drastically reduces the technical skill required to launch credential stuffing attacks, identity fraud, and phishing campaigns.The rise in such breaches has been directly tied to the explosion of cloud services like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. These platforms offer cost efficiency and scalability, but they also create centralized attack surfaces.An IBM report cited by The Wall Street Journal revealed that 82% of breaches in the past year involved data stored on the cloud, with misconfigured servers and public storage buckets often being the weak link.The problem is escalating. In 2023, the number of data breaches rose by 72%, affecting over 353 million people, according to cybersecurity analysts. But 2024 has seen an even more disturbing trend: while the number of breaches remained high, the number of individuals affected skyrocketed by 312% ‚Äî largely due to mega-breaches like this one.Adding to the concern is a recent case involving Coinbase, the crypto exchange giant. On May 11, 2024, support agents based overseas were allegedly bribed by hackers to gain access to customer data. Although Coinbase refused to pay ransom, the breach could result in damages exceeding $400 million, highlighting how human vulnerabilities compound technical flaws.In the face of this breach, experts urge Americans to take immediate steps to secure their digital identities. Here are critical actions recommended by cybersecurity professionals and financial watchdogs:","A massive data leak has exposed over 184 million records, including emails, passwords, and login links ‚Äî all stored in plain text.

Government seeks unprecedented AI restrictions

Market shifts signal competitive pressure



A federal judge sharply challenged Google 's arguments against proposed antitrust remedies during closing arguments Friday, questioning the tech giant's stance on restrictions that could limit its artificial intelligence ambitions and search dominance.U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta pushed back against Google lawyer John Schmidtlein's claims that the Justice Department hadn't proven sufficient causation for drastic remedies. ""They are telling you that you don't need any causal connection to do any of these remedies,"" Schmidtlein argued. ""That is wrong."" The judge's pointed questioning suggested skepticism toward Google's defense strategy.The Justice Department has proposed sweeping remedies including forcing Google to sell its Chrome browser, ending its $20 billion annual payments to Apple for default search placement, and crucially, restricting Google's ability to promote its Gemini AI product . ""The reason we are so focused on Gen AI is because that is the new search access point,"" Justice Department lawyer David Dahlquist explained, positioning AI as the future battleground for search dominance.The government's case centers on preventing Google from monopolizing next-generation search through AI, pointing to testimony that Google now pays Samsung and Motorola to pre-install Gemini on devices. This mirrors the exclusive deals that helped maintain Google's roughly 90% search market share.The urgency surrounding AI became apparent when Apple executives testified that Google searches in Safari had declined for the first time in two decades, while Apple plans to offer AI options like ChatGPT within the next year. Alphabet shares fell sharply following this revelation, though Google disputed the claims.Judge Mehta questioned whether AI companies that don't build traditional search engines should access Google's valuable data under proposed remedies. He also floated making payment bans contingent on other remedies failing and asked whether forcing Chrome's sale might be ""cleaner and more elegant"" than alternatives.The judge expects to rule in August, with Google planning to appeal regardless of the outcome.",Judge Amit Mehta questioned Google's arguments against proposed remedies.

How Amazon and Microsoft are thriving in this space while Apple is not

How this may be a risk to Apple

While tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are advancing rapidly in the AI sector, Apple is reportedly at a disadvantage. Despite its efforts to push forward with AI initiatives, the iPhone maker lacks the essential infrastructure and long-term investment in core AI technologies that its competitors have spent years, if not decades, developing, a new report indicates.For example, Apple delayed its planned overhaul of Siri earlier this year because the upgrade, meant to usher Siri into the generative AI era, wasn‚Äôt ready. According to a report by Business Insider, if Apple wants to modernise Siri to its competitors' levels, it may need to build critical AI components from scratch‚Äîan expensive, time-consuming process that could take years. Otherwise, it may be forced to rely more heavily on competitors or acquire startups at scale to catch up.For having a successful AI product, one needs to have certain AI building blocks. Google already has nearly all the core AI building blocks in place, while Microsoft and Amazon have some of them. Google controls the deep stack of technologies powering its AI building blocks -- data, chips, data centres, cloud business and means to disseminate the products -- which is why it is able to launch AI consumer tools like Veo, Flow, Imagen and so on.In 2017, Google invented Transformer, the breakthrough architecture behind modern generative AI. Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Google's AI chips, have been around since 2016 and are now integral to both Google products and external developers using Google Cloud.Google also benefits from decades of web indexing and data collection. This immense dataset supports the training of its powerful AI models, datacenters and a cloud business to make these tools available to customers.Both Microsoft and Amazon have some of these building blocks, including AI models, cloud infrastructure, dedicated AI units working on the technology and even partnerships. Apple, on the other hand, lacks many of these assets and doesn't have this kind of access or infrastructure.Apple still doesn't operate enough large-scale data centres and relies on Google data centres for functions like iCloud backups. For recent AI training, Apple even requested access to Google‚Äôs TPUs‚Äîessentially borrowing infrastructure from a direct rival.Reportedly, Apple is also about 7 years behind Google in developing AI chips for data centers. When it comes to data, though Apple has access to huge volumes of data from its devices, it has been conservative in using that data for AI training due to its privacy-first policies. This restricts its ability to build and refine large-scale models.The report also said that Apple has also lagged in recruiting and retaining top AI talent.If generative AI ends up reshaping how people interact with computing devices, including smartphones and laptops, Apple‚Äôs delayed investment in AI infrastructure could become a critical problem. While other tech giants are rolling out robust, end-to-end AI systems, Apple is still piecing together the basic components.","Apple lacks the infrastructure and long-term investment in core AI technologies that its competitors have spent years, if not decades, developing.
