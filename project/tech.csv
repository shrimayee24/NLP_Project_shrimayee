Investigators: 80 CCTV dashboards compromised

AHMEDABAD: A single default password - ""admin123"" - was all it took to unlock a national nightmare. What began at Payal Maternity Hospital in Rajkot as a case of careless digital housekeeping spiralled into one of India's most disturbing cyber scandals. Hackers breached the hospital's CCTV system through its default admin login, stole hours of intimate footage of women being examined in the gynaecology ward, and fed it into an international porn fetish network for profit.The access logs spanned nearly a year, from Jan 2024 through early Dec 2024, until the perpetrators were arrested this Feb. The hackers were able to steal at least 50,000 clips over nine months from across the country.The scam came to light after teaser clips from the Rajkot facility were posted online on YouTube channels like ""Megha Mbbs"" and ""cp monda"". Customers were led to Telegram groups to buy the footage, for anything between Rs 700 and Rs 4,000. Investigators found about ""80 CCTV dashboards compromised nationwide, including in Pune, Mumbai, Nashik, Surat, Ahmedabad, and Delhi"". The victims ranged across 20 states, spanning hospitals, schools, corporate houses, cinema halls, factories, and even private residences.Despite the primary arrests being made earlier in 2025, investigators found that these illegally obtained clips were still available on Telegram groups until at least June.Investigators found that many of these CCTV systems still used factory-set passwords like ""admin123"".An Ahmedabad cybercrime branch officer told TOI: ""The primary method used was a 'brute force attack' (hackers using a program or bot to try every possible combination of letters and numbers for a lock).""Parit Dhameliya, the lead hacker in the operation, a BCom graduate, employed three different software programs to achieve this. With stolen credentials, another accused, Rohit Sisodiya - who was later arrested in Delhi and used a diploma in medical laboratory technology as a cover - used a tool meant for legitimate remote viewing to input stolen login details and gain unauthorised access to the hospital's cameras.","A single default password - ""admin123"" - was all it took to unlock a national nightmare.

UAE telecom operator Du jumps into bitcoin mining

What does Cloud Miner offer?

Step-by-step: Subscribing to Cloud Miner

Step 1: Get Ready to Bid the initial contracts are made available through an online auction hosted at the designated platform. You must be a UAE resident with a verified ID to participate.

Step 2: Participate in the Auction Bidding for the limited-capacity 24-month contracts runs for a specified period (The initial window was November 3 to 9). You will need to secure a contract through this process to gain access to the service.

Step 3: Account Verification (KYC/AML) To ensure regulatory compliance and security, du requires a strict verification process for all high-value transactions:

UAE Pass: Access to the platform requires verification through your official UAE Pass digital identity. This ensures adherence to local Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Mandatory 2FA is required for all account access, bolstering your security.

Step 4: Commence Mining Once your subscription is secured, your account is verified, and the fixed fees are paid, your cloud mining operation begins immediately from du's secure data centers in the UAE. You receive Bitcoin rewards based on the rented computational power.

What residents should weigh before signing up?

Costs vs rewards: Cloud mining reduces setup costs but fees, uptime, and pool efficiency affect returns read the fee and payout formulas closely.



Payout mechanics: Payouts are reported to be in Bitcoin and routed to users’ wallets ensure you have a compatible wallet and understand tax/reporting requirements in your emirate.

Contract terms & refunds: Check contract length, maintenance fees, and what happens if network difficulty rises or BTC price changes.

Security & trust: Using a large incumbent (du) gives more operational transparency than anonymous cloud-mining sites, but always verify service terms and regulatory disclosures.

Why is this interesting?





Want to mine Bitcoin without the drama of hardware, heat or high bills? UAE residents can now click, subscribe and start earning BTC - no tech skills needed. Du 's new Cloud Miner service, the UAE's first official Cloud Mining as a Service (MaaS) offering from a telecom company, has made Bitcoin mining accessible and compliant for residents.This guide breaks down exactly what the service is, how to get started, and the key benefits of this regulated opportunity.MaaS stands for Mining as a Service. It's a business model that dramatically simplifies the process of cryptocurrency mining, particularly for digital assets like Bitcoin.In a MaaS model, a provider (like Du, with its Cloud Miner) owns and operates all the necessary, specialized mining hardware. They maintain the equipment, manage the high electricity consumption, and ensure the entire operation remains compliant and connected to the blockchain. Essentially, Cloud Miner allows UAE residents to participate in Bitcoin mining by simply subscribing to the output of a professional mining operation, making it an easy-to-digest investment product rather than a technical endeavor.The digital finance landscape in the UAE just got a major upgrade.Telecom giant Du has officially launched a new, revolutionary platform called Cloud Miner, offering residents a straightforward way to participate in the booming world of Bitcoin mining. Revealed on November 2, 2025, during a high-profile launch event at the Burj Khalifa, this service marks a massive first: it is the initial official Cloud Mining as a Service (MaaS) offering from a UAE company.Cloud Miner is a “mining-as-a-service” product under du’s du Tech arm. Each contract sells a fixed amount of hashing power (plans start at 250 terahashes per second (TH/s)), and the mining results are paid out directly in Bitcoin to users’ crypto wallets. du runs the hardware, handles electricity and technical management, and shares the mined Bitcoin with subscribers according to the capacity they hold. This removes the need for users to buy ASIC rigs, arrange power, or manage complex cooling and maintenance.This move is exclusive to UAE residents and instantly expands the digital options available to those looking to grow their investment portfolio within a fully transparent and locally compliant framework. It aligns perfectly with the country’s push to develop robust digital asset and blockchain infrastructure.The initial phase of securing a Cloud Miner contract is done through a specific online process, designed for UAE residents only.A mainstream telecom company offering cloud mining services lowers the entry barrier for ordinary UAE residents and signals the UAE’s continued push to integrate digital-asset services into mainstream infrastructure, while also highlighting the need to strictly follow local rules about where mining can physically operate.","Telecom giant Du has officially launched a new, revolutionary platform called Cloud Miner.

Understanding Shingles

Two-Dose Shingrix schedule and coverage

Abu Dhabi Citizens: Eligible citizens holding a Thiqa card can receive the vaccine free of charge at authorized healthcare facilities.

Insured Residents: While not fully subsidized in all emirates, leading health insurers like Daman have recently expanded their coverage to include the Shingrix vaccine under their DHA Compliant Enhanced schemes, making it more accessible to residents with premium policies.





If you’re 50 or older in the UAE, there’s a new health reminder to add to your checklist: the shingles vaccine is now available to help protect you from the painful rash and nerve-related complications caused when the chickenpox virus resurfaces later in life.In a major step to strengthen public health, the UAE's Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP) officially announced the inclusion of the Herpes Zoster vaccine—known commercially as Shingrix—into the national adult vaccination programme. This initiative ensures protection against the highly painful viral infection known as Shingles. The vaccine is now easily accessible at health facilities across all seven emirates. The primary target group for this vital preventive measure includes all UAE residents aged 50 years and older. However, those aged 18 and above who have a weakened immune system due to medical conditions or therapy are also strongly advised to get vaccinated, reflecting a robust, proactive approach to health.Shingles, or herpes zoster, is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, the very same virus responsible for chickenpox.After a person recovers from chickenpox, the virus remains dormant within the nerve tissue and can reactivate years later, often as the immune system naturally weakens with age. The condition typically manifests as a painful skin rash and blisters that emerge on one side of the body. The pain is often described as burning or stabbing. Crucially, Shingles can lead to severe, long-lasting complications, most notably Postherpetic Neuralgia (PHN), a form of chronic nerve pain that can persist for months or even years after the rash has cleared, significantly impacting the quality of life. The vaccine is recommended even for individuals who have previously experienced a Shingles outbreak.The Shingrix vaccine is administered as a two-dose series, maximizing its effectiveness. The second dose is typically scheduled to be received two to six months after the first. Health officials are dedicated to raising public awareness about the importance of adhering to this full two-dose schedule for maximum protection.Regarding cost, coverage varies by emirate and policy:The UAE’s nationwide shingles vaccination rollout reinforces the growing importance of adult immunisation as a core pillar of long-term public health. By proactively prioritising prevention for those most at risk, the country aims to significantly reduce severe cases and improve the overall quality of life for older adults. Individuals aged 50 and above are strongly encouraged to consult their healthcare provider and take timely vaccination to ensure complete and sustained protection.","UAE launches national adult vaccination drive for ages 50+.

Strengthening Dubai’s parking infrastructure









As Dubai’s commercial districts continue to expand, its streets are adapting. Parkin PJSC, the emirate’s largest public parking operator, has added paid parking zones in Dubai Studio City and Dubai Outsource City, effective 31 October. Clearly marked T-code areas now provide structured parking for workers, residents, and visitors in two of the city’s busiest business hubs.Parkin confirmed the introduction of two new paid parking zones under the T-code system — Zone Code 675T in Dubai Studio City and Zone Code 812T in Dubai Outsource City. Clear signboards have been installed throughout both locations to identify the designated areas.Paid parking operates daily from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., with the following tariff structure:These rates align with Parkin’s broader T-code pricing framework applied in several of Dubai’s newly developed areas.Residents and professionals working in Dubai Studio City and Dubai Outsource City can also access Parkin’s subscription plans, designed for regular or long-term parking users. The subscription packages are priced as follows:These options provide cost savings and convenience for individuals who park frequently within these zones, particularly those employed in the area’s media, technology, and outsourcing sectors.The addition of the new T-code zones follows a series of expansions undertaken by Parkin throughout 2024. In August, new paid parking zones were introduced in Al Jaddaf, with Zone 326C (on-street) and Zone 326D (off-street) implementing variable charges that differ between peak and non-peak hours.During the same period, Parkin brought 2,100 parking spaces across 59 mosques in Dubai under its management. Worshippers are entitled to one hour of free parking during prayer times, while standard paid parking applies outside those hours.Earlier in the year, the operator introduced additional zones in Mirdif, which remain free on Sundays and public holidays and feature variable fees based on demand. A new parking zone was also announced in Al Khail Gate in July, further broadening Parkin’s reach across the emirate.Parkin’s latest expansion underscores its central role in shaping Dubai’s public parking infrastructure. By extending managed parking to fast-growing commercial areas such as Dubai Studio City and Dubai Outsource City, the company continues to support urban development with organised, technology-driven parking solutions.As Dubai’s population and business activity expand, these additions reflect a consistent strategy: extending accessibility, ensuring clarity through signposted zones, and offering flexible options for both short-term visitors and long-term residents.","Parkin PJSC, the emirate’s largest public parking operator, has added paid parking zones in Dubai Studio City and Dubai Outsource City, effective 31 October.

New lane rules for delivery riders in Dubai and Sharjah

What’s changing: Penalties and monitoring

What delivery riders and customer should know

For delivery riders:

From Nov 1, check which lanes you’re allowed to use — it depends on the road width. Be aware of heightened surveillance (cameras, radars) and steeper fines/permit risks. Speed-limit behaviour is under sharper scrutiny.

For delivery companies:

Make sure riders are informed and trained on new rules. Update routing so bikes avoid prohibited lanes — this may affect delivery time slightly. Monitor riders’ permit status and company liability in case of violations.

For customers and general road users:

Expect improvements in lane discipline and perhaps fewer accidents involving delivery bikes. Delivery-times might get affected in the fine-tuning period. Awareness of the rules might help smoother traffic flow.

Conclusion





Food may still come fast, but delivery riders won’t be allowed to race to get it to you anymore. In a joint announcement made in late October 2025, Dubai’s RTA and Sharjah Police unveiled tough new traffic rules for delivery riders, warning that reckless riding could now lead to Dh1,500 fines, suspended permits, and even platform bans. The message from authorities is clear: safety over speed.From November 1, 2025, the emirates of Dubai and Sharjah will see strict new regulations targeting delivery motorcycles and heavy-vehicles. In Dubai, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in coordination with Dubai Police will ban delivery riders from using the fastest lanes on major roads. On roads with five or more lanes, they cannot ride in the two leftmost (fastest) lanes; on roads with three or four lanes, they cannot use the leftmost lane. This change follows a rise in road accidents involving delivery riders.In Sharjah, authorities are implementing a dedicated lane-management system: heavy-vehicles and buses must keep to the far-right lanes, while motorcycles (including delivery bikes) will be restricted to the middle or right lanes depending on road width (for example: on a four-lane road they can use the two right-most lanes; on a two-lane road only the right lane).Enforcement will rely on smart radars, high-definition cameras and 24-hour monitoring.The new rules aren’t just about new signs, they come with significant consequences. In Dubai, fines start at AED 500 for a first offence, AED 700 for the second offence, and on the third violation the delivery rider’s permit may be suspended. Violations of speed limits (exceeding 100 km/h) by delivery bikes are also targeted: the first time AED 200, rising to AED 300 and AED 400 for repeat offences. In Sharjah, heavy vehicles failing to stay in designated lanes face fines up to AED 1,500 plus 12 traffic-black-points; riders ignoring lane signs may face fines around AED 500.The motive behind the crackdown: a steep rise in accidents involving delivery riders and the growing number of delivery bikes on the road, prompted by booming e-commerce and food-delivery sectors. These measures form part of broader traffic-safety strategies focusing on enforcement, road engineering and awareness campaigns.This latest crackdown clearly signals that Dubai and Sharjah are taking the rapid surge in delivery-motorcycle traffic seriously, and moving decisively from reactive to proactive traffic-safety governance. By strictly restricting faster lanes and consistently enforcing penalties, authorities hope to significantly reduce reckless riding, collisions, and fatalities. For riders, it means gradual adaptation; for everyone else, it means potentially safer roads and clearer separation of different types of vehicles.If you’re involved in the delivery business (rider, fleet manager, platform) or you’re a road user in these emirates, mark the date November 1, 2025, the rules change then. Being aware today means avoiding fines tomorrow.","From November 1, 2025, the emirates of Dubai and Sharjah will see strict new regulations targeting delivery motorcycles and heavy-vehicles.

UAE Global Win: Dubai crowned for having the best AI governance strategy in the world,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-global-win-dubai-crowned-for-having-the-best-ai-governance-strategyintheworld/articleshow/124939282.cms,"Dubai’s GDRFA wins global AI award for smarter services / Image: AI World Series Awards

Dubai’s winning moment on the global stage

Zero Compromise on Privacy: Your personal data and identity records are protected by the world's most rigorously controlled AI framework.



Faster Service: The underlying AI systems are governed for peak efficiency, meaning smoother, quicker interactions at airports and during residency transactions.



World-Class Trust: Dubai is now officially recognized as having the safest and most ethical digital ecosystem for identity and travel services.

How does GDRFA's AI strategy work and why won?

How will services likely change?

Faster e-gates and document-free lanes for eligible travellers, decreasing wait times.



More accurate identity checks reducing manual errors at counters and during visa processing.



Expanded online self-service so residents can complete renewals, status checks and appeals faster through secure portals.



Why does this matter beyond Dubai?





If you’ve ever wished government services were as fast and smooth as your favourite app, Dubai just turned that wish into reality. In a proud moment for the UAE, the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA) has been crowned for having the Best AI Governance Strategy in the world, setting a new benchmark for citizen-first digital services.The award celebrates GDRFA’s standout success in building a transparent, responsible, and citizen-centric AI ecosystem, particularly in immigration, residency services, and smart travel solutions. The win places Dubai ahead of several major international competitors, marking a milestone moment not only for the UAE but also for the wider Gulf region, as the government proves it can outperform global tech powerhouses in AI excellence.GDRFA was judged as the global gold standard for how the government should manage smart technology. For you, the beneficiary, this means:GDRFA’s winning edge comes from a clear and responsible approach to using artificial intelligence across Dubai’s residency and travel systems. Instead of adopting AI just for speed or automation, the department built a framework focused on accuracy, data protection, transparency, and human oversight, the key criteria that impressed the judges at the AI World Series Awards 2025.At the heart of the strategy is GDRFA’s investment in smart border control, biometric verification, predictive analysis for travel flows, and AI-assisted visa services, which together ensure faster processing with fewer errors. What sets Dubai apart is that every AI tool in its ecosystem is ethically governed, meaning decisions affecting residents, tourists or visa applicants are monitored and validated to remain fair, secure, and unbiased.This approach not only helped GDRFA raise service efficiency, but also positioned Dubai as a global benchmark for safe, reliable, and future-ready AI in government services, the exact reason it outperformed many global contenders.Expect a few user-facing shifts in coming months:These improvements are the direct payoff when governance-focused AI moves from lab to live systems: better user experience without trading off transparency or legal safeguards.Dubai’s win is a signal to businesses and travellers across the Gulf that public-sector AI can be both innovative and accountable. Strong governance attracts international investment, reassures visitors, and encourages other government bodies to adopt similar safeguards, a virtuous cycle that can boost tourism, speed cross-border travel, and improve regional interoperability of digital ID systems. In short: better governance = better public trust = more people comfortable using digital services.","The General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA) has been crowned for having the Best AI Governance Strategy in the world.

Saudi Arabia’s 'Stadium in the Sky' for 2034 FIFA World Cup: separating fact from fiction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabias-stadium-in-the-sky-for-2034-fifa-world-cup-separating-fact-from-fiction/articleshow/124930769.cms,"The Fact: A NEOM stadium is planned — but not in the sky





FIFA Shuts Down Trump's 2026 World Cup 'Unsafe Cities' Threat With Bold Remark

The Fiction: The viral “sky stadium” videos are AI-generated





Fact vs Fiction





The Bigger Picture





The Bottom Line









The internet can turn a concept sketch into a global sensation. In late October 2025, millions of people across X, TikTok, and YouTube watched a video showing what appeared to be a floating football stadium — a glowing bowl suspended 350 metres above the desert, nestled within Saudi Arabia’s futuristic city, NEOM: The Line. The captions were breathless: this was, they claimed, the NEOM Sky Stadium, a billion-dollar venue for the 2034 FIFA World Cup.It looked like the future of football. It wasn’t.Saudi Arabia’s official bid book for the 2034 FIFA World Cup lists 15 stadiums across Riyadh, Jeddah, Al Khobar, Abha, and NEOM. One of them, the NEOM Stadium, is described as being “more than 350 metres above ground level, within The Line.”That last phrase — “within The Line” — is what caused all the confusion.The stadium isn’t floating on a tower. It’s designed to be inside The Line’s vertical structure, part of a multi-level megacity that stacks entire neighbourhoods in layers. The stadium will occupy the fourth and fifth levels of this vast mirrored structure, making it high-altitude, but still fully enclosed.As ESPN reported, “the actual stadium proposed for construction in NEOM has been officially listed as one of the 15 host stadiums being either renovated or built from scratch for the FIFA 2034 World Cup for almost a year, and the Saudis do plan for it to be 350 metres above the ground.That is because they plan for it to form part of The Line, a proposed smart, green city in NEOM that will eventually extend in linear fashion for over 100 miles across the northwest Saudi province of Tabuk by 2045, powered entirely by renewable energy. ”Planned to seat around 46,000 spectators, the futuristic venue will be powered entirely by renewable energy and surrounded by a vibrant sports and wellness district, complete with hotels, apartments, and an integrated electric transport network. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2027 and finish between 2032 and 2039, though The Line itself remains in its early visionary stages of development.The viral clips of a glowing stadium hovering above the desert are not official footage. They were created by AI artists and CGI design accounts using programs such as Midjourney and Unreal Engine, taking NEOM’s futuristic imagery and exaggerating it for dramatic effect.Architectural analysts have pointed out the visual giveaways: lighting that doesn’t behave naturally, impossible reflections, and looping crowds that repeat in perfect synchrony. Even the drone-like camera sweeps in these videos defy real-world physics.NEOM’s official social media channels have not commented on these viral clips, and no government or FIFA outlet has ever released or endorsed them. The denials have instead come from journalists and design experts who confirmed that no such renders appear in the official World Cup bid or in NEOM’s verified materials.Several viral claims have blurred the line between fact and fantasy. The notion that Saudi Arabia is building a floating arena is false — official documents make clear the stadium is built within The Line’s vertical city, not on top of it. The circulating videos aren’t real construction footage; they’re AI-created visuals shared by fan-art accounts. Some users claimed Saudi officials had released these renders, but there’s no public statement or official post confirming or denying them. And despite online speculation, no construction has started; the project remains in its design phase, with The Line itself still under early development.Saudi Arabia’s 2034 World Cup forms part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030, a massive plan to transform the Kingdom into a global hub for sport, tourism, and technology. Projects such as The Line, Qiddiya, and New Murabba symbolise this futuristic ambition.Yet these megaprojects also face heavy criticism. Human-rights groups have documented forced evictions, executions of displaced tribespeople, and labour exploitation linked to NEOM’s construction. For many, the shimmering renderings of desert utopias mask a harsher reality on the ground.So while the AI-generated “stadium in the sky” dazzles online, the real story is more grounded — a mix of breathtaking ambition, architectural experimentation, and moral controversy.Saudi Arabia’s “Stadium in the Sky” exists only on screens. There is a NEOM Stadium planned for the 2034 World Cup — a high-altitude arena built within a vertical city, not floating above it. The viral clips showing a glowing bowl suspended over the desert are digital illusions, not construction updates. Like much of NEOM itself, the stadium represents a dream halfway between technology and theatre — where aspiration meets illusion, and the future of football is still being rendered.","Saudi Arabia’s official bid book for the 2034 World Cup lists 15 stadiums across Riyadh, Jeddah, Al Khobar, Abha, and NEOM.

The high-fashion Halloween evolution in Dubai

Russia Threatens US Over ‘Provocative’ Action Against Venezuela

What’s ahead for 2025 and beyond





Dubai’s Halloween scene has blossomed into a high-fashion spectacle where fantasy and luxury merge under desert skies. From rooftop catwalks and masquerade dinners to influencer-hosted beach parties, the emirate’s Halloween nights are now curated experiences driven by style, brand activations and social-media moments. These lavish events reflect Dubai’s rising status as a global influencer hub and show how Halloween has been reinvented beyond costumes or candy.Over recent years Dubai has transformed Halloween into more than a celebration of scares. Luxury venues are adopting theatrical themes ranging from “cursed circus” soirées to futuristic masquerade balls. Immersive indoor festivals and private yacht parties present Halloween as a glamour-led celebration designed for nightlife, fashion and photography. The emphasis is on exclusive access and Instagram-ready aesthetics.Influencers and content creators sit at the centre of this new Halloween culture. Invited as VIP guests, they dress to theme and share every detail—helping venues and brands amplify visibility. From bespoke masks to couture-level costumes, attendees treat the night as a runway. Guests no longer simply wear outfits; they curate characters, producing content that transforms Halloween into a lifestyle showcase.Dubai’s climate, culture and infrastructure all support this transformation. Warm weather allows glamorous outdoor events where costume couture shines. The city’s hospitality industry offers five-star rooftops, beach clubs and desert resorts perfect for large-scale themed celebrations. With a diverse expat population eager for global festivities, the city fuses international Halloween energy with a signature layer of extravagance.These curated nights strengthen Dubai’s image as a premium entertainment hub. For brands, Halloween becomes a marketing moment to launch collections, host fashion shows or align products with glamour and fantasy. For tourism, it adds another seasonal highlight that draws high-spending travellers looking for experiences that blend nightlife with luxury.Dubai’s Halloween celebrations show no signs of slowing. Organisers are likely to introduce even more immersive experiences: desert fashion festivals, celebrity-hosted events, high-tech masquerade lighting and global influencer collaborations. As competition grows, venues are expected to push creativity further—turning Halloween into a curated, multi-day luxury spectacle.","Dubai’s Halloween scene has blossomed into a high-fashion spectacle where fantasy and luxury merge under desert skies.

UK launches first digital ID: Is it similar to India's Aadhaar? Full details of the plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-launches-first-digital-id-is-it-similar-to-indias-aadhaar-full-details-of-the-plan/articleshow/124630189.cms,"AI image used for representative purpose

Why UK government launched this plan



What is the use of ID?



How Veteran can use access digital IDs?



Is it similar to India?







The UK government launched the digital version of its ID scheme on Friday, intended for former members of the armed services.This ID will mean passports, driving licenses, national insurance cards, and many more being virtual, instead of—or as well as—being stored in a shoebox or under socks in a drawer, Sky News reported.The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.The govt claims the initiative is designed to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for those without status to secure employment.Ministers contend that the ability to obtain jobs is a primary attraction for migrants entering the UK unlawfully. Under the new system, employers will no longer be able to depend on National Insurance numbers—which currently serve as part of proof of the right to work—or on paper-based verification methods, BBC reported.""At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy—people sharing National Insurance numbers for example. The idea is that having a picture attached would make it—in theory—harder to abuse that system,"" a government spokesperson explained.The digital IDs, which will be app-based and stored on smartphones akin to the NHS App or digital bank cards, will contain information such as the holder's residency status, name, date of birth, nationality, and a photograph.Sir Keir, when announcing the scheme, stated: ""You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that.""From today, Friday 17 October, it will give ex-soldiers a seamless way to confirm their status in person and will include information already featured on their physical card with the security features that protect their personal information.Ministers hope the digital veteran card will show how the technology works and quash public concerns about privacy and security.Veterans will now be able to hold their credentials in a smartphone app called Gov.uk One Login. The govt had previously announced that digital credentials, including the veteran card, would be stored in an app named Gov.uk Wallet. It now states it will “transition to talking about [One Login] as the Gov.uk Wallet” as more govt-issued credentials become available digitally. The credential will be stored under encryption in the app, similar to how a train or concert ticket is held in an Apple or Google wallet, The Guardian reported.Verification using face ID or a fingerprint will be required to access it, and the govt claims it is safer than physical IDs. Another version of the credential will be held by the Ministry of Defence, and as more IDs are added, the information will remain with each issuer and in the citizens’ app, ensuring there is no central database of all ID data, thereby avoiding what some have feared could be a “honeypot for hackers”.India has well established digital ID system. India’s digital ID system, Aadhaar, is significantly larger and more detailed than the UK’s planned system.New Delhi stores citizens’ fingerprints, eye scans, photos, home addresses and phone numbers, with the system processing approximately 80 million authentications daily.Under Aadhaar, every Indian citizen receives a 12-digit number intended to replace numerous paper documents. All adults and children over the age of five must provide biometric information. The system verifies identities for activities such as opening bank accounts or applying for new SIM cards. It also aimed to streamline the disbursement of govt benefits, providing holders with instant proof of identity and access to basic services.Aadhaar and UK's digital ID seems to be same.India also have other apps like DigiLocker, where you can store all the important documents like Aadhar Card, Pan card, driving license digitally at one place, Digi Yatra and many more.The UK's digital ID seems to be following the similar model of India. Like DigiLocker, UK is introducing Gov.UK Wallet. Few days ago, UK PM Keir Starmer made his first trip to India and hailed India’s ID system as a “massive success”.During his trade-centric visit to Mumbai, Starmer also met with Nandan Nilekani, co-founder and chair of Indian tech services group Infosys, who led the govt body responsible for delivering the ID database more than a decade ago.",The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.

Why the Republican party is red — even thought red usually means the Left,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-the-republican-party-is-red-even-thought-red-usually-means-the-left/articleshow/125035688.cms,"The Big Picture

Driving the History

Why It Matters

The Takeaway





In most parts of the world, red is the colour of revolution — socialism, labour movements, and left-wing politics. From the Bolshevik flag to Britain’s Labour rose, red has long been the hue of the Left. Yet in the United States, it’s the conservative Republican Party that’s bathed in crimson. How did that happen?The Republican Party’s red branding has nothing to do with ideology and everything to do with television graphics. The colour-coding of U.S. politics — red for Republicans, blue for Democrats — is a media invention that only became standard after the 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore.Before that, different networks used different colours: NBC might show Republicans in blue, while CBS showed them in red. There was no fixed rule.In early election broadcasts (1950s–1990s), American TV networks used contrasting colours to make electoral maps easy to read, but the assignments varied from year to year.The 1976 and 1980 elections, for example, saw blue Republicans and red Democrats on some channels.The convention flipped permanently in 2000, when 24-hour coverage of the Bush-Gore contest forced networks to pick a single scheme and stick with it.CNN, NBC, and others settled on red for Republicans and blue for Democrats — partly because red begins with “R” and blue felt cooler and calmer, fitting the Democratic image.The dramatic Florida recount and prolonged media coverage cemented the colour identities in public consciousness. “Red states” and “blue states” entered the American lexicon almost overnight.The colour divide has since become a cultural shorthand for America’s deep political polarisation. “Red America” now evokes conservative, rural, or evangelical regions, while “Blue America” signifies liberal, urban, coastal enclaves. Yet the irony remains: in most of the world, red still means the Left.The Republican Party didn’t choose red — television did. What began as a convenient graphic design choice in a contentious election year ended up rewriting America’s political colour code.In short: red turned right — by accident, not by ideology.","The colour-coding of U.S. politics is a media invention.

This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

""Open networks are the digital rails for the next generation of AI, and Beckn Onix is the catalyst for action: an organisation that used to wait months to onboard can now start leveraging AI-driven solutions and creating new value for society in a fraction of that time.

It provides the essential, secure and scalable infrastructure for AI-driven solutions to be deployed across diverse, high-impact sectors like agriculture, healthcare, mobility, and more.

It has the potential to empower millions of people in emerging markets around the world, from farmers to small business owners and entrepreneurs.""

What is Beckn Onix and how it works



“open networks”





Beckn Labs has partnered with Google Cloud to launch Beckn Onix, a new open-source app designed to accelerate the development and adoption of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) built with the Beckn Protocol. This initiative was announced in advance of the Global DPI Summit 2025. Beckn Onix aims to promote inclusive growth for individuals and communities across various population-scale sectors, including agriculture, healthcare, skilling, energy, tourism, and mobility. The tool addresses technical complexities faced by governments and organisations when connecting diverse, existing IT systems to new open network protocols. With Beckn Onix, custom-built integrations, which are often expensive and difficult to maintain and scale, can be avoided. This will allow for a more streamlined approach to building open networks.Commenting on the partnership, Anil Bhansali, VP of engineering at Google Cloud, said:The Beckn protocol is an open, decentralised standard that enables buyers and sellers to interact and transact without relying on a single controlling platform or intermediary. It lowers entry barriers for merchants and businesses, allowing them to createfor selling their products and services and offering more opportunities for participation across the supply chain.Earlier, building such open networks could take startups or organisations four to five months. Beckn Onix is the first scalable, cloud-native implementation of the Beckn Protocol, now available on GitHub. Governments and businesses using Beckn Onix can integrate AI-based features into open networks from the start, using Google’s open-source Agent Development Kit. This helps developers quickly create user-friendly agents that simplify workflows while using Gemini or any other AI model.With Beckn Onix, entrepreneurs, business owners, governments, and public sector bodies can build open networks connecting buyers and sellers in as little as 45 minutes.Beckn Onix also works as a universal ""adapter"" or ""bridge,"" allowing an organisation’s existing backend systems to connect securely with other platforms on an open network. Its flexible, plugin-based design enables organisations to choose preferred tools for signing, storage, or monitoring, helping them build an open, interoperable, and adaptable ecosystem.Beckn Onix is already in use in Uttar Pradesh, where Google Cloud helped the state government develop an Open Network Stack for Agriculture (ONA). The project has connected over 12,800 farmers, helping them improve their profitability.","Beckn Labs has partnered with Google Cloud to launch Beckn Onix.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai celebrates new breakthrough in quantum algorithm; Elon Musk replies: ‘Looks like…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-celebrates-new-breakthrough-in-quantum-algorithm-elon-musk-replies-looks-like/articleshow/124754841.cms,"



What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently shared a post on X, formerly Twitter, announcing a new breakthrough in quantum algorithms. “Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage,” Pichai wrote in the post, adding it is “13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers”. Pichai’s post caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk . The tech billionaire replied to Pichai’s post saying “Congrats. Looks like quantum computing is becoming relevant.”Announcing the major breakthrough, Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote:The achievement marks a historic breakthrough in quantum computing. For the first time ever, a quantum computer has performed a complex, verifiable calculation faster than any supercomputer could — about 13,000 times faster. This moment is being called a “verifiable quantum advantage.""Using Google’s Willow quantum chip, researchers ran an advanced algorithm called Quantum Echoes (or OTOC — out-of-order time correlator).This algorithm helps scientists study how information spreads in quantum systems — things like molecules, magnets, or even black holes.The key part: the result was verifiable and repeatable, meaning other quantum computers could confirm it independently.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently shared a post on X, formerly Twitter, announcing a new breakthrough in quantum algorithms.

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including Squid Game Unleased which hit #1 in 26 countries. You’ll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles – they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through. As for Bill, Scott and me – we’re going to take a little breather before tackling whatever is next. Love to hear from you if there’s anything interesting going on, workwise or otherwise.Another employee, David Luehmann, a director of game development at the studio, also posted on LinkedIn, saying, ""After 10+ great years working at Boss Fight, the last few as part of Netflix, the time has come for the studio to close down.""“I am very proud of all the people, work, and games we've released. I wish you could see what we had cooking! There are many talented people that have been impacted by this.
