Tom Brady continues to remain single ever after being linked to high profile women







Tom Brady and Gisele B√ºndchen went their separate ways in 2022 but the two have been successfully coparenting their two children. While Gisele B√ºndchen now has a new family with Joaquim Valente, Tom Brady remains single. In the last few months, Gisele B√ºndchen has been spotted alongside her boyfriend and her newborn in Florida but now, she stunned her fans in a new outfit.The former Victoria‚Äôs Secret model was spotted showing off her toned body in Florida as she wore a one piece white coloured swimsuit along with a pair of sunglasses and a brown hat.Gisele B√ºndchen was also seen keeping her accessories to a minimum as she wore a necklace and a pair of earrings to complete her look. She was spotted standing on a paddle boat, probably to spend another day soaking up the sun.Ever since her third child was born, Gisele B√ºndchen along with her boyfriend, Joaquim Valente, has been spotted spending weekends relaxing on their yacht as the couple soaked up the sun. They have also been spotted hosting parties for their close friends on their yacht.While Gisele B√ºndchen is seemingly enjoying her new life, it seems like Tom Brady is struggling in his personal life when it comes to dating.Recently, according to Radar Online, a source has revealed that, ""When he is on dates, he just talks about himself and how miserable he is, and women are saying he's not worth the hassle‚Ä¶That is never attractive to the opposite sex. It means he's got too much baggage to attempt another meaningful relationship, or even a fun fling.""Ever since Tom Brady announced his divorce from Gisele B√ºndchen, he has not been able to get into a serious relationship with any of the women he has been linked to. While there were strong rumours of a relationship brewing between Tom Brady and Irina Shayk, things fizzled out pretty quickly.Similarly, there were rumours of reality TV star and famous socialite and entrepreneur, Kim Kardashian and Tom Brady, but again, nothing worked out between the two.For now, Gisele B√ºndchen is enjoying her relaxing and laid back life while Tom Brady is focusing on parenting and work.Also Read: ""He whines about his ex"": Insiders reveal what‚Äôs holding Tom Brady back from moving on after his failed marriage with Gisele B√ºndchen","Tom Brady and Gisele B√ºndchen went their separate ways in 2022.

Sam Altman just dropped a big AI prediction for 2026; experts are skeptical,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sam-altman-just-dropped-a-big-ai-prediction-for-2026-experts-are-skeptical/articleshow/121811592.cms,"Sam Altman AI prediction for 2026

What Sam Altman really said: AI with ""novel insights"" by 2026

""By 2026, we will likely see the arrival of systems that can figure out novel insights,""

What does ""novel insight"" really mean

An AI race for survival: Other technology giants are not lagging behind

Google DeepMind just released a paper on AlphaEvolve, a coding AI agent that created innovative solutions to challenging math problems, something even accomplished researchers hadn't tried.

Anthropic founder of Claude AI, established a research grant program in May 2025 to support research projects that employ AI to generate scientific hypotheses and conduct experiments.

FutureHouse, founded by ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt, states its AI assisted in an actual scientific breakthrough, though details are kept under wraps.

Lila Sciences, a startup by now-former OpenAI researcher Kenneth Stanley, has raised $200 million to create a lab dedicated to teaching AI models to ask more intelligent scientific questions, a basic prerequisite for insight.

Why 'novel insights' from AI might still be useless, experts say

In a fresh thought-provoking article entitled ""The Gentle Singularity,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has again moved in with a daring prediction: by 2026, artificial intelligence systems will be able to make ""novel insights."" The claim may sound ambiguous in itself, yet in the context of the developing objectives of OpenAI and the wider competitive scene of AI research, it weighs. Altman, who is famous for his futurist vision and bold declarations regarding artificial general intelligence (AGI), presents this forecast as part of an extended evolution of human society, one where AI remakes work, energy, innovation, and even scientific breakthroughs.His essay, released June 10, 2025, is more than prediction; it can be used as an unofficial guide for where OpenAI and its competitors are going next. This race towards AI systems coming up with genuine, new ideas instead of merely recombining present information is becoming the next arms race in technology innovation. With major breakthroughs being achieved by Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and upstart companies such as Lila Sciences and FutureHouse, the stakes are high not just for corporate hegemony but for the future of science itself.Altman's essay describes his vision for the ""gentle singularity,"" an era in which AGI does not destroy or dismantle civilization but rather becomes a productive, evolutionary partner to humans. Perhaps one of the most remarkable things he predicts is this:This matter-of-fact-sounding sentence has huge implications. First of all, it indicates that OpenAI is approaching a level of model capability where artificial intelligence can move past summarization, prediction, or pattern matching and start to think creatively. This is the distinction between an AI that simply reports data and one that adds meaningfully to human knowledge.OpenAI President and co-founder Greg Brockman has recently supported this concept when announcing the o3 and o4-mini models in April 2025. ""These were the first models scientists used to create useful new ideas in their field,"" he declared, suggesting that OpenAI is already developing the kind of AI that Altman described in his essay.The ""novel insight"" in AI is the capability of the AI model to generate new, valuable, and hitherto not thought-provoking ideas or hypotheses. This characteristic stretches much beyond the current realm of capabilities of AI chatbots and big language models that are based on spewing out known facts.Altman's prophetic essay is not isolated. Over the past few months, a host of major players have taken strategic actions in line with the premise of ""novel insight"" creation:Even as the hype sets in, top AI minds remain hesitant. Hugging Face Chief Science Officer Thomas Wolf recently contended that existing models can't pose genuinely new questions, a precondition for any scientific breakthrough. Likewise, Kenneth Stanley himself concedes that the issue is ""fundamentally difficult,"" not merely a matter of computational horsepower but modeling what humans find ""interesting"" or ""meaningful."" Others argue that while AI can recombine existing ideas in surprising ways, it lacks the context to understand why a question matters. This limitation keeps it tethered to patterns, not purpose, reducing its role to augmentation rather than true innovation.Creativity is not just computation, but intuition and judgment areas where AI still lags. This means that even if models can generate new hypotheses, it remains unclear how useful, testable, or correct these insights will be. In science, novelty alone isn't enough; it must be actionable and verifiable. Until AI bridges that gap, its 'insights' may remain intellectually impressive but practically inert.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicts that by 2026, AI systems will be able to make ""novel insights"" ""Novel insight"" is the capability of the AI model to generate new, valuable, and hitherto not thought-provoking ideas or hypotheses.

Steve Jobs was brilliant but don‚Äôt copy this 'one habit' of him; warns Pixar's Pete Docter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/steve-jobs-was-brilliant-but-dont-copy-this-one-habit-of-him-warns-pixars-pete-docter/articleshow/121851338.cms,"Steve Jobs was brilliant but don‚Äôt copy this 'one habit' of him; warns Pixar's Pete Docter

Why Steve Jobs told Pixar, ‚ÄúThis Is Not My Business‚Äù - and meant it



Decoding genius: Steve Jobs' ability to distill complexity

Steve Jobs called at 3 AM - Pete Docter says that‚Äôs ‚Äòone habit‚Äô you shouldn‚Äôt copy



Behind the scenes: Pixar's quiet rise to the top

Leadership lessons for today's visionaries

When Steve Jobs bought Pixar from George Lucas in 1986 for $10 million, few could have imagined the impact this would have - both on animation, but ultimately on the future of creative entrepreneurship. Pixar was then a struggling graphics division with limited numbers and grand aspirations. Jobs‚Äô decision was widely considered risky, especially since the company had yet to prove itself as a viable business in the entertainment space. But what unfolded over the next two decades transformed not only the fate of Pixar, but also Jobs‚Äô legacy beyond Apple Fast forward to 2025, and Pixar is one of the world's most legendary animation houses, with a catalog of Oscar winners and a reputation for storytelling greatness. A lot of that, Chief Creative Officer Pete Docter says, had to do with Jobs' none-too-hands-on approach to creative choices but rather with his skill at stepping back. Speaking at the Fast Company Most Innovative Companies Summit, Docter drew from Jobs' distinctive style of leadership, offering never-before-heard perspectives that highlight how restraint, emotional intelligence, and prioritisation guided Pixar's path.Though he was the executive producer and economic lifeline of Pixar, Steve Jobs never attempted to influence the storytelling direction of the studio. Pete Docter, the company's third animator who is now the brains behind movies such as Up and Inside Out, noted that Jobs kept out of his way. ""Steve was really good at saying, 'This is not my business,'"" Docter recalled.This amount of creative trust is not to be found, particularly from a person who's been stereotyped as a micromanager in his early days at Apple. Yet Jobs at Pixar seemed to know that good storytelling took room. He funded the humans, the technology, and the buildings but he never attempted to ""direct the director."" Rather, he listened. He provided counsel when required. He entered not as a general, but as a partner.This methodology enabled Pixar's artists to experiment freely. It created the foundation for the studio's unprecedented success, beginning with Toy Story in 1995, the first computer-animated full-length feature film, and followed up with Finding Nemo, Ratatouille, Up, Inside Out, and Soul.Jobs wasn't only hands-off, he was laser-sharp when it counted. Jobs, Docter said, had a talent for entering into a complicated conversation and, in a matter of minutes, being able to identify the root of the issue. ""He could sit for about five minutes and review what the conversation was actually about,"" Docter said. ""That's not something anyone's born with. It was the result of years of practice.This ability, cutting through noise to locate the signal is what made Jobs such a good strategist, even beyond his comfort zone. Whether it was a meeting regarding server capacity, distribution logistics, or creative tone, Jobs was able to immediately grasp the crux of the problem and challenge his team to crack it.This ability wasn‚Äôt just intellectual, it was emotional. Jobs was able to read the currents in a room, detect underlying tensions, and gently move individuals toward understanding. In a time when numerous leaders are concerned with establishing dominance, Jobs' strength resided in his ability to see what truly counted and to pose the proper questions rather than provide all the solutions.But even visionaries are not perfect and Docter wasn't afraid to call them out. One of Jobs' most infamous tendencies was his lack of respect for boundaries. ‚ÄúHe would call ‚Äî especially the producers ‚Äî at any time, day or night, 3 in the morning, you‚Äôre on vacation, doesn‚Äôt matter,‚Äù Docter revealed. ‚ÄúHe wants to talk to you about it, you‚Äôre on.‚ÄùThis intensity, while sometimes idealized, also produced burnout and stress. Jobs' all-consuming urgency was galvanizing but draining. Docter conceded that he's tried not to inherit that specific habit, although he occasionally sends late-night emails himself too. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what my wife is trying to get me to stop doing,‚Äù he joked.This story is a cautionary tale: even the greatest leaders need to discover where to set limits. Passion is great but boundaries allow for long-term success.While Pixar's meteoric ascendancy is invariably linked with technical ingenuity and storytelling brilliance, its organizational culture also played a pivotal role. Jobs permitted the studio to forge its own identity even when Disney acquired Pixar for $7.4 billion in 2006, rendering him the largest Disney shareholder at the time.Former Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger once said he expected Jobs to be tough. But instead, he found him to be open-minded and reflective. ‚ÄúWho wouldn‚Äôt want Steve Jobs to have influence over how a company is run?‚Äù Iger told Vanity Fair in an interview.Jobs' commitment to explaining things until they made sense, not mandating decisions by hierarchy, served to maintain Pixar's creative DNA even within the gigantic edifice of Disney. He did not care to win arguments. He craved alignment and that made him an unusual executive in Silicon Valley and Hollywood.In the modern world of high-pressure startups, midnight Slack messages, and always-on culture, Docter‚Äôs reflections offer a timely reminder: the most effective leaders are those who listen more than they talk. Jobs' legacy at Pixar wasn‚Äôt about control, it was about clarity.His genius wasn‚Äôt just in innovation, but in emotional strategy. He could read rooms, empower people, and know when to step back. Yet, his occasional lack of boundaries reminds current leaders that brilliance without empathy can cost relationships and morale.Pete Docter takes Pixar's helm with a more measured hand these days, blending Jobs' wisdom with his own sense of how creative individuals work best. As Pixar keeps pushing the boundaries of great storytelling, its core continues to be based on the culture Jobs helped foster - not by dictating it, but by believing in it.",Steve Jobs bought Pixar from George Lucas in 1986 for $10 million.

In a significant overhaul of Indian railways' ticketing policy, the Ministry of Railways made it clear that from July 1, 2025, only Aadhaar-verified users will be entitled to reserve tickets under the Tatkal system through the IRCTC portal or mobile application. It is a key step towards stricter digital identity authentication to prevent misuse, bring in more transparency, and ensure the facility of emergency ticketing reaches legitimate passengers.In a sequel to this order, the ministry has also directed an extra OTP-based Aadhaar authentication layer from July 15, 2025, in order to further rationalise the process. The Indian Railways' move, as conveyed to all zonal railway divisions on June 10, 2025, is in light of increasing festival season demand and growing complaints of manipulation of bookings by agents. Here is the entire explanation of the new regulations, implementation schedule, agent restrictions, and booking practical tips all passengers must be aware of.From July 1, Tatkal tickets could only be booked by passengers who have done Aadhaar authentication on IRCTC's website and mobile app.From July 15, 2025, even authenticated users will have to undergo a one-time password (OTP) authentication process associated with their Aadhaar number during every Tatkal booking.With a view to minimizing bulk bookings and ensuring level playing ground for the public:These restrictions will be applied on all zones and directions have been issued to both CRIS (Centre for Railway Information Systems) and IRCTC to enforce these steps by modifying back-end systems and user interfaces.The Railway Ministry has made it clear that the aim is to:The new policy essentially transforms the manner in which emergency train tickets will be secured in India.

A balanced diet means a cupcake in each hand

My wallet is like an onion When I open it it makes me cry

I cant believe I forgot to go to the gym today Thats 7 years in a row now

Im not clumsy The floor hates me the table and chairs are bullies and the walls get in my way

I didn't fall Im just spending some quality time with the floor

I would lose weight but I hate losing

Im not sleeping Im just resting my eyes

I followed a diet but it didn't follow me back So I unfollowed it

If there was an award for laziness I'd probably send someone to pick it up for me

I don't sweat I sparkle

Id agree with you but wed both be wrong

Im on my second guardian angel My first one quit and is now in therapy

I thought I wanted a career I just wanted paychecks

I‚Äôm not lazy I‚Äôm just on energy-saving mode

I need a six-month vacation twice a year

I put the pro in procrastinate

My bed and I are in a committed relationship

Running late is my cardio

Adulting is like folding a fitted sheet nobody really knows how

WiFi food my bed perfection achieved

I don‚Äôt rise and shine I caffeinate and hope

I‚Äôm not arguing I‚Äôm just explaining why I‚Äôm right

I followed my heart now I‚Äôm lost

Life is short smile while you still have teeth

If Monday had a face I‚Äôd punch it

I‚Äôm on a seafood diet I see food and I eat it

I whisper to my WiFi when it‚Äôs slow hoping it feels loved

I tried to be normal once worst two minutes ever

Common sense is like deodorant the people who need it never use it

My hobbies include eating and complaining that I‚Äôm getting fat

I‚Äôm not short I‚Äôm concentrated awesome

Who needs GPS when you have zero direction in life

I wish I were a unicorn so I could stab people with my head

I‚Äôm not weird I‚Äôm just limited edition

Why fall in love when you can fall asleep

Some people graduate with honors I am just honored to graduate

I‚Äôm silently correcting your grammar

WiFi food my bed Perfection

I‚Äôm great at multitasking I can waste time be unproductive and procrastinate all at once

Reality called so I hung up

I know the voices in my head aren‚Äôt real but they have great ideas

If Monday had a face I‚Äôd punch it

Life is short smile while you still have teeth

Love caption for WhatsApp status



You are the reason I look at my phone and smile

In your arms is where I find my peace

My favorite place in the world is next to you

You make my heart skip a beat

I didn‚Äôt choose you my heart did

Forever is not long enough with you

Every love story is beautiful but ours is my favorite

With you every moment is magical

You are the poem I never knew how to write

You had me at hello

I still fall for you every single day

Your smile is literally the cutest thing I‚Äôve ever seen

I just want to make you happy because you make me happy

You are my today and all of my tomorrows

Loving you is the best decision I ever made

The best feeling is when you look at me and smile

I saw that you were perfect and so I loved you

Then I saw that you were not perfect and I loved you even more

Your love is all I need to feel complete

You‚Äôre the reason behind my smile

You + Me = Forever

I never want to stop making memories with you

I fall in love with you more every day

You make my world brighter just by being in it

No one else matters when I‚Äôm with you

You are my sunshine on a cloudy day

Together is my favorite place to be

Your love is my favorite adventure

You are my definition of perfect

I wish time could stop when I‚Äôm with you

Your voice is my favorite sound

I didn‚Äôt believe in soulmates until I met you

Home is wherever I‚Äôm with you

Your hugs feel like home

I love you more than I have ever found a way to say

Just a kiss from you can fix everything

Being in your arms feels like home

You‚Äôre the reason my heart beats a little faster

My heart is perfect because you‚Äôre inside

You‚Äôre not my number one you‚Äôre my only one

Your love is the spark that lights up my soul

I found my forever when I found you

You‚Äôre the dream I never want to wake up from

When I‚Äôm with you time stands still

All I need is your hand in mine

Loving you feels like breathing effortless and essential

You are my heart‚Äôs favorite place to be

I love it when you call me yours

Every day with you is my favorite day

Emotional WhatsApp captions



I wish I could turn back time and make everything right

The saddest thing is feeling alone in a crowd

I‚Äôm drowning in memories and there‚Äôs no way out

Every heart has a pain only the way of expressing it is different

The hardest part is pretending to be happy

Some days I just want to disappear

It‚Äôs hard to find happiness when you feel like nothing

The silence after an argument is the loudest sound

It hurts when you realize you aren‚Äôt as important to someone as you thought

Saying goodbye to the one you love is like saying goodbye to your own happiness

Sometimes you have to pretend everything is fine when it‚Äôs not

I‚Äôm not okay but I‚Äôll pretend to be

Behind every strong person is a story that left them broken

Loving you was my favorite mistake

It‚Äôs hard to forget someone who was your entire life

I miss the old us

You left without a goodbye and now I‚Äôm left with the pieces

I wish I could stop loving you but my heart refuses to listen

Sometimes the people who are thousands of miles away from you can make you feel better than the ones right beside you

I thought I mattered but I was wrong

I‚Äôm tired of fighting for a love that‚Äôs already gone

The scars you can‚Äôt see are the hardest to heal

Tears speak when the heart can't

Smiling outside, breaking inside

Sometimes silence is the loudest cry

I‚Äôm tired of pretending I‚Äôm fine

Lost in a world that doesn‚Äôt see me

It hurts, but I‚Äôll deal with it

The worst pain is being forgotten

I miss the old me

We were perfect‚Ä¶ until we weren‚Äôt

Crying isn‚Äôt a weakness, it‚Äôs a release

The hardest part is acting like it‚Äôs okay

Some scars never show, but they‚Äôre the deepest

Loved too much, lost too hard

Trust once broken is hard to rebuild

Happiness left and didn‚Äôt say goodbye

I‚Äôm okay‚Ä¶ just tired of everything

When memories hurt more than they heal

Faking smiles is an exhausting job

Some wounds time doesn't heal

I'm not mad, just disappointed

Hope hurts more than letting go

People change, promises break

Missing you is a daily struggle

I wish feelings had an off switch

Loneliness feels louder at night

We said forever, but forever ended early

No more expectations, no more pain

Too broken to be fixed

Love left, emptiness stayed

Heart full of words never said

Life WhatsApp captions



Life isn‚Äôt perfect but it has perfect moments

Just because you‚Äôre breathing doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre living

Life goes on with or without you

Collect moments not things

Life is a one time offer use it well

Don‚Äôt count the days make the days count

Simplicity is the keynote of true life

Life is short smile while you still have teeth

Your vibe attracts your tribe

Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations

Life begins at the end of your comfort zone

Stay close to people who feel like sunshine

In the end we only regret the chances we didn‚Äôt take

Be yourself life‚Äôs too short to be anyone else

Life‚Äôs beauty lies in small moments

Life is tough but so are you

Fall in love with taking care of yourself

Live the story you want to tell

Don‚Äôt survive thrive

Life doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect to be beautiful

Let your life be your message

Live less out of habit more out of intent

You only live once but if you do it right once is enough

Life is a journey enjoy the ride

Don‚Äôt just exist live

Life is made of moments not milestones

Be the energy you want to attract

Make peace with your past so it doesn‚Äôt spoil your present

The best view comes after the hardest climb

Life rewards the brave

Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans

Live life to the fullest

To live is the rarest thing in the world Most people exist that is all

Life is short and its up to you to make it sweet

In the end its not the years in your life that count Its the life in your years

The purpose of life is to believe to hope and to strive

Life is about making an impact not making an income

Life is straightforward but we insist on complicating it

Life is a journey that must be traveled no matter how bad the roads and accommodations

Life is like riding a bicycle To keep your balance you must keep moving

Life is 10 percent what happens to us and 90 percent how we react to it

Life isn't about finding yourself. It's about creating yourself

Life is too important to be taken seriously

Life is short smile while you still have teeth

Life is a onetime offer use it well

Life is a beautiful struggle

Life is short and it is up to you to make it sweet

Life is a daring adventure or nothing at all

Life is made of ever so many partings welded together

Life is trying things to see if they work

New Tatkal ticket booking rules 2025: Tatkal ticket booking rules change from July 1: Aadhaar mandatory for IRCTC; how to link Aadhaar with IRCTC account,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/tatkal-ticket-booking-rules-change-from-july-1-aadhaar-mandatory-for-irctc-how-to-link-aadhaar-with-irctc-account/articleshow/121868049.cms,"How to link Aadhaar with IRCTC account

How to link Aadhaar to IRCTC account for Tatkal booking before the July 1 deadline

Pre-requisites:

An active IRCTC account

Your 12-digit Aadhaar number or Virtual ID

A mobile phone linked with your Aadhaar to receive OTPs

Follow the steps below:

Go to the official IRCTC website and log in with your credentials.

Go to the 'My Account' page and select 'Authenticate User'.

Provide your Aadhaar Number or Virtual ID.

Press 'Verify Details'.

You will receive an OTP on your registered mobile number.

Provide the OTP and authenticate after accepting the consent.

On successful authentication, a success message will be displayed.

How to add Aadhaar-verified passengers to your master list

Login to your IRCTC account and navigate to My Profile > Master List.

Enter the passenger's name, date of birth, and gender just like it appears on the Aadhaar card.

Choose 'Aadhaar Card' as ID proof and fill in the Aadhaar number.

Click 'Submit'. The status will display as Pending initially.

You may verify status through 'Check pending Aadhaar verification' link.

When verified, their information will be stored and automatically filled up while booking.

Tip

New Tatkal rules effective from July 1, 2025

1. Aadhaar verification becomes mandatory

From July 1, Tatkal tickets can be booked only by users who have validated their Aadhaar number with their IRCTC account.

This will mean that the passengers cannot proceed with Tatkal booking unless their IRCTC account has been Aadhaar linked and is verified through an OTP.

2. More OTP-Based Aadhaar Authentication from July 15

From July 15, even Aadhaar-authenticated users will be asked to perform an OTP-based authentication step associated with their Aadhaar number for every Tatkal booking.

This additional layer is for the purpose of confirming that the user making the booking is the actual account holder and to avoid account abuse or automation-driven manipulation.

3. Restrictions for agents

IRCTC agents will be prevented from booking Tatkal tickets within the first 30 minutes of the booking period.

AC Class (1A, 2A, 3A): Agents prohibited from booking between 10:00 AM and 10:30 AM



Non-AC Class (SL, 2S): Agents prohibited from booking between 11:00 AM and 11:30 AM

Why new Tatkal ticket rules are introduced

Stopping abuse of the Tatkal system by touts, bots, and unofficial agents.

Making room for actual last-minute passengers through eliminating artificial ticket shortages.

Improving online governance by combining Aadhaar-based identity verification with mainstream services.

Developing an honest, transparent system where mass automated bookings do not hold back common users.

In a significant policy change aimed at enhancing transparency, root out fraud, and provide equitable access to emergency train travel, the Ministry of Railways has made comprehensive changes in the Tatkal ticket reservation system that will come into effect from July 1, 2025. As per the new guidelines, only the users who have registered their Aadhaar number with their IRCTC account will be eligible to reserve Tatkal tickets online, ushering a new era of digitally verified travel in India.The shift, issued formally in a directive to all zonal railways on June 10, 2025, is a part of a larger effort to stem the rampant abuse of Tatkal tickets by unauthorized agents and bots. While Indian Railways has supported this step with an added Aadhaar-based OTP authentication level from July 15, 2025, to further robustify the booking process to benefit genuine last-minute travelers, the change is aimed to stem the rampant misuse of Tatkal tickets.To be eligible to book Tatkal tickets after July 1, follow these steps to link your Aadhaar:To make Tatkal booking faster, IRCTC provides the facility to pre-add passengers to your Master List and get them Aadhaar-verified.: Regularly update your Master List to prevent delays during peak Tatkal sessions.To avoid bulk bookings and provide regular users with a reasonable opportunity:The Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS) and IRCTC have been asked to make backend technical modifications to ensure these booking windows automatically. The clampdown on middlemen would drastically enhance Tatkal availability for solo passengers.As per Ministry of Railways officials, the primary reasons for the rule amendments are:The ministry underlined the fact that such changes are in concordance with the national policy of ""Digital India"" and aid e-governance and transparency in public-facing services.","New Tatkal rules effective from July 1, 2025.

Understanding Housing Grants and Loans

Housing Grants: These are typically aimed at low-income families, widows, divorcees with children, and people of determination (those with disabilities). Citizens who do not own property and meet the income requirements can apply for a grant. The key focus of grants is to provide financial aid for building new homes, maintaining old properties, or purchasing prefabricated housing solutions.





Housing Loans: Housing loans are designed for citizens with a stable income who can repay the amount over time. These loans are intended to help with building or buying homes, as well as renovating or expanding existing properties. The loan terms depend on the applicant‚Äôs financial status, and repayments are made monthly.

Navigating housing support in Dubai doesn‚Äôt have to be overwhelming, even though it can sometimes feel like a labyrinth. Understanding whether you're eligible for a housing grant or a housing loan is the first step toward making the right decision for your housing needs. Whether you're a first-time homebuilder, someone looking to renovate, or in need of a quick housing solution, Dubai‚Äôs government, through the Mohammed bin Rashid Housing Establishment, provides various options to make homeownership and improvement more accessible. Let's cut through the jargon and break down the essential details, eligibility, benefits, and application process, so you can find the best fit for your situation.The Mohammed bin Rashid Housing Establishment offers two primary forms of assistance for Dubai citizens: housing grants and housing loans. Each is designed to support citizens based on their specific financial situation, family status, and housing needs.According to the Mohammed bin Rashid Housing Establishment's mission, the goal is to provide adequate housing solutions to all eligible applicants, prioritizing low-income families and ensuring that housing developments reflect the unique cultural and social fabric of Dubai's communities.Citizenship and income level are the primary factors in determining eligibility for housing grants or loans.Both grants and loans prioritize married applicants, especially those with children. However, separated or divorced individuals may apply either jointly or individually, depending on their custody arrangement, as dictated by court rulings.The financial details for both grants and loans vary based on an applicant‚Äôs income and housing needs.For both options, the Mohammed bin Rashid Housing Establishment offers financial support up to Dh1 million, depending on the applicant‚Äôs case assessment. Loans are repaid in monthly installments, and the full loan repayment period can extend up to a maximium of 25 years.The exact loan amount, interest rate, and repayment terms are determined based on a contract signed between the applicant and the Establishment, taking into account the applicant‚Äôs income and repayment capacity.To apply for housing support, Dubai citizens must go through a simple digital process, designed to ensure that all necessary information is gathered efficiently.For those unsure about which option to apply for, the Mohammed bin Rashid Housing Establishment provides advisory support to guide applicants through the process.The Mohammed bin Rashid Housing Establishment offers a variety of grants and loans designed to meet the diverse needs of Dubai citizens at various stages of their housing journey.Each type of grant or loan has specific conditions, such as repayment terms for loans and technical requirements for construction. Applicants are encouraged to carefully review the guidelines to ensure they meet all criteria.The Mohammed bin Rashid Housing Establishment is not only focused on providing financial assistance but also aims to promote sustainable housing solutions. Recently, the Foundation launched a training initiative aimed at educating citizens on efficient and sustainable housing construction. Participants were provided with:This initiative is part of the Establishment's broader effort to empower citizens with the knowledge to make informed decisions about their housing options.","Dubai provides housing grants and loans to citizens for construction, renovation, and home purchases based on income and eligibility.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‚Äòultimate beneficiary name‚Äô, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API ‚Äì the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.‚ÄúThis change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,‚Äù NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. ‚ÄúThis step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,‚Äù said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store‚Äôs brand name or any custom label.‚ÄúThis will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,‚Äù said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, ‚ÄúIt helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.‚ÄùBy standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‚Äòultimate beneficiary name‚Äô The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here‚Äôs a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Tesla‚Äôs former engineer to lead the AI platform

Trump administration seems to go in in full startup mode

Experts worried about security concerns

The Trump administration's plan to integrate artificial intelligence across all federal agencies was accidentally exposed through a GitHub repository before being hastily removed, revealing a July 4 launch date for a new AI.gov platform designed to automate government operations.The GitHub repository vanished shortly after reporters began asking questions, though it was later found archived in GSA's project collection. The AI.gov domain currently redirects to whitehouse.gov.The leaked repository, discovered by multiple observers and first reported by 404 Media, showed the General Services Administration (GSA) developing a ""whole-of-government, AI-first strategy"" under the leadership of Thomas Shedd , a former Tesla engineering manager now heading the Technology Transformation Services.The AI.gov platform will feature three core components: an AI-powered chatbot, an ""all-in-one API"" connecting agencies to models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, and a monitoring system called ""CONSOLE"" that tracks real-time AI usage across government departments.Shedd, described as an Elon Musk ally, reportedly wants GSA to ""operate like a software startup"" and has pushed for AI tools that other agencies will be required to use. The staging site revealed integration plans with Amazon Bedrock, Meta's LLaMA, and various FedRAMP-certified vendors, though some listed models appear to lack proper government certification.Internal government reaction to the AI push has been ""pretty unanimously negative,"" according to federal employees who expressed concerns about security vulnerabilities and the potential for AI to introduce bugs into critical systems or recommend terminating essential contracts.The leaked documentation shows CONSOLE will monitor how employees use AI tools and track their preferences, raising questions about workplace surveillance. Experts warn that widespread AI adoption could create significant security risks as these systems process confidential data and personally identifiable citizen information.The July 4 launch date, as seen on the website, suggests that the Trump administration plans to accelerate AI integration as part of broader government efficiency initiatives championed by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.","The GitHub repository was accidentally exposed, revealing a July 4 launch date for a new AI.gov platform designed to automate government operations.

Written by Steve Jobs: Three 'most-important' words of Apple philosophy that define the company since almost past 50 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/written-by-steve-jobs-three-most-important-words-of-apple-philosophy-that-define-the-company-since-almost-past-50-years/articleshow/121893338.cms,"The Apple Marketing Philosophy by Steve Jobs

Inside 'The Apple Marketing Philosophy': The 'three words' that still shapes every big decision

1. Empathy



2. Focus



3. Impute



Apple‚Äôs secret? Three words that still run the show

Why these three words still matter in a noisy world

In a world where technology evolves faster than most companies can catch up, Apple's staying power isn't just impressive ‚Äî it's historic. From revolutionizing personal computing to reimagining how we communicate, work, and listen to music, Apple has shaped nearly every corner of modern life. But behind every product launch, keynote, and sleek design lies a foundational philosophy that has remained unchanged for almost five decades.It all began in 1977, not with a marketing campaign or a product blueprint, but with a memo. A short, 88-word document that captured the soul of a company still finding its place in a chaotic tech landscape. Though it was penned by Apple‚Äôs early investor and chairman Mike Markkula, it would come to be embraced and embodied most powerfully by co-founder Steve Jobs . These three deceptively simple words ‚Äî Empathy, Focus, and Impute ‚Äî have defined Apple ever since.And perhaps more remarkably, they still do.The document, known as The Apple Marketing Philosophy, was not an abstract corporate vision statement. It was a hands-on guide ‚Äî direct, sharp, and actionable. It didn‚Äôt talk about profits, market share, or competition. Instead, it drilled into how Apple should think, behave, and communicate ‚Äî both internally and with the world.It was a set of principles that Steve Jobs not only internalized but used as a compass every time Apple faced a critical decision.Let‚Äôs break down the three words that have become Apple‚Äôs north star.Apple‚Äôs first priority has never been what‚Äôs trending ‚Äî it‚Äôs what the customer truly needs, even if they can‚Äôt articulate it. That‚Äôs what Empathy means in the Apple context. It‚Äôs not just listening to feedback or conducting user surveys. It‚Äôs putting yourself so completely in the shoes of your users that you anticipate their wants before they do.Steve Jobs was a master of this. He famously said, ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt know what they want until you show it to them.‚Äù That was never arrogance ‚Äî it was insight. Apple‚Äôs approach has always been: meet human need before technical spec.Empathy explains why the iPod wasn‚Äôt just another MP3 player ‚Äî it was a music revolution. Why the iPhone didn‚Äôt just add a touchscreen ‚Äî it redefined the phone entirely. It‚Äôs why Apple software feels intuitive, even to a child, and why its hardware often ‚Äújust works.‚ÄùOne of the hardest disciplines in business is knowing what not to do. That‚Äôs where Apple‚Äôs second guiding word comes in. Focus has been Steve Jobs‚Äô personal mantra and a defining principle of Apple‚Äôs product philosophy.Focus is why Apple never drowned itself in a dozen product lines. When Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, the company had a confusing sprawl of products. His first major act was to cut 70% of them. The result? A simplified product grid ‚Äî desktop and portable, for consumers and pros ‚Äî that laid the foundation for Apple's modern dominance.Focus doesn‚Äôt mean limiting ambition. It means channeling it. Every ounce of Apple‚Äôs creative energy is poured into a small number of products, each of which is obsessively crafted. That‚Äôs why updates take longer. That‚Äôs why features are rolled out only when Apple believes they‚Äôre truly ready. And that‚Äôs why users trust them.In Markkula‚Äôs words: ‚ÄúPeople DO judge a book by its cover.‚Äù And Apple has always known this better than anyone. The idea behind Impute is simple but profound ‚Äî every interaction with a product, from packaging to advertising to interface design, sends a signal. That signal must always reflect care, quality, and thoughtfulness.When Steve Jobs returned to Apple, he didn‚Äôt just focus on tech specs. He obsessed over font choices, box design, and store layouts. Because if a product looks cheap or cluttered, it will feel that way ‚Äî regardless of how powerful it is inside.Impute is the reason why Apple Stores feel more like design museums than retail outlets. Why unboxing a new iPhone feels like an event. Why even the inside of a Mac is sometimes as beautiful as the outside. The message is clear: what you see is a reflection of what‚Äôs underneath.Nearly five decades later, Apple remains fiercely loyal to these three words. Not because of nostalgia, but because they work. When Steve Jobs passed, many wondered if Apple would drift. But the continued success of the iPhone, the rise of the Apple Watch, the evolution of Macs, and the company's growing dominance in services all suggest otherwise.Every major Apple move ‚Äî from their push into custom silicon with the M-series chips to their cautious and considered rollout of Vision Pro ‚Äî can be traced back to these principles. Empathy for how people really want to use technology. Focus on a narrow, high-quality product line. And Impute, ensuring that everything from keynote slides to App Store icons exudes intention and design clarity.In 2025, the tech industry is louder than ever. Artificial intelligence is reshaping entire sectors. Mixed reality is beginning to enter the mainstream. New gadgets appear and vanish in the blink of an eye. And yet, Apple remains not only relevant ‚Äî but aspirational.That‚Äôs no accident. It‚Äôs because these three words are more than a philosophy. They are a filter. A way to cut through hype, avoid distractions, and deliver lasting value.For any company wondering how to endure, inspire, and lead ‚Äî the answer isn‚Äôt in chasing the latest trend. It‚Äôs in embracing a few timeless truths. And if they‚Äôre lucky, they‚Äôll write them down on one sheet of paper, just like Apple did in 1977.","The Apple Marketing Philosophy was written by co-founder Steve Jobs in 1977.

What took Google engineers hours to fix the issue and the way forward

Google apologises for the outage

Google has apologised for a major outage recently that impacted services running on Google Cloud across the globe recently. The widespread outage disrupted over 70 Google Cloud services, bringing down major third-party platforms like Cloudflare, OpenAI, and Shopify, as well as Google‚Äôs own products, including Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, and Google Meet.In an incident report released late Friday (June 17), the company said, ""Google Cloud, Google Workspace and Google Security Operations products experienced increased 503 errors in external API requests, impacting customers."" Google attributed the hours-long downtime to a series of flawed updates, particularly a new ‚Äúquota policy checks‚Äù feature introduced in May. The feature, designed to evaluate automated incoming requests, was not adequately tested in real-world scenarios. This led to blank entries being sent across all Google Cloud data centers, triggering widespread system crashes.""On May 29, 2025, a new feature was added to Service Control for additional quota policy checks. This code change and binary release went through our region by region rollout, but the code path that failed was never exercised during this rollout due to needing a policy change that would trigger the code. As a safety precaution, this code change came with a red-button to turn off that particular policy serving path. The issue with this change was that it did not have appropriate error handling nor was it feature flag protected. Without the appropriate error handling, the null pointer caused the binary to crash. Feature flags are used to gradually enable the feature region by region per project, starting with internal projects, to enable us to catch issues. If this had been flag protected, the issue would have been caught in staging,"" said Google in the Incident report.According to the company, Google engineers identified the issue within 10 minutes, but the outage persisted for seven hours due to overloaded systems in larger regions. Google admitted it failed to use feature flags, a standard industry practice that could have caught the issue during a gradual rollout. "" Within 10 minutes, the root cause was identified and the red-button (to disable the serving path) was being put in place. The red-button was ready to roll out ~25 minutes from the start of the incident. Within 40 minutes of the incident, the red-button rollout was completed, and we started seeing recovery across regions, starting with the smaller ones first. Within some of our larger regions, such as us-central-1, as Service Control tasks restarted, it created a herd effect on the underlying infrastructure it depends on (i.e. that Spanner table), overloading the infrastructure. Service Control did not have the appropriate randomized exponential backoff implemented to avoid this. It took up to ~2h 40 mins to fully resolve in us-central-1 as we throttled task creation to minimize the impact on the underlying infrastructure and routed traffic to multi-regional databases to reduce the load. At that point, Service Control and API serving was fully recovered across all regions. Corresponding Google and Google Cloud products started recovering with some taking longer depending upon their architecture,"" said Google in its Incident Report.To prevent future incidents, Google said it will overhaul its system architecture to ensure operations continue even if one component fails. The company also committed to auditing its systems and improving both automated and human communication channels to keep customers informed during issues.‚ÄúWe deeply apologize for the impact this outage has had,‚Äù Google wrote in the incident report. ‚ÄúGoogle Cloud customers and their users trust their businesses to Google, and we will do better. We apologize for the impact this has had not only on our customers‚Äô businesses and their users but also on the trust of our systems. We are committed to making improvements to help avoid outages like this moving forward.‚ÄùCEO of Google‚Äôs cloud unit Thomas Kurian, also posted about the outage in a Twitter post, saying ‚Äúwe regret the disruption this caused our customers.‚Äù","Google apologised for a major outage that impacted services running on Google Cloud.

Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang says he is waiting for Elon Musk‚Äôs brain chips before having kids,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/scale-ai-founder-alexandr-wang-says-he-is-waiting-for-elon-musks-brain-chips-before-having-kids/articleshow/121892713.cms,"Why Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang is waiting for Neuralink brain chips to have kids



‚ÄúI want to wait to have kids until we figure out how Neuralink or other ways (brain computer interfaces) for brains to interlink with a computer until they start working. There are a few reasons for this. In first seven years of life, your brain is more neuroplastic than at any other point by an order of magnitude.

For example, if a newborn that has cataracts in their eyes, so they can't see through the cataracts and then they live the first seven years of their life with those cataracts. Then when you have them removed they're like eight or nine.

Even with those removed, they're not going to learn how to see because it's so important in those first seven years of your development that you're able to see, that your brain can learn how to read the signals coming off of your eyes.

And if you don't have that until you're eight or nine, then you won't learn how to see, because it's so important that your

neuroplasticity

is so high in that early stage of life.

I think, when we get Neuralink and these other technologies, kids who are born with them are going to learn how to use them in like crazy ways. It'll be like a part of their brain in a way that it'll never be true for an adult who gets a Neuralink or whatever hooked into their brain.‚Äù

Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang has stated that he plans to delay having children until brain-computer interfaces like Neuralink become available. The 28-year-old tech founder and soon-to-be head of Meta‚Äôs superintelligence initiatives, shared this perspective on a recent Shawn Ryan Show episode. His decision highlights his interest in integrating superintelligence into the next generation. Neuralink, a project led by Elon Musk , is developing coin-sized microchips designed for brain implantation. These chips are intended to both record and stimulate brain activity.

8 simple tips to help you improve efficiency of your car‚Äôs AC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/8-simple-tips-to-help-you-improve-efficiency-of-your-cars-ac/articleshow/121792931.cms,"8 simple tips to improve your car‚Äôs AC

Park in the shade

Vent hot air before starting AC

Use the Recirculation Mode

Don't keep it on max fan speed constantly

Get regular AC servicing

Clean or replace air filters

Use a sunshade

Turn off AC before turning off engine

As temperatures soar, a well-functioning car air conditioner becomes less of a luxury and more of a necessity. However, many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC‚Äôs efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling. A few simple practices can significantly improve its efficiency, save fuel, and extend the life of your cooling system. By incorporating these simple habits, you can ensure your car's AC runs more efficiently, keeping you comfortable while potentially saving on fuel costs and maintenance. Here are eight simple tips to help you stay cool on the road.This might seem obvious, but parking under a tree or in a covered area can make a huge difference. A car parked in direct sunlight can reach internal temperatures far exceeding the outside air, forcing your AC to work much harder to cool it down.Before turning on your AC, roll down your windows for a minute or two, especially if your car has been sitting in the sun. This allows trapped hot air to escape, reducing the initial load on your air conditioning system.Once your car is cool, switch your AC to recirculation mode. This feature re-circulates the air already inside the cabin, rather than constantly trying to cool hot outside air. This is much more efficient and helps maintain a comfortable temperature.While it's tempting to use the highest fan setting, keeping it on maximum continuously isn't always the most efficient. Once the cabin is cool, reduce the fan speed to maintain comfort, which puts less strain on the system.Just like your car's engine, your AC system needs regular maintenance. Getting it serviced annually ensures that refrigerant levels are optimal, components are clean, and there are no leaks. A well-maintained system runs more efficiently.A clogged cabin air filter can restrict airflow and make your AC work harder. Check your car's manual for recommended replacement intervals and clean or replace the filter as needed. This simple step can dramatically improve airflow and efficiency.When parking outdoors, a reflective sunshade in your windshield can significantly reduce the internal temperature build-up. This minimises the initial cooling effort required from your AC.It's a good habit to turn off your AC a few minutes before you reach your destination or turn off the engine. This allows the system to dry out, preventing mold and mildew growth in the vents, which can lead to unpleasant odours and reduce efficiency over time.","Many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC‚Äôs efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling.

Microsoft has disabled a 'key feature' to enhance Windows security,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-has-disabled-a-key-feature-to-enhance-windows-security/articleshow/121891649.cms,"How Windows Hello technology works



HP EliteBook Ultra G1i Review: Thin, light, power in a premium package

Microsoft has enhanced the security of the Windows operating system but for that it has disabled a crucial feature. The company has quietly updated Windows Hello 's face unlock feature, which now prevents it from working in dark rooms. As per the tech giant, this isn't a bug but a deliberate change made in April to patch a serious spoofing vulnerability. While the fix enhances security, it removes a key functionality many Windows 11 users relied on.The change, spotted by Windows Central, has been noted by some Surface Laptop users who claimed that they can no longer use their face to sign into their laptop in a dark room.‚ÄúAfter installing this update or a later Windows update, for enhanced security, Windows Hello facial recognition requires color cameras to see a visible face when signing in,‚Äù says Microsoft in its April Windows Update patch notes.Windows Hello leverages a combination of both colour cameras and infrared (IR) sensors, allowing for authentication even in complete darkness.The vulnerability was discovered by researchers at Nanyang Technological University‚ÄúAutomated recognition mechanism with inadequate detection or handling of adversarial input perturbations in Windows Hello allows an unauthorized attacker to perform spoofing locally,‚Äù the researchers said.The flaw was rated ""important"" by Microsoft, though the company noted it was ""less likely"" to be exploited by malicious actors locally on a device, and it has not been publicly disclosed or exploited.Meanwhile, for users who rely heavily on dark-room unlocking, a temporary workaround exists: disabling the webcam in Windows 11's Device Manager. However, there is a catch. This 'change' by users renders the camera unusable for all other applications, including video calls, making it an impractical solution for most users and a clear trade-off between convenience and security.","Microsoft has quietly updated Windows Hello's face unlock feature, which now prevents it from working in dark rooms.

Why Meta's models are reproducing exact text



What this means for Meta



Facebook parent Meta ‚Äôs newest AI model, Llama 3.1, has been found to replicate passages from well-known books, including Harry Potter, far more frequently than anticipated, as per a new report which also says that many of these works remain under copyright. Researchers claim that the AI has memorised roughly 42% of the first Harry Potter book and can accurately reproduce 50-word sections about half the time. The study, conducted by experts from Stanford, Cornell, and West Virginia University, examined how five leading AI models processed the Books3 dataset, which includes thousands of copyrighted titles.""Llama 3.1 70B‚Äîa mid-sized model Meta released in July 2024‚Äîis far more likely to reproduce Harry Potter text than any of the other four models, the researchers found ""Interestingly, Llama 1 65B, a similar-sized model released in February 2023, had memorized only 4.4 percent of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. This suggests that despite the potential legal liability, Meta did not do much to prevent memorization as it trained Llama 3. At least for this book, the problem got much worse between Llama 1 and Llama 3,"" the researchers wrote.Meta‚Äôs Llama 3.1 has been noted for retaining large portions of well-known books, including The Hobbit, 1984, and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer‚Äôs Stone. In contrast, earlier versions, such as Llama 1, only memorized around 4% of Harry Potter. This suggests that the newer model is preserving significantly more copyrighted content.Researchers suggest several reasons why Meta's AI models may be copying text verbatim. One possibility is that the same books were repeatedly used during training, reinforcing memorisation rather than generalising language patterns.Others speculate that training data could include excerpts from fan websites, reviews, or academic papers, leading the model to inadvertently retain copyrighted content. Additionally, adjustments to the training process may have amplified this issue without developers realizing the extent of its impact.These findings intensify concerns about how AI models are trained and whether they might be violating copyright laws. As authors and publishers push back against unauthorised use of their work, this could become a major challenge for tech companies like Meta.Earlier this year, The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement, alleging that their AI models, including ChatGPT, were trained on copyrighted articles without permission. According to the Times, OpenAI, ‚Äúcan generate output that recites Times' content verbatim, closely summarizes it, and mimics its expressive style.‚Äù It said that the AI company essentially stole their intellectual property.","Llama 3.1 has been noted for retaining large portions of well-known books, including The Hobbit, 1984, and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer‚Äôs Stone.

Gabriella Zuniga‚Äôs explicit content offer raises public and legal questions

Legal teams release conflicting evidence in heated court battle

Career fallout and postponed projects for Shannon Sharpe







The legal battle between former NFL star Shannon Sharpe and OnlyFans creator Gabriella Zuniga has taken an even more sensational turn. Zuniga, also known online as ""Karli,"" is now offering a s*x tape to subscribers who tip over $2,000‚Äîdespite being in the midst of a $50 million lawsuit against Sharpe, which includes serious allegations of sexual assault, emotional abuse, and coercion.At just 21 years old, OnlyFans star Gabriella Zuniga‚Äôs decision to promote adult content while pursuing a high-profile legal case has ignited a firestorm of debate online. Critics argue her move could damage her credibility and shift public perception of the lawsuit. Supporters counter that she‚Äôs continuing her career as an adult content creator, independent of the case at hand.Notably, Gabriella Zuniga has not confirmed whether the tape involves Sharpe, a point that adds ambiguity and intrigue to an already explosive case. Given the legal implications, it seems unlikely she would directly tie the content to the former athlete, though the timing of her announcement has undeniably complicated the narrative.Represented by high-profile attorney Tony Buzbee‚Äîknown for taking on Deshaun Watson and Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs‚ÄîZuniga alleges a disturbing pattern of manipulation by Sharpe. This includes claims of non-consensual recordings and threats of violence.Buzbee released audio recordings in which Sharpe allegedly states he would ""choke"" her, painting a picture of abuse behind the scenes.Sharpe, 56, has firmly denied all allegations through his lawyer, Lanny Davis, calling the lawsuit ‚Äúan extortion attempt.‚Äù In response, Davis released explicit messages that appear to show a consensual relationship between the two. One message reportedly even features Zuniga expressing a desire to have Sharpe‚Äôs child.According to court documents, the two met at a Los Angeles gym in 2023, when Zuniga was just 19. She claims their relationship evolved from flirtation to deep emotional and psychological distress.The scandal has already had serious career repercussions for Sharpe.
