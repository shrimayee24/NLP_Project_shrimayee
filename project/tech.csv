Where to Watch Pre-Season Testing?



As the 2025 Formula 1 season approaches, anticipation is building for the first race in Melbourne, Australia, on March 16. Before the excitement officially begins, fans and teams alike are turning their attention to pre-season testing, which offers a sneak peek at what to expect from the upcoming championship. But what exactly is pre-season testing, and can it reveal who might dominate the 2025 F1 season?Pre-season testing, scheduled from February 26 to 28, is a crucial three-day event that allows teams and drivers to become familiar with their new cars at an official F1 race circuit. After months of designing and refining their vehicles, this is the first real chance to see how they perform under race conditions. Although data from simulators provides valuable insights, nothing compares to the on-track experience offered by pre-season testing.During this period, teams experiment with different car setups, assess the impact of newly introduced parts, and gather essential data to guide further development. It is common for cars to undergo significant changes between testing and the first race, as teams adjust based on their findings. This testing phase is not just about speed but also about reliability, balance, and how the car reacts to various track conditions.Pre-season testing will take place at the Bahrain International Circuit in Sakhir, Bahrain, from February 26 to 28, with sessions running from 10 am to 7 pm local time (GMT +3) and a lunch break from 2 pm to 3 pm. This venue, known for its mix of high and low-speed corners and long straights, has been a favorite testing ground since 2009, offering a comprehensive challenge to drivers.Bahrain's reliable weather conditions provide a consistent baseline for teams, allowing them to fine-tune their cars effectively. The forecast indicates cloudy skies with temperatures around 17°C, creating optimal testing conditions.Fans can catch all the action through F1 TV Pro, which offers live access to every angle and in-depth analysis.

"Jon Stewart’s ‘bloody’ rant: Comedian smashes mug, cuts hand while slamming Biden and Musk’s DOGE",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jon-stewarts-bloody-rant-comedian-smashes-mug-cuts-hand-while-slamming-biden-and-musks-doge/articleshow/118564550.cms,"Stewart smashed the mug on his desk as a clip of Biden played onscreen.

The veteran host Jon Stewart took his signature outrage to a new level Tuesday night—literally drawing blood during an explosive segment on The Daily Show .Playing a mock employee of Elon Musk ’s Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), Stewart brought out a calculator and a “World’s Most Dad” mug—a pointed jab at Musk’s ever-expanding family—before setting his sights on government waste. But when he turned his fury on Joe Biden’s modest prescription drug negotiations, things took a painful turn.“F—king thanks! Come on!” Stewart shouted, smashing the mug on his desk as a clip of Biden played onscreen. Moments later, he winced, hiding his hand under the desk before admitting, “I’ll be going to the hospital soon.”When he finally revealed his injury, the audience gasped at the sight of blood. “It’s fine!” he reassured them with a grin. Later, he promoted the episode as a “bloody good” one, quipping, “Emphasis on the bloody. I’m an idiot.”Beyond the theatrics, Stewart argued that DOGE was “cutting in the wrong places,” calling out corporate subsidies instead. “We’re getting f—cked at a Diddy party, and they’re making us buy the baby oil,” he cracked, referencing the embattled rapper’s legal troubles.He ended with an attempt at a MAGA-style slogan: Make America Not Governed In Obviously Negative—only to panic when he realized it spelled “MANGION,” one letter shy of UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter Luigi Mangione.“Oh! Abort, abort, abort,” he yelled, before urging action: “I’m kidding—no vigilantes. But do something!”","The veteran host took his signature outrage to a new level Tuesday night.

Apple to fix iPhone dictation bug that briefly typed 'Trump' instead of 'racist',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/apple-to-fix-iphone-dictation-bug-that-briefly-types-trump-instead-of-racist/articleshow/118570275.cms,"Apple is addressing a peculiar glitch in its automatic dictation feature after some iPhone users reported that the word “racist” momentarily appeared as “Trump” before correcting itself. The issue, which sparked controversy after a viral TikTok post, has led to accusations of political bias against the tech giant.The problem was replicated multiple times and appeared to stem from phonetic similarities between the two words, according to an Apple spokesperson. “We are aware of an issue with the speech recognition model that powers Dictation and we are rolling out a fix today,” the company said in a statement.Artificial intelligence expert John Burkey, a former member of Apple’s Siri team, suggested that the glitch might not have been purely technical. “This smells like a serious prank,” Burkey said. “The only question is: Did someone slip this into the data or slip into the code?” He noted that the issue arose after a server update but doubted that Apple’s AI training data was the root cause.The controversy follows Apple’s recent struggles with AI-powered features. Last month, the company disabled a key function of its Apple Intelligence system after it generated inaccurate news summaries. In 2018, Siri faced backlash when it briefly displayed a nude image in response to a question about Donald Trump, an issue linked to Wikipedia edits.The latest glitch surfaced shortly after Apple announced a $500 billion investment in the US over the next four years, including plans to manufacture AI servers at a new facility in Houston. The commitment came after Apple CEO Tim Cook met with President Donald Trump last week, reaffirming the company’s pledge to boost domestic investments.","Apple's automatic dictation feature appeared to mistake the word ""racist"" for ""Trump"" The company is rolling out a fix to fix the problem.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk reacted with surprise after a post on X by Conservative activist Christopher R Rofo alleged that officials from the NSA and CIA discussed raising intersex babies as non-binary to advance ""trans ideology.""The post, which contained an image of an alleged chat between intelligence officials, included a message stating, “An intersex birth would be a great opportunity to raise a kid as non-binary and let them choose later.” Rofo claimed this was evidence that intelligence agencies were pushing a political agenda, calling them ""insane.""Musk responded to the post with a brief but pointed reaction: “Wow.” His comment quickly gained traction among his followers, many of whom debated the implications of the alleged chat.The authenticity of the chat logs remains unverified.

Conclave wins best film at BAFTAs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/conclave-wins-best-picture-at-baftas-as-the-brutalist-takes-directing-and-acting-prizes/articleshow/118310797.cms,"LONDON: Papal thriller “ Conclave ” won four prizes including best picture on Sunday at the 78th British Academy Film Awards , where genre-bending musical “ Emilia Pérez ” proved that it’s still an awards contender despite a multipronged backlash that looked to have dented its chances.“The Brutalist” equaled the awards tally of “Conclave,"" scooping four trophies, including best director for Brady Corbet and best actor for Adrien Brody. Mikey Madison won the best actress prize for Brooklyn tragicomedy “Anora.”“Conclave,” which stars Ralph Fiennes as a cardinal corralling conniving clergy as they elect a new pope, beat “The Brutalist,” “Emilia Pérez,” Bob Dylan biopic “ A Complete Unknown "" to the top prize. ""Conclave” was also named outstanding British film and took trophies for editing and adapted screenplay.Supporting performer prizes went to Kieran Culkin for “A Real Pain” and Zoe Saldaña for “Emilia Pérez,"" which also won the award for best film not in the English language.Saldaña won for her role as a lawyer who helps the title character transition to a woman and out of a life of crime. She called the film “the creative challenge of a lifetime.”Best actress nominee Karla Sofía Gascón, who stars as the titular transgender ex-cartel boss in “Emilia Pérez,” wasn’t at the ceremony. Gascón has withdrawn from promoting the film, which has 13 Oscar nominations, amid controversy over her social media posts disparaging Muslims, George Floyd and diversity at the Oscars.Audiard has condemned those comments, but in his acceptance speech thanked Gascón and her co-stars Saldaña and Selena Gomez.“I am deeply proud of what we have all achieved together,"" he said.From the BAFTAs to the OscarsStars including Cynthia Erivo, Hugh Grant, Ariana Grande, Lupita Nyong’o, Timothée Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan walked the red carpet at London’s Royal Festival Hall for the awards, known as BAFTAs.The prizes will be watched for clues about who will triumph at Hollywood’s Academy Awards on March 2, in an unusually hard-to-call awards season.They also have a distinctly British accent. The ceremony kicked off with its kilt-wearing host, Scottish actor David Tennant, leading the audience in a rousing singalong of The Proclaimers’ anthem “I’m Gonna be (500 Miles).”Culkin's award came for “A Real Pain,” about odd couple cousins on a trip to explore their roots. The film's writer and co-star, Jesse Eisenberg, took the BAFTA for best original screenplay.“I’d like to share this with my wife, who didn’t come because she didn’t think I’d win,” Eisenberg quipped.“Anora,” about an exotic dancer entangled with a Russian oligarch's son, had been a best picture favorite after winning the top prizes last week at the Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards.“The Brutalist” had nine BAFTA nominations, while “Anora,” the sci-fi epic “Dune: Part Two” and musical “Wicked” hade seven each. “A Complete Unknown” and Irish-language hip-hop drama “Kneecap” received six nominations apiece.Brody won over stiff competition from Fiennes and Chalamet, who plays the young Dylan in “A Complete Unknown.” The other male actors nominated were Grant for his creepy role in the horror film “ Heretic,” Colman Domingo in real-life prison drama “ Sing Sing ” and Sebastian Stan for his portrayal of a young Donald Trump in “ The Apprentice.”Stan, who is also Oscar nominated, said it was “incredibly validating” to get recognition for the film, which initially struggled to find an American distributor. It's an origins story that focuses on Trump's relationship with ruthless power broker Roy Cohn, played by Jeremy Strong.“We were told this was going to be a thankless job that was never going to lead to anything,” Stan said, describing the movie as a “fair” depiction of the president.Best-actress nominees were Madison, Gascón, Demi Moore for body-horror film “ The Substance,” Ronan for “The Outrun,” Erivo for “Wicked” and Marianne Jean-Baptiste for the Mike Leigh drama “Hard Truths.” Erivo or Jean-Baptiste would have been the first non-white performer to win the leading actress BAFTA.Animated caper “Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl” won awards for best animated feature and best family and children’s film.Sci-fi epic “Dune: Part Two” won prizes for sound and visual effects. “The Brutalist” won for cinematography and musical score. Musical “Wicked” took the costume and production design trophies.Rising stars and lifetime honorsBritain’s film academy introduced changes to increase the awards’ diversity in 2020, when no women were nominated as best director for the seventh year running and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white.Most winners are chosen by 8,000 members of the U.K. academy of industry professionals, with one — the Rising Star Award —- selected by public vote from a shortlist of nominees. This year's winner was David Jonsson, star of high finance drama series “Industry” and London rom-com “Rye Lane.”“Star, I don’t know,” he said. “But rising, I guess.”“Willow” and “Return of the Jedi” actor Warwick Davis received the academy’s top honor, the BAFTA Fellowship, for his screen career and work to create a more inclusive film industry.He founded a talent agency for actors under 5 feet tall, because, he said, “short actors weren’t known for their talent, just their height.”BAFTA chairwoman Sara Putt sent a message of strength to everyone hit by last month’s devastating Los Angeles wildfires. Jamie Lee Curtis, a supporting actress nominee for “The Last Showgirl,” was absent because the fires delayed filming on her current work.The event was without a dash of royal glamour this year. Neither Prince William, who is honorary president of the British film academy, nor his wife Kate are attending. The awards coincide with school holidays for their three children.William, 42, sent a recorded video message that was played before the presentation of the Rising Star Award.","Papal thriller ""Conclave "" wins four prizes including best picture.

Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic. In his memoir, Spare, the Duke of Sussex talks about reaching out to a medium with supernatural abilities to communicate with Diana, who passed away in a car accident in Paris in 1997, just before his 13th birthday, The Mirror reported.The Duke received a message from his mother through the psychic, who told him, ""You're living the life she wanted for you."" Harry, now 40, says that the medium also told him his mother was with him ""right now,"" which made his neck warm and his eyes fill with tears. The psychic shared that Diana knew Harry was ""looking for clarity"" and ""feels your confusion."" She added that Diana understood Harry had ""so many questions"" and that answers would come in time.Another anecdote involved Prince Harry’s son, Archie. The psychic reportedly described how Diana’s spirit witnessed Archie accidentally breaking a Christmas tree ornament shaped like Queen Elizabeth. When asked, Harry admitted the incident had occurred, adding that Archie had attempted to fix the ornament.The medium suggested Diana found humour in the situation, delighting in the antics of her grandson she never had the chance to meet.In Spare, Prince Harry also recounts an extraordinary encounter with a leopard during a trip to Botswana with his brother, Prince William. He interpreted the animal’s presence as a comforting sign from his late mother, suggesting that ""everything will be fine."" However, the experience was not without fear, as he briefly worried the leopard might attack.Harry has been candid about the psychological toll of losing Diana so young. As reported by The Mirror, he disclosed a haunting period after her death when he entertained the possibility that she had staged her demise. His anguish led him to repeatedly drive through the Paris tunnel where Diana’s life was cut short, attempting to make sense of the tragedy.","Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic.

"'Tug of War,' 'Manhandled': Donald Trump- Emmanuel Macron’s handshake outside Oval Office sparks online buzz",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tug-of-war-manhandled-donald-trump-emmanuel-macrons-handshake-outside-oval-office-sparks-online-buzz/articleshow/118553479.cms,"A prolonged handshake between US President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House has gone viral, with social media users dubbing it a “tug-of-war” moment. The two leaders met on the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, exchanging firm grips and shoulder pats before Trump pulled Macron in closer. The video of their interaction quickly gained traction online, with users dissecting the exchange.The handshake outside the Oval Office, lasting several seconds, became a major talking point, with many calling it “awkward.” The moment reignited discussions about the duo’s past handshakes, particularly their encounters in 2017 and during their 2024 meeting in Paris for the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral. Social media commentator Colin Rugg shared a compilation of these moments, amassing over 300,000 views within hours.One X user commented, “France’s President Emmanuel Macron wasn’t gonna let that weakling Donald Trump try to yank him with his weird handshake. He went on the offense and yanked Donald Trump’s tiny hand first.”Another wrote, “Trump shows America is back on top with his dominant handshake in France. He basically manhandled Macron.”Beyond the handshake, tensions flared during a joint press briefing when Macron interrupted Trump while he was speaking about Europe’s financial support for Ukraine. Trump claimed, “Europe is loaning the money to Ukraine and is getting their money back.” Macron, stopping Trump by grabbing his hand, interjected, “No, in fact. To be frank, we paid. We paid 60% of the total effort.”The exchange sparked further debate online. Some praised Macron for “fact-checking” Trump in real time, while others criticised him for being “impolite” to the host.One user wrote, “Embarrassing picture for the US; Macron is fact-checking Trump. Can't Trump get his info straight? Weren't Presidents of the US once supposed to receive accurate information?” Another added, “In an incredible moment in front of the world, President Macron brutally interrupted a Trump lie, fearlessly fact-checking him in real time. Watch Trump’s embarrassed expression. This is how it’s done.”However, not everyone saw the exchange negatively. A third user commented, “Love the interaction. At least Trump allowed this to be done to himself, a good sign. Not sure the old admin Trump would have responded so well.”The viral handshake and press briefing moment have once again put the Trump-Macron dynamic in the spotlight, proving that their interactions remain a subject of fascination online.","US President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron exchanged a prolonged handshake at the White House.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.
