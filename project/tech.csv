World-famous 'Doge' meme dog Kabosu dies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/world-famous-doge-meme-dog-kabosu-dies/articleshow/110388087.cms,"Kabosu, the dog from the Dogecoin meme (Image credits: X)

NEW DELHI: Kabosu, the beloved Shiba Inu who became an internet sensation as the Doge meme, has passed away. Kabosu’s owner, Atsuko Sato, announced the sad news, stating that Kabosu ""fell into a deep sleep"" at 7:50 am on May 24. A farewell party is scheduled for Sunday at Flower Kaori in Kotsu no Mori, Narita City, from 1 pm to 4 pm.

Kabosu's fame began in 2010 when pictures of her went viral online, leading to the creation of the Doge meme. The meme's popularity skyrocketed and even inspired the creation of Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency launched in 2013 using Kabosu’s image as its logo. Initially conceived as a joke, Dogecoin's success spurred the creation of several other dog-themed cryptocurrencies.

In April last year, Elon Musk briefly changed Twitter's logo to an image of Kabosu, causing a surge in Dogecoin's value. Musk has been an outspoken supporter of the meme-based cryptocurrency.

Kabosu had been diagnosed with cholangiohepatitis and chronic lymphoma leukemia in 2022. Her passing marks the end of an era for meme enthusiasts and the cryptocurrency community.

Australia’s richest woman's demand triggers Streisand Effect,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/gina-rineharts-portrait-australias-richest-woman-streisand-effect/articleshow/110368060.cms,"Australia's richest person, Gina Rinehart , recently attempted to have an unflattering portrait of herself removed from the National Gallery of Australia. Her efforts, however, had the opposite effect, drawing increased attention to the artwork and sparking discussions about art and censorship in Australia.The portrait, created by award-winning Aboriginal painter Vincent Namatjira , is part of his "" Australia in Colour "" series. This series offers a satirical view of 21 influential figures who have shaped Australia, including Rinehart, Queen Elizabeth II, and former Prime Minister Scott Morrison. The caricature-style painting of Rinehart did not sit well with her, prompting her to demand its removal from the gallery. The gallery refused.By making this demand, Rinehart fell victim to the Streisand Effect, named after Barbra Streisand 's unsuccessful attempt in 2003 to suppress aerial photos of her California beach house. The legal battle not only cost Streisand financially but also drew more public interest to the images, a report in the Independent said.Nick Mitzevich, the gallery’s director, expressed his stance on the matter: ""We welcome the public having a dialogue on our collection and displays."" Namatjira added, ""People don’t have to like my paintings, but I hope they take the time to look and think, ‘Why has this Aboriginal bloke painted these powerful people? What is he trying to say?’""Following Rinehart's demand, the painting gained further media coverage, including mentions in several newspapers and on the US talk show ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert."" The National Gallery also reported a noticeable increase in visitors, according to The Guardian.Rinehart's attempt to censor the portrait led to scrutiny of her beliefs and the reasons behind her inclusion in Namatjira’s series. Her father, Lang Hancock, who founded Hancock Prospecting, was criticized for his controversial views on mining on Aboriginal land. Rinehart herself has been known for her outspoken opinions, once suggesting that people should ""spend less time drinking or smoking and socializing, and more time working"" to become wealthier.Namatjira's exhibition, including the controversial portrait of Rinehart, will remain on display at the National Gallery of Australia until its closing date on July 21, 2024","Australia's richest person, Gina Rinehart, tried to have an unflattering portrait of herself removed from the National Gallery of Australia.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Scenario 1 – Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction within the same billing cycle Purchase transaction date – October 15, 2023 As bill is yet to be generated in the given case, the refund amount received on October 19, 2023, shall be adjusted with other debits, prior to calculation of the Total Amount Due. Refund on October 19, 2023 - For cancellation of purchase dated October 15, 2023 Scenario 2 – Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction post generation of bill but before making payment of the dues Purchase transaction date - October 29, 2023 The bill is generated on October 30, 2023, however, the payment towards the dues has not been made till the date of refund. Therefore, the refund amount received on November 04, 2023, shall be adjusted towards the Total Amount Due (TAD) and accordingly the cardholder will be required to pay only the remaining outstanding (Remaining outstanding = TAD – Refund amount). Scenario 3 – Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction for which payment has already been made Purchase transaction date - October 30, 2023 As the cardholder has already cleared the dues, card-issuers shall seek explicit consent of the cardholder to adjust the refund amount in line with the provision stipulated at Para 10(h) of the MD. Payment towards dues – November 06, 2023 Case I - If the cardholder gives explicit consent, then refund amount shall be adjusted. Refund on November 07, 2023 - For cancellation of purchase dated October 30, 2023 Case II - If the cardholder does not provide the consent or no response is received for adjustment of the refund, then the refund amount will be credited to the bank account of the cardholder in line with para 10(h). Further, if the cardholder makes a request for crediting the refund (transaction for which payment has already been made), the same shall be credited back to the bank account of the cardholder irrespective of the cut off defined under Para10(h).

Scenario 2

Purchase transaction date: October 29, 2023

Refund or reversal occurs after the bill is generated but before the payment due date (November 19, 2023).

Credit cards offer a convenient means to manage finances and enhance financial well-being. By using credit cards responsibly, individuals can build a positive credit history and improve their financial habits. It's important to use credit cards for expenses while ensuring timely repayment of debts to boost credit scores.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently introduced amendments effective from March 7, 2024, alongside releasing updated FAQs regarding credit and debit card issuance.One important question addressed in the FAQs is whether a credit card can be used beyond its sanctioned limit, with over-limit charges imposed, states an ET report. According to RBI guidelines, using a credit card beyond the approved limit (overlimit) necessitates explicit consent from the cardholder. Furthermore, cardholders must have the option to enable or disable the overlimit feature through various platforms provided by the card issuer. Without explicit consent, neither overlimit facilities can be extended nor overlimit charges levied.Here are some key FAQs derived from the Master Direction (MD) - Credit Card and Debit Card – Issuance and Conduct Directions, 2022:Card issuers cannot send credit cards without the customer's permission. If a customer gets an unsolicited card, they should not activate it or agree to its activation. If they don't consent, the issuer must close the credit card account within seven working days at no cost to the customer. The issuer will inform the customer about the closure. After that, the customer should destroy the card. If needed, the customer can complain to the issuer and escalate the issue to the RBI Ombudsman.If a cardholder fails to pay the total amount due by the payment due date, they will lose the interest-free credit period. Interest may be charged from the transaction date on the outstanding amount (adjusted for payments, refunds, or reversed transactions) and not the total due amount. Late payment fees and other charges will only apply to the outstanding amount after the payment due date, not the total amount due.Paragraphs 7(b) and 7(c) of the MD allow the issuance of different types of credit cards that can tap into the limits of various loan accounts. These cards are tailored to match the terms and conditions of the specific loan account. For instance, if a customer has an overdraft facility, they can receive a credit card to access the funds from that facility. The terms of use for this credit card, including interest rates, repayment schedules, penalties, and cash withdrawal limits, will mirror those of the overdraft facility.Additionally, paragraph 7(c) gives card issuers the flexibility to design Business Credit Cards according to their credit card policies. However, it's important to note that banks are not allowed to issue debit cards for cash credit or loan accounts.Which transactions can be used to reduce the amount owed and credited to the cardholder's bank account?In a standard credit card cycle from October 1, 2023, to October 30, 2023, assuming the bill is issued on October 30, 2023, and payment is due by November 19, 2023, here are the possible scenarios for adjusting credit:Activation of a credit card is confirmed through customer-initiated actions such as PIN generation, adjusting transaction controls, Interactive Voice Response, contacting customer care through recorded calls, or SMS communication. If the card remains inactive for more than 30 days from the date of issue, the card issuer must request One Time Password (OTP) based consent, as outlined in paragraph 6(a)(vi) of the MD.For business credit cards applied for by a corporate or business entity, card issuers must obtain explicit consent from the principal account holder, as specified in paragraph 6(a)(vi). Similarly, they must send notifications as per paragraph 8(b). This consent should come from the principal cardholder, unless otherwise stated in the agreement. Likewise, for retail credit cards, consent must be obtained from the principal cardholder, not from any add-on cardholders.Card issuers are not permitted to apply interest or other charges to unpaid taxes, levies, or charges. This provision, outlined in paragraph 9(b)(ii) of the MD, took effect from October 1, 2022. Therefore, card issuers cannot apply such charges to any unpaid taxes, levies, or charges billed from that date onwards.Regarding transactions eligible for adjustment towards outstanding dues and credited to the cardholder's bank account, let's consider a typical credit card billing cycle from October 1, 2023, to October 30, 2023. Assume the bill is generated on October 30, 2023, with a payment due date of November 19, 2023. Here are the different scenarios:- Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction within the same billing cycle:- Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction post-generation of bill but before making payment of the dues:","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently introduced amendments effective from March 7, 2024, alongside releasing updated FAQs regarding credit and debit card issuance.

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal. The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108805388,imgsize-32690,width-400,resizemode-4/108805388.jpg"
Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy . Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision. The US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.

OpenAI strikes deal with News Corp

Facebook-parent Meta is reportedly considering paying news organisations to better train its AI language models as it looks to make its generative AI tools, including Meta AI , more effective and competitive in the market of generative AI search tools as well as chatbots offered by Google and Microsoft .Citing two people familiar with the considerations, a report by Business Insider said that teams within the company are discussing internally whether to strike deals with news publishers for more access to news, photo, and video content.“Meta may be forced to pay someone,” said one of the sources.Meta, however, has not yet approached any news outlets about licensing content, and internal talks are ongoing. Any deals for data access for model training would be separate from past agreements where Meta paid publishers to host links on its sites.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has claimed that his company has its own data for training its Llama models that is larger than Common Crawl, a massive set of scraped web data used widely (including by Meta) for AI model training.However, there are concerns internally about the quality of that owned data, one of the people familiar said. For example, compared to books, news articles and essays, posts and comments on Facebook or Instagram are not necessarily the type of high-quality training data that generative AI chatbots and search tools need to generate quality outputs.OpenAI, the company behind the AI chatbot ChatGPT, recently signed a multi-year deal with media giant News Corp, which owns outlets such as The Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch, and The Sun.Under the deal, reportedly worth $250 million over five years, OpenAI will be allowed to access the content from over a dozen news publishers to train its AI models .","Facebook-parent Meta is reportedly considering paying news organisations to better train its AI language models.

The AI PC era is here with Microsoft Copilot+ PCs with Windows 11. Alongside the new ARM-based PCs, Microsoft has announced a host of new AI-powered features that require at least 40 TOPs of AI performance to run.Here we’ve explained all the new AI-powered features that Microsoft has announced as a part of the entire Copilot+ PC with Windows 11.Windows 10 debuted with a feature called Timeline.The feature was aimed at keeping a record of everything that users have done on their PC in last couple of days. From accessing a file to websites, apps, software and whatnot. However, Microsoft nuked the feature only to bring it back as “Recall” with the power of AI that does everything Timeline used to do, but better and more efficiently.Recall is a powerful feature designed to help you find and revisit anything users have seen or done on their PC. It acts like a photographic memory, capturing and organising your digital activities so you can easily locate information without remembering exact file locations or details.Recall continuously records your screen, capturing snapshots of your activities across all applications, websites, documents, and more. It builds a personal semantic index based on your interactions, which is stored locally on your device to ensure privacy. You can interact with Recall using natural language, and it will search through your recorded data to find what you need.Cocreator allows users to combine ink strokes with text prompts to generate images in real-time. Leveraging Neural Processing Units (NPUs) and local language models, it iterates on the artwork, providing high-quality outputs with powerful diffusion-based algorithms. Users can adjust the creativity slider to range from literal to expressive styles and continue refining their artwork effortlessly.This new AI feature makes photo editing easier and simpler for users by allowing them to apply preset styles such as Cyberpunk or Claymation to their photos. Users can transform backgrounds, foregrounds, or entire images and get visual inspiration for their creative projects. On Copilot+ PCs, users can generate, fine-tune, and save endless images quickly.Microsoft has announced DaVinci Resolve Studio now features NPU-accelerated Magic Mask for applying visual effects, while CapCut uses Auto Cutout for instant video background removal. These enhancements streamline video editing and content creation processes.Cephable introduces faster adaptive input controls using head movements or facial expressions, thanks to NPU-powered camera pipelines. LiquidText provides smarter on-device AI annotations, ensuring data privacy by keeping processing local.This feature translates any audio passing through a PC into English subtitles in real-time, supporting over 40 languages and working offline. It's available across all Copilot+ PCs, ensuring accessibility and understanding in global communications.Microsoft has announced new and improved features including Portrait Light for better illumination, creative filters like illustrated and watercolour, Eye Contact Teleprompter, and enhancements to voice focus and portrait blur, all aimed at improving video call quality.Every Copilot+ PC includes Copilot, an advanced AI agent that offers natural voice conversations using the latest AI models, including GPT-4o. This personal AI assistant is designed for ease of use, with a dedicated Copilot key on keyboards for quick access.","Recall is a powerful feature designed to help you find and revisit anything users have seen or done on their PC.

Apple may bring iPhone 16 series in two new colours: Details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/apple-may-bring-iphone-16-series-in-two-new-colours-details/articleshow/110260524.cms,"

Pro models may get a new Rose colour

Apple

may rename existing colours

Apple iPhone 16 series launch is months away. But the rumour mill is buzzing with expected features, design and now colour of the 2024 iPhone lineup. Popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that the Cupertino-based company may add two new colours to the iPhone 16, replacing the existing ones.The information was shared by Kuo in a post on X, formerly Twitter .In the post, Kuo says that the Pro models - iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max could be offered in black, white or silver, gray or ""Natural Titanium,"" and an all-new rose. The existing iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are offered in Black Titanium, White Titanium, Blue Titanium and Natural Titanium colours.Kuo reveals that the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are expected to come in black, green, pink, blue and white colour variants. Apple may also rename previous colours as well, Kuo adds. For example, the existing white could be renamed to starlight. “Also, even if the colour name is the same as the existing model, it may look different”, he says.Earlier, Kuo said that the iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to feature a new battery with better energy density, potentially enhancing battery life if Apple maintains the same battery size. According to Kuo, iPhone 16 Pro Max will reportedly see a substantial redesign of its battery, switching from an aluminium to a stainless steel casing. This shift not only increases the battery's energy density but also improves its structural integrity. While stainless steel is less effective at dissipating heat compared to aluminium, it offers stronger protection, which could be beneficial for the overall durability of the device.In a related news, display analyst Ross Young said that the display production for Apple iPhone 16 will begin next month. This is on schedule with the timing of last year’s iPhone 15 production and the 2024 iPhone series launch may follow the same timeline as last year.","Apple may add two new colours to the iPhone 16, replacing the existing ones.

Phone condition: Assess the physical condition of the phone. Look for scratches, dents, or other signs of wear. Check the screen for cracks and ensure all buttons and ports function correctly.

Battery health: Battery life is crucial for a smooth user experience. Inquire about the battery health and ask for details on its capacity and degradation over time.

Software updates: Ensure the phone is compatible with the latest software updates from the manufacturer. Older devices may not receive updates, which can impact security and functionality.

Network compatibility: Confirm that the mobile phone is unlocked or compatible with your network carrier. Some phones are locked to specific carriers, limiting your options.

IMEI check: Verify the phone's IMEI number to ensure it's not stolen or blacklisted. This step helps prevent buying a phone with legal issues or unpaid bills.

Performance testing: Test the phone's performance by running apps, browsing the internet, and checking the camera quality. Look for lagging or freezing issues.

Storage capacity: Determine the phone's storage capacity and assess whether it meets your needs for storing photos, videos, and apps.

Price comparison: Research the market value of the phone model you're interested in. Compare prices from different sellers to ensure you're getting a fair deal.

In a bold move at the Cannes Film Festival, Polish director Patryk Vega unveiled his latest project, a biopic titled ""Putin,"" featuring an AI-generated deepfake of Russian President Vladimir Putin . The film, which has already been sold in 50 countries ahead of its September premiere, uses advanced artificial intelligence to replicate Putin's face on a real actor’s body.Vega, known for his popular Polish films, decided to use AI technology to create a more authentic portrayal of Putin.""To come extremely close to the dictator, we needed Putin, not an actor with make-up,"" Vega explained. The film’s trailer opens with a striking scene of the Russian leader cowering on the floor in diapers, setting the tone for its controversial narrative.As per an ET report, Vega humorously recounted his approach: ""I called Putin and asked him if he wanted to play in my movie... No, that was a joke."" Despite the jest, the director utilised AI to generate Putin's face due to the lack of sufficient high-resolution images for a full-body deepfake. The results, according to early viewers, are uncannily realistic.""Putin"" chronicles the life of the Russian president over six decades, starting from his childhood at age 10, where he is depicted being beaten by his stepfather. The film culminates in a fictional portrayal of his death, which Vega describes as ""a happy end.""The concept for the biopic emerged during the early days of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Initially, Vega aimed to make a film about the Russian mafia but shifted focus to what he considered ""the biggest gangster.""Despite potential risks, Vega dismisses fears of reprisals, boldly stating, ""Putin should be afraid of me."" The director's venture into AI has broader implications for the film industry, particularly in Hollywood, where the technology is both a boon and a source of concern. AI advancements threaten traditional roles, especially among special effects technicians and extras, raising fears of job losses.These concerns were central to last year's strike by actors and writers, culminating in an agreement that included compensation for the use of AI-generated likenesses. Despite apprehensions, AI is already extensively used in the industry. For example, it was employed to de-age Harrison Ford in the latest ""Indiana Jones"" film, though studios often refrain from publicising these uses.Beyond film production, AI's applications are expanding in various sectors of the media. The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, for instance, uses algorithms to analyse screenplays for gender and diversity biases. YouTube, a significant player in film promotion and distribution, has leveraged AI for over a decade, employing it for automated subtitles and copyright protections.Since April, YouTube has begun labelling AI-generated content and enhancing its detection programs. Justine Ryst, head of YouTube France, emphasised that ""AI isn't going to take over creation. It's going to simplify the complex, and make possible the impossible."" She advocated for a balance between innovation and responsibility in utilising AI.","Polish director Patryk Vega unveiled his latest project, a biopic titled ""Putin,"" featuring an AI-generated deepfake of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs. While staying comfortable during hot weather is essential, it doesn't have to come at the cost of soaring electricity bills. By implementing strategic energy-saving practices, you can reduce your summer electricity expenses without sacrificing comfort.Here you can explore several effective ways to save on summer electricity bills, offering practical tips and strategies that can help you minimise energy consumption and lower your utility costs during the warmer months. From optimising your cooling system to adopting energy-efficient habits, these recommendations are designed to make a noticeable impact on your electricity expenses while keeping your home cool and comfortable.Let's delve into these actionable tips that can help you save money and energy throughout the summer season.The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) issues BEE Star Labels as a voluntary method for manufacturers to indicate an appliance's energy efficiency. The label uses stars to indicate the efficiency of a product, with more stars indicating higher efficiency. Simply put, the higher the energy efficiency rating of the appliance, the lower its energy consumption. To effectively reduce your home's energy costs, opt for appliances with a 5-star BEE rating. Not only does this positively impact the environment, but it also helps lower your electricity bills. Explore Crompton's wide range of 5-star rated ceiling fans to learn more about BEE Rating Appliances.If your home still uses CFLs and incandescent bulbs, it's time to replace them with LED bulbs. LED bulbs are not just a trendy choice; they are recognized for their energy efficiency and superior illumination. If you're wondering how to reduce your electricity bill at home, switching to LED bulbs is the solution for you.Upgrading to smart appliances is a highly effective method to decrease electricity consumption at home.

Smart appliances typically come equipped with remote control capabilities, allowing you to schedule operations and conserve power. Crompton offers remote-controlled fans designed for enhanced energy savings and lower power consumption.These energy-efficient fans are gaining popularity due to their brushless direct current motors (BLDC), which operate on direct current electricity. They can help save up to 60% on electricity compared to normal induction motor-based fans. Additionally, they offer convenient features like remote control for turning the fan on and off, timer functionality, and compatibility with voice assistants. To learn more about the differences between BLDC fans and normal fans and how they can help reduce electricity bills, explore further information on BLDC fans versus conventional fans.Implementing a full solar power system for your home can be a substantial investment. However, there are more accessible and cost-effective ways to leverage solar energy. Installing outdoor solar lights in your balcony and garden, along with solar fans, can notably reduce your energy expenses at a modest cost. Additionally, using solar pumps for daily tasks can contribute to electricity savings. It's beneficial to understand the distinction between an electric geyser and a solar geyser to make an informed choice for your energy needs.Maintain your air conditioner at 24 degrees Celsius to optimise cooling and conserve energy during the summer months, effectively lowering electricity costs. Additionally, using a timer to automate AC operation and upgrading to a 5-star BEE-rated model can further enhance energy efficiency and reduce expenses associated with cooling your space.Numerous advanced smart energy metres are currently offered in the market.

Additionally, they can detect power leaks and identify high-energy-consuming appliances. Wi-Fi LED bulbs represent an excellent choice for reducing electricity usage.Regularly servicing and maintaining your home appliances is essential for optimal functionality and efficiency. Appliances that are not properly maintained are known to consume excessive energy, so routine maintenance can prolong their lifespan and reduce energy consumption. Learn more about the importance of cleaning exhaust fans.Install a power strip if you have several electronic devices or appliances that need to be plugged into a single electrical outlet. This allows you to easily turn off all devices at once when they are not in use, preventing unnecessary energy consumption often referred to as ""phantom"" energy loss.One of the simplest and most effective methods to lower electricity costs is by turning off electrical devices such as lights, fans, and air conditioners when they are not in use.","During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs.
