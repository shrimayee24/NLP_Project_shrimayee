New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme . This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy . Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

Apple Intelligence launch in China may face these three ‘challenges’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-intelligence-launch-in-china-may-face-these-three-challenges/articleshow/111147927.cms,"Tough rules for AI models

Ban on ChatGPT, which will be integrated in Apple devices

Privacy, a core focus for Apple

China has tough rules for AI models

Ban on OpenAI’s ChatGPT in China

Private Cloud Compute

Apple has announced Apple Intelligence , a suite of AI features that will run on iPhones, iPads and Mac PCs. The AI features will be available later this year to users globally, including China – one the most critical markets for the company. However, the company’s big AI push may face some challenges in China as regulators have in place strict rules around the technology amid tough competition.The three challenges that the company may face in China are (via CNBC):China’s AI market is tightly regulated and all companies launching AI models must have approval from the regulators for the commercial use of LLMs. The country has also made it mandatory for Generative AI providers to take down “illegal” content.Since some of the features of Apple Intelligence are developed by the company itself, Apple will likely need to get its AI model approved by authorities under Chinese rules.China has also banned OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Some of Apple’s voice assistant Siri’s capabilities are dependent on ChatGPT. This could mean that Apple may have to find a local AI company that provides the same level of capabilities as ChatGPT. Baidu and Alibaba are among China’s technology giants that have their own LLMs and voice assistants.Apple's AI launch highlighted a focus on user privacy. Their new system, Private Cloud Compute, processes user data on Apple-owned servers, with the company claiming the data itself is not stored.However, in China, Apple's iCloud data is stored on servers located locally and operated by a third party. This may raise concerns about whether Apple can maintain complete control over its AI computing servers in the country.This means that Apple must have a similar partnership for its AI servers in the region to keep user data private.","Apple has announced Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that will run on iPhones, iPads and Mac PCs.

It is “exceptional at writing high-quality content with a natural, relatable tone,” the company added.Additionally, Claude 3.5 Sonnet is also claimed to operate at twice the speed of its predecessor, making it suitable for complex tasks. Anthropic says that Internal testing showed Sonnet's superior ability to solve coding problems compared to Opus.With Vision support talk of the town, Sonnet is claimed to surpass previous models in visual tasks, particularly interpreting charts and graphs. It can also transcribe text from imperfect images, valuable for industries relying on visual information.As per the company, Claude.ai is also being introduced on Artifacts.“Today, we’re also introducing Artifacts on Claude.ai, a new feature that expands how users can interact with Claude.

"SIM swap scam: What is it, causes, signs, and tips for prevention",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/sim-swap-scam-what-is-it-causes-signs-and-tips-for-prevention/articleshow/111082258.cms,"SIM swap scams causes

Social engineering: Scammers use various techniques to deceive victims and mobile carrier employees into believing they are the legitimate owner of the phone number. This can involve phishing emails, calls, or text messages to collect personal information.

Data breaches: Large-scale data breaches can provide scammers with the necessary information to impersonate victims. This data can include names, addresses, social security numbers, and phone numbers.

Insider threats: In some cases, scammers may bribe or coerce employees within mobile carrier companies to facilitate the SIM swap.

Weak security practices: Mobile carriers sometimes have insufficient security protocols for verifying identity before transferring a number to a new SIM, making it easier for scammers to execute their schemes.

Signs you might be a victim of a SIM swap scam

Sudden loss of service: If your phone suddenly loses service and displays ""No Service"" or ""Emergency Calls Only,"" it could be a sign that your number has been transferred to another SIM.

Inability to make calls or send texts: If you can no longer make calls or send texts, it might indicate that your SIM card has been deactivated.

Unusual account activity: You might receive notifications of unusual login attempts or password changes from your email, bank, or social media accounts.

Receiving messages about SIM card changes: If you receive notifications from your mobile carrier about SIM card changes that you did not initiate, this is a red flag.

Access denied to accounts: If you are suddenly unable to access your bank accounts, email, or social media accounts despite entering the correct passwords, it could be a result of a SIM swap.

How to protect yourself from SIM swap scams

Enhance account security: Use strong, unique passwords for all online accounts and change them regularly. Avoid using easily guessable information such as birthdays or common words.

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Use 2FA methods that do not rely on SMS-based codes. Consider using authenticator apps or hardware tokens instead.

Be wary of phishing attempts: Do not click on links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious emails and messages. Verify the sender's identity before responding.

Monitor your accounts: Regularly check your bank, email, and social media accounts for any suspicious activity. Set up alerts to notify you of any unauthorised transactions or changes.

Contact your mobile carrier: Ask your mobile carrier to add a PIN or password to your account for an extra layer of security. Some carriers also offer the option to disable remote SIM swapping entirely.

Use identity protection services: Consider using identity theft protection services that monitor your personal information and alert you to potential fraud.

Report suspicious activity: If you suspect you are a victim of a SIM swap scam, contact your mobile carrier immediately to restore your service and secure your accounts. Additionally, report the incident to your bank and other relevant institutions.

Google rolls out Pixel Camera 9.4 update with Pro lens selection and improved HDR+,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/google-rolls-out-pixel-camera-9-4-update-with-pro-lens-selection-and-improved-hdr/articleshow/111060782.cms,"Google has begun releasing a significant update to its Pixel Camera app, bringing new features and enhancements to several Pixel smartphone models . Version 9.4 of the app, which is currently rolling out via the Google Play Store, adds a Pro Lens selection mode and improves the HDR+ functionality on supported Pixel phones like the Pixel 6 Pro, Pixel 7 Pro, Pixel 8 Pro and Pixel Fold.One of the key additions in Pixel Camera 9.4 is the new Pro Lens selection feature. This allows users to manually choose between the ultra-wide, wide, and telephoto lenses on their device when taking a photo, rather than relying on the camera app to automatically select the appropriate lens. The Pro Lens option can be found under a new ""Pro"" tab in the camera settings.The update also brings improvements to HDR+ ( High Dynamic Range Plus ), Google's computational photography technology that combines multiple exposures to create images with better detail and dynamic range. Pixel Camera 9.4 enhances HDR+ with smarter automatic frame selection, favouring shots where subjects have their eyes open and are smiling.Additionally, the placement of the RAW/JPEG toggle has been moved from an obscure location in the settings to the more easily accessible Pro tab. However, unlike the Pixel 8 Pro, there is no option to adjust the image resolution.While the new version of Pixel Camera is currently available for download, users may not see the new features immediately after installing the update. The additional functionality is expected to be enabled via a server-side update from Google or with the release of the June Pixel Feature Drop .","Google has begun rolling out version 9.4 of its Pixel Camera app. It adds a Pro Lens selection mode and improves the HDR+ functionality on supported Pixel phones.
