Livvy Dunne ’s frightening stalker experience sparks public concern







In a heartbreaking TikTok video, LSU gymnast Olivia “Livvy” Dunne opened up about a terrifying reality that she’s been silently battling—being relentlessly followed and harassed by groups of organized autograph seekers during her travels. Known for her vibrant social media presence and positive interactions with fans, Livvy has made it clear this isn’t about genuine supporters. What she’s referring to is a disturbing pattern of unwanted confrontations with “middle-aged men with stacks of pictures” who aggressively chase her down in airports across the country.The viral video captured Dunne’s emotional vulnerability, as she admitted, “I fear that I’m being stalked and I don’t know what to do.” With more than eight million followers, the Sports Illustrated cover star said these men don’t just show up at major hubs—they somehow track her even through brief stopovers in remote cities like Omaha, Nebraska. “It’s gotten to the point that every single time I go to the airport, there’s a group… and they harass me… They will run after me down the TSA pre-check line and yell at me if I don’t give them my autograph. ”Livvy recounted a particularly horrifying experience where she was circled at baggage claim, adding, “They know time, place, airport, everything!!!” What makes the situation even more unsettling is that these individuals seem to have access to detailed travel information, raising serious concerns about privacy and airline data security.The issue is clearly not isolated. Livvy cited Olympic sprinter Gabby Thomas, who shared similar experiences and also urged change. “It needs to stop because it’s scary for girls. It’s weird,” Livvy said. Gabby backed her up, commenting, “Girl!! So sad that because we’re good at what we do people feel like they should have constant access to us and give us travel anxiety.”The problem goes beyond public nuisance—it’s a safety crisis that female athletes and public figures are increasingly facing. Dunne, who was already forced to take online classes at LSU for safety reasons following an incident in 2023, ended her message with a heartfelt plea: “It’s just so strange. Stay safe!”Livvy’s courage in speaking out puts a spotlight on the darker side of fame. It’s a call for better security, stronger policies, and above all, respect for the personal boundaries of those in the public eye.Also Read: What is Tommy John surgery and why does Dodgers reliever Evan Phillips need it now?",LSU gymnast Olivia “Livvy” Dunne opened up about a terrifying reality that she’s been silently battling.

Amid the fallout from his viral yacht party video, New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs has stirred even more speculation by posting a cryptic two-word message. The brief phrase, shared on his Instagram Story, has been widely interpreted as a flirtatious nod to rapper Cardi B , who is rumored to be romantically linked with the NFL star.The timing of Stefon Diggs’ post is no coincidence. Just days earlier, footage emerged from a lavish Memorial Day yacht party showing Diggs surrounded by women and handing out a mysterious pink powder.Cardi B, known for her unfiltered commentary on social media, has remained silent throughout the controversy, sparking even more curiosity about the nature of her relationship with Diggs and how she views the incident. The two-word phrase “baby brim” has only added fuel to the rumors, with fans wondering whether it’s a pet name, a private reference, or a subtle message meant specifically for the rapper.Diggs followed up his “baby brim” post with another cryptic message. “To the month of May, I appreciate you none the less… gotta stay focused 🤞🏾.” The line suggests he’s reflecting on recent events while trying to shift focus toward the future.Meanwhile, NFL insider Albert Breer has hinted that the Patriots may consider parting ways with Diggs to avoid the $25 million guaranteed in his contract.

Steelers face growing uncertainty as Aaron Rodgers refuses to confirm potential move to Pittsburgh



Aaron Rodgers is ""absolutely"" worth the wait for Steelers with the lack of a QB room | THE FACILITY





As the NFL offseason rolls on, the Pittsburgh Steelers find themselves entangled in a cloud of uncertainty—waiting on a man who has mastered the art of keeping teams, fans, and analysts guessing: Aaron Rodgers. For weeks now, quiet optimism has surrounded the Steelers' facility as whispers of a Rodgers arrival have grown louder. Yet, with Organized Team Activities underway and mandatory minicamp looming from June 10 to 12, the team still hasn’t received a definitive answer from the future Hall of Famer.""I have been told that he has not affirmatively told the Steelers that he's coming,"" NFL insider Tom Pelissero revealed on The Rich Eisen Show. ""There's all these signs that he's coming, but he's not affirmatively said, 'Hey, June 9, book me the ticket, I'm coming in and I'm gonna join this team.' That has not happened as of this point.""While Rodgers remains silent, the Steelers continue to act as if a deal might materialize. Hints have been dropped, foundations quietly laid, and belief sustained within the organization that the four-time MVP might indeed be Pittsburgh-bound.But Pelissero made it clear—no formal commitment has been made.In the meantime, Mason Rudolph is making his case as the placeholder-turned-potential starter. The veteran quarterback, familiar with Pittsburgh’s system and locker room, has stepped up during OTAs. His calm command and playoff experience from seasons past offer at least a temporary solution should Rodgers opt out of returning to football—or choose a different path altogether.The biggest complication? Time. Rodgers has left his intentions hanging in the balance. Despite a past visit to Pittsburgh’s facility and hints dropped during various podcast appearances, including a cryptic response about rival teams, the legendary quarterback continues to leave the Steelers hanging.ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler recently echoed the ongoing standstill:""When I talk to people with the team, they say the same thing—that they have had contact with Aaron Rodgers. They've remained optimistic that he will be a Steeler, but there is just nothing fast and firm yet on him signing with the team.""Rodgers’ media trail has only added to the confusion. He spoke about retirement as a possibility during an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show, hinted at personal issues behind the scenes, and avoided football altogether during his chat on The Joe Rogan Experience. More recently, his comments on the “You Know What I Mean” podcast reignited speculation, as he dismissed the idea of playing for the Chicago Bears but teased interest in a team that travels to Chicago this season—fueling theories, but offering no clarity.For now, the Steelers are operating with their backup plan while watching the market thin out. Justin Fields and Russell Wilson are gone. Kirk Cousins is unlikely, with the Falcons’ asking price reportedly too high. That leaves Rodgers as their only realistic marquee option.And yet, he hasn’t shown his hand.Steelers fans, executives, and players are caught in a waiting game—with a quarterback known for playing them well. Whether Rodgers finally commits to Pittsburgh or walks away from the game altogether, remains one of the biggest offseason questions in the NFL.Until then, the Steelers wait. And only Aaron Rodgers knows how long that wait will last.Also Read: Why Kansas City Chiefs veterans are the real reason behind the team's consistent dominance","Pittsburgh Steelers remain in the dark as Aaron Rodgers avoids affirming any signing news.

Understanding AC condensate water

What is AC condensate water?

Is condensate water pure?

Dust and dirt on the coils

Algae or mold in the drainage system

Metal traces from corroded components (aluminum, copper)

Air pollutants like volatile organic compounds (VOCs)

Why do inverter batteries need distilled water?

Free from minerals and impurities

Non-conductive, preventing short circuits

Neutral in pH, avoiding chemical imbalance in the battery

Can you use AC condensate water in inverter batteries

Theoretical possibility vs. practical risk

It has no added salts

It originates from atmospheric water vapor

It’s free and readily available

Risks of using AC condensate water in batteries

1. Presence of heavy metals and ions

Zinc, copper, and aluminum particles from AC coils

Traces of refrigerants in older or leaking systems

Corrosion by-products from drainage lines

Plate corrosion

Sediment formation

Shortened battery life

2. Microbial contamination

Cooling tower make-up water

Filtered through a multi-stage system

Tested with a TDS meter (Target: <10 ppm)

Boiled and condensed again to mimic distilled water

Validated for pH and conductivity

With rising temperatures and increasing dependence on air conditioners, many households and businesses are noticing a side effect of cooling—the consistent dripping of water from AC discharge pipes. This water, known as condensate water, is the byproduct of the air conditioning process where moisture from humid air condenses on the evaporator coils and is expelled through a drain pipe. Given its clean appearance, many people wonder: can this water be reused—particularly for inverter batteries that require distilled water for maintenance?In a time of growing water scarcity and rising electricity needs, especially in tropical regions, reusing resources like condensate water seems like an eco-conscious choice. However, using AC condensate water in inverter batteries is not a straightforward decision. There are technical, chemical, and practical factors to consider.Air conditioners cool air by passing it over cold evaporator coils. As warm, moist air hits these coils, moisture condenses into water—much like how water forms on a cold glass on a humid day. This condensed moisture then collects in a tray and is discharged through a drain line.While condensate water originates from atmospheric moisture, it is not guaranteed to be chemically pure. Factors affecting its purity include:Therefore, although it may appear clear, AC discharge water can contain impurities, including bacteria and metal ions.Most lead-acid inverter batteries rely on electrolyte levels (a mix of sulfuric acid and water) to function correctly. Over time, water in the electrolyte evaporates, and users need to refill it periodically.Distilled water is used because it is:Using anything other than distilled water can damage the battery plates, reduce its lifespan, and even cause dangerous chemical reactions.At first glance, AC condensate water may seem like a good substitute for distilled water because:However, scientific and engineering experts warn against its direct use for several reasons.Even though it comes from air, condensate water can absorb:These contaminants can interfere with the chemical reaction inside a battery, leading to:Stagnant water in drain pipes can breed algae, bacteria, and mold, which may introduce biological contaminants into the battery.This can:Condensate water may have a slightly acidic or alkaline pH, depending on environmental factors. This imbalance can disrupt the electrochemical stability of the battery electrolyte.Distilled water sold for battery use is subject to stringent quality controls. AC discharge water, however, is not regulated, tested, or certified for battery use.If you’re interested in using AC water for other purposes, here are recommended safe uses:If you’re adamant about using it for batteries, it must be:Even then, results are not guaranteed, and risk remains high without lab-grade testing.","Air conditioners cool air by passing it over cold evaporator coils.

Explanation of each group

If you’re ready to kick off your Saturday with a brain-boosting puzzle, look no further than today’s edition of Connections, the New York Times ’ increasingly popular daily game. Whether you’re a casual word lover or a full-on puzzle enthusiast, this challenge is a great way to test your pattern recognition and vocabulary skills. Below, you’ll find a full guide including hints, today’s answers, and category explanations. Proceed with caution—spoilers lie ahead, but if you want help solving without giving everything away, the hints might just point you in the right direction.Connections is a daily word association game from the New York Times. Out of 16 given words, the objective is to group them into four sets of four connected by a common theme. These themes may be concrete (like “types of fruit”) or abstract (like “things you blow”), and they increase in difficulty, moving from yellow (easiest) to purple (hardest). Each grouping has only one correct combination, so careful thought is required.You start with a grid of 16 words. Your task is to figure out how they can be divided into four distinct groups of four, with each group sharing a common trait. Select four words you think are connected and submit them. If correct, they’ll be grouped and removed from the board. If not, the game will give you feedback, possibly saying you’re “one away.” But beware—you only get four mistakes before the game ends. You can play Connections free online at the NYT Games site.Here are subtle clues to help you think about today’s word groupings:Yellow group – Alcove: cavity, hollow, nook, recessGreen group – Ways to recognize achievement: certificate, medal, plaque, trophyBlue group – Verbs in breadmaking: ferment, proof, rest, risePurple group – Things you can blow: bubble, fuse, kiss, raspberryAlcove: These words—cavity, hollow, nook, recess—are all synonyms or closely related to small hidden spaces or indentations. Despite the dental misdirection from cavity and plaque, only one made the cut here.Ways to recognize achievement: This set includes certificate, medal, plaque, and trophy, all common tokens of recognition in academics, sports, and other achievements. It’s a straightforward category once you discard the dental association of plaque.Verbs in breadmaking: Perhaps the trickiest of the four, this group—ferment, proof, rest, rise—includes steps in preparing bread dough. These words might confuse players unfamiliar with baking terminology.Things you can blow: Bubble, fuse, kiss, and raspberry all fit this playful and diverse category. From the literal (blowing bubbles) to the idiomatic (blowing a fuse), it’s a fun mix.Saturday’s Connections was a clever puzzle with a nice mix of wordplay and thematic trickery. The dental red herring and baking jargon offered some challenges, but the groups fell into place with a bit of lateral thinking. Whether you got them all or needed a nudge, remember it’s all about learning and having fun.

LinkedIn lays off hundreds of employees across California: Engineers and others affected



iPhone 16e: 5 Reasons to buy the most affordable iPhone 16 series model!

LinkedIn is laying off 281 employees across California, impacting engineers and other units, a report claims. The Microsoft-owned professional networking platform has notified affected workers earlier, a WARN document filed with local officials claims. The job cuts are reportedly distributed across several locations: 159 positions in Mountain View, 60 in San Francisco, 23 in Sunnyvale, 11 in Carpinteria, and 28 remote workers based in California. These layoffs seem to be a part of a larger wave of job reductions at parent company Microsoft. Earlier this month, it was reported that 122 Bay Area Microsoft employees were laid off as part of an estimated 6,000-employee cut across the tech giant. In April, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also stated that artificial intelligence (AI) was responsible for writing up to 30% of the company's code, which may be the reason behind these job cuts.According to the WARN filing (seen by SF Gate), LinkedIn has laid off a significant number of software engineers. In Mountain View alone, 71 positions across three broad categories of software engineers, including those with “staff” and “senior” in their titles, are being eliminated.This count doesn’t include additional specialists in areas like machine learning, DevOps, and systems infrastructure, some of whom are also affected, the report notes. The filing further lists roles such as deal desk strategists, product managers, designers, and various other professionals among those impacted.However, the report didn’t reveal details about the full extent of the layoffs announced by the company, which is headquartered on the border of Sunnyvale and Mountain View with several other offices worldwide.LinkedIn and its parent company, Microsoft, have yet to respond to inquiries regarding the reasons behind the job cuts, details about severance packages, or whether more layoffs are anticipated.In 2023, when the company laid off 716 employees, LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky addressed the decision in a publicly shared email. So far, no such communication has been released this time. Meanwhile, LinkedIn’s “About Us” page states that the company employs both 18,400 people and more than 18,500 full-time employees.","LinkedIn is laying off 281 employees across California, a report claims.

Government seeks unprecedented AI restrictions

Market shifts signal competitive pressure



A federal judge sharply challenged Google 's arguments against proposed antitrust remedies during closing arguments Friday, questioning the tech giant's stance on restrictions that could limit its artificial intelligence ambitions and search dominance.U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta pushed back against Google lawyer John Schmidtlein's claims that the Justice Department hadn't proven sufficient causation for drastic remedies. ""They are telling you that you don't need any causal connection to do any of these remedies,"" Schmidtlein argued. ""That is wrong."" The judge's pointed questioning suggested skepticism toward Google's defense strategy.The Justice Department has proposed sweeping remedies including forcing Google to sell its Chrome browser, ending its $20 billion annual payments to Apple for default search placement, and crucially, restricting Google's ability to promote its Gemini AI product . ""The reason we are so focused on Gen AI is because that is the new search access point,"" Justice Department lawyer David Dahlquist explained, positioning AI as the future battleground for search dominance.The government's case centers on preventing Google from monopolizing next-generation search through AI, pointing to testimony that Google now pays Samsung and Motorola to pre-install Gemini on devices. This mirrors the exclusive deals that helped maintain Google's roughly 90% search market share.The urgency surrounding AI became apparent when Apple executives testified that Google searches in Safari had declined for the first time in two decades, while Apple plans to offer AI options like ChatGPT within the next year. Alphabet shares fell sharply following this revelation, though Google disputed the claims.Judge Mehta questioned whether AI companies that don't build traditional search engines should access Google's valuable data under proposed remedies. He also floated making payment bans contingent on other remedies failing and asked whether forcing Chrome's sale might be ""cleaner and more elegant"" than alternatives.The judge expects to rule in August, with Google planning to appeal regardless of the outcome.",Judge Amit Mehta questioned Google's arguments against proposed remedies.

The 25-year quest to find Miss Atomic Bomb ends.

A city built on 'nuclear tourism'

The start of the quest

Who was Anna Lee Mahoney?

More than just a photograph





For 25 years, one question consumed retired scientist Robert Friedrichs: Who was the woman behind the most famous photograph in Las Vegas’ history?The mysterious showgirl captured in a 1957 promotional photograph became an enduring symbol of atomic-age America. Posed in a mushroom cloud-shaped swimsuit with arms outstretched against the Nevada desert, she was known only by her stage name ""Lee A. Merlin”.The iconic photograph emerged from a unique moment in American history when the display of nuclear power captured public attention between 1951 and 1992.Las Vegas sought to capitalise on the trend, and sent in a photographer in 1957 to shoot a promotional ad for ‘nuclear tourism’. Nuclear tourism refers to travel focused on atomic history, where visitors explore nuclear test sites, reactors, and related museums to experience and learn about the Atomic age.The photographer shot the model in a fluffy, mushroom-shaped swimsuit, immitating a nuclear cloud, in high-heels and a smiling face, strectching her arms as the desert unfolded behind her.It became one of the most requested photographs, shaping Las Vegas' identity as a city of fantasy and spectacle.Yet little was known about the model in th photo.Friedrichs in 2000 started his quest for the lady when the Atomic Museum was preparing to open in Las Vegas. As a founding member, he hoped to locate Miss Atomic Bomb for the grand opening ceremony. What started as simple curiosity evolved into an all-consuming obsession.His investigation filled stacks of binders with clues and potential leads. He tracked down the original photographer, Don English, and interviewed former showgirls who confirmed the stage name ""Lee A. Merlin."" But the woman's true identity remained elusive, with leads drying up and months turning into years.The breakthrough came unexpectedly last winter. After Friedrichs delivered a presentation about his search at the Atomic Museum, an audience member sent him an obituary the following day. One detail jumped out: the deceased woman had once been the lead dancer at the Sands Hotel.Her name was Anna Lee Mahoney.Born on August 14, 1927, in the Bronx, Mahoney was trained in ballet in New York before transitioning to stage performances under her professional name, ‘Lee A. Merlin’. By 1957, she had become the lead dancer at the famous Sands Hotel in Las Vegas.After retiring from dance, Mahoney reinvented herself as a mental health counselor, working in the field for 30 years. She later moved to Hawaii, married, and lived quietly until her death from cancer in 2001 in Santa Cruz, California.The Miss Atomic Bomb photograph transcended its original promotional purpose to become a touchstone.For Friedrichs, solving the mystery represented more than satisfying personal curiosity. ""The missing name was a gap in the historical record, and I wanted to fix it,"" he explained, comparing it to knowing someone was the first US president but forgetting their name.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

How Amazon and Microsoft are thriving in this space while Apple is not

How this may be a risk to Apple

While tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are advancing rapidly in the AI sector, Apple is reportedly at a disadvantage. Despite its efforts to push forward with AI initiatives, the iPhone maker lacks the essential infrastructure and long-term investment in core AI technologies that its competitors have spent years, if not decades, developing, a new report indicates.For example, Apple delayed its planned overhaul of Siri earlier this year because the upgrade, meant to usher Siri into the generative AI era, wasn’t ready. According to a report by Business Insider, if Apple wants to modernise Siri to its competitors' levels, it may need to build critical AI components from scratch—an expensive, time-consuming process that could take years. Otherwise, it may be forced to rely more heavily on competitors or acquire startups at scale to catch up.For having a successful AI product, one needs to have certain AI building blocks. Google already has nearly all the core AI building blocks in place, while Microsoft and Amazon have some of them. Google controls the deep stack of technologies powering its AI building blocks -- data, chips, data centres, cloud business and means to disseminate the products -- which is why it is able to launch AI consumer tools like Veo, Flow, Imagen and so on.In 2017, Google invented Transformer, the breakthrough architecture behind modern generative AI. Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Google's AI chips, have been around since 2016 and are now integral to both Google products and external developers using Google Cloud.Google also benefits from decades of web indexing and data collection. This immense dataset supports the training of its powerful AI models, datacenters and a cloud business to make these tools available to customers.Both Microsoft and Amazon have some of these building blocks, including AI models, cloud infrastructure, dedicated AI units working on the technology and even partnerships. Apple, on the other hand, lacks many of these assets and doesn't have this kind of access or infrastructure.Apple still doesn't operate enough large-scale data centres and relies on Google data centres for functions like iCloud backups. For recent AI training, Apple even requested access to Google’s TPUs—essentially borrowing infrastructure from a direct rival.Reportedly, Apple is also about 7 years behind Google in developing AI chips for data centers. When it comes to data, though Apple has access to huge volumes of data from its devices, it has been conservative in using that data for AI training due to its privacy-first policies. This restricts its ability to build and refine large-scale models.The report also said that Apple has also lagged in recruiting and retaining top AI talent.If generative AI ends up reshaping how people interact with computing devices, including smartphones and laptops, Apple’s delayed investment in AI infrastructure could become a critical problem. While other tech giants are rolling out robust, end-to-end AI systems, Apple is still piecing together the basic components.","Apple lacks the infrastructure and long-term investment in core AI technologies that its competitors have spent years, if not decades, developing.

Google says it will appeal court's decision in Search case: Read company's 6-point response to remedies proposed by justice department,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-says-it-will-appeal-courts-decision-in-search-case-read-companys-6-point-response-to-remedies-proposed-by-justice-department/articleshow/121539177.cms,"What remedies DOJ has demanded and what the judge said



The DOJ’s proposed remedies go miles beyond...: Google

Yesterday, we made closing arguments in the DOJ search remedies trial. The DOJ’s proposed remedies go miles beyond the Court’s decision & would harm consumers, businesses and America’s tech leadership. Here are a few key points from our arguments. ⬇️

1/ DOJ waved off very real privacy issues, saying they’d be resolved later on. In fact, one DOJ lawyer said “the only thing we can do is give [rivals] more data.” 🤔

2/ When confronted with significant questions left open by their proposals (i.e. how much data should Google be forced to share?), DOJ just said it could all be worked out by a “Technical Committee” of mostly govt-appointed experts.

3/ The DOJ’s proposal reserves the right for the government to decide who gets Google users’ data. Not the Court.

4/ The DOJ spent many hours trying to convince the Court to remake the tech sector. Meanwhile it’s very clear the AI space is highly competitive today: Countless rivals in the AI space are growing fast & gaining users & distribution without government intervention.

5/ While we heard a lot about how the remedies would help various well-funded competitors (w/ repeated references to Bing), we heard very little about how all this helps consumers.

6/ We will wait for the Court’s opinion. And we still strongly believe the Court’s original decision was wrong, and look forward to our eventual appeal.

Android smartphones that will lose WhatsApp support from June 1

Why WhatsApp will stop working on these devices

What users of smartphones on which WhatsApp will stop working can do



Starting this Sunday, June 1, 2025, WhatsApp, the Meta-owned messaging platform, will stop support for several older smartphone models as part of its routine update cycle. This change, initially scheduled for May 5, 2025, was delayed by a few weeks to allow users additional time to prepare. The update raises the app’s minimum system requirements, rendering it incompatible with certain legacy devices.WhatsApp will require iOS 15.1 or later for iPhones and Android 5.1 or higher for Android devices. As a result, the following iPhone models will no longer support WhatsApp:These models are limited to iOS versions below 15.1, making them incompatible with the updated app. However, some reports have mistakenly included the iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and iPhone SE (1st generation) in the affected list. These devices can run iOS 15.8.4, the latest supported version for them, and should remain compatible with WhatsApp until a future update raises requirements again, likely not for another one to two years.On the Android side, devices running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or earlier will also lose support. This includes older models like the Samsung Galaxy S3, HTC One X, and Sony Xperia Z, though specific Android model lists vary due to the platform’s fragmentation.WhatsApp periodically updates its minimum requirements to leverage newer operating system features, enhance security, and optimize performance. Older devices, often limited by hardware constraints, struggle to support modern app functionalities like end-to-end encryption, video calling, or new interface elements. By dropping support for outdated systems, WhatsApp ensures a consistent user experience across its approximately 3 billion global users.If you or someone you know uses an affected device, here are your options:* Upgrade the Device: Switching to a newer smartphone supporting iOS 15.1 or Android 5.1 (or later) will ensure continued access to WhatsApp. Budget-friendly options like the iPhone SE (2nd or 3rd generation) or mid-range Android devices are widely available.* Update iOS (if possible): For devices like the iPhone 6s, 6s Plus, or SE (1st gen), ensure the device is updated to iOS 15.8.4 via Settings > General > Software Update to maintain compatibility.* Switch to Alternatives: Other messaging apps like Telegram or Signal may still support older devices, though their user bases are smaller. Check their respective app stores for compatibility.* Backup Chats: Before losing access, back up WhatsApp conversations to iCloud (iPhone) or Google Drive (Android) to transfer them to a new device. Go to WhatsApp Settings > Chats > Chat Backup to secure your data.This change aligns with industry trends, as apps increasingly phase out support for older systems. Apple’s own data from 2024 indicates that only about 5% of active iPhones run iOS 15 or earlier, suggesting limited impact in developed markets. However, users in regions with slower device turnover may face challenges. WhatsApp has advised affected users to upgrade devices by June 1, 2025, to avoid service disruptions.For more details, visit WhatsApp’s official support page or check your device’s compatibility in the App Store or Google Play Store. If you’re unsure about your device’s status, you can verify its iOS version under Settings > General > About on iPhone or Settings > About Phone on Android.","WhatsApp will stop working on several older smartphone models on June 1, 2025.

It presents players with a 4x4 grid of 16 seemingly unrelated words. The goal is to organise them into four groups of four words that are connected by a common theme or idea. These themes can range from synonyms and item categories to clever wordplay and pop culture references. The game tests not just vocabulary, but lateral thinking as well.Playing Connections is simple but tricky. You start with a grid of 16 words. Your task is to group the words into four sets of four that share a common link. These links can be literal, metaphorical, or based on word associations. Once you select a group of four words, hit the 'Submit' button. If correct, that group is removed from the board. You only get four chances to make mistakes, so choose wisely.

Toilet paper, foil, ribbon, and tape are all stored and dispensed from rolls, making the connection logical and physical.The blue group includes popular promotional items. If you've attended any conference or corporate event, you’ve likely come home with a hat, tee, tote bag, or water bottle emblazoned with a company logo.The purple group is a fun wordplay category. Each word can be paired with “shack” to form a well-known term or brand: Caddyshack (film), Love Shack (song by The B-52’s), RadioShack (retail chain), and Shake Shack (restaurant chain).Today’s puzzle was a satisfying mix of straightforward connections and clever wordplay. The trickiest part was arguably the purple group, but once “Radio” and “Shake” were spotted, the pattern clicked into place.

A comeback rooted in authenticity and quiet strength

Post-baby glow with purpose and presence





Supermodel Gisele Bündchen is back in front of the camera, and her return is nothing short of breathtaking. Just three months after welcoming her third child — her first with boyfriend Joaquim Valente — the 44-year-old icon is redefining postpartum beauty and proving that motherhood can be just as radiant as any runway moment.For the June/July 2025 issue of Vogue France, Bündchen collaborated with legendary photographer Mario Sorrenti in a dreamy editorial that blends ethereal fashion with emotional resonance. Draped in sheer lace gowns reminiscent of both Victorian elegance and forest fairy-tale magic, Gisele channels serenity, power, and femininity in every frame. It's a stark contrast to the high-drama fashion editorials of old, offering a softer, soul-rich vision of beauty.These images, which she described as part of a broader wellness message, aren't just about style — they're about presence. “To me, wellness goes far beyond physical health. It’s not just about what you eat or how you move, it’s also about how you feel, think, and live,” Bündchen shared on Instagram. “It’s in your thoughts, your habits, the boundaries you honor, and the inner peace you protect. True wellness is about embracing, honoring, and nourishing every part of who you are.This isn’t just a return to modeling for Gisele — it’s a reintroduction of the woman she’s become. After years devoted to raising her children with ex-husband Tom Brady, as well as helping co-parent his eldest, Bündchen’s latest chapter is one of empowerment and earned peace.“I feel more comfortable in my own skin and have a clearer understanding of my priorities,” she told Vogue France. “I’m grateful for where I am. I feel like I’ve earned it.”Even the glamour of hair and makeup felt like a personal reward. “Having my hair and make-up done makes me feel like I’m on vacation,” she joked, revealing that in the early weeks with her newborn, she “hardly brushed [her] hair.”With her baby boy — whose middle name is reportedly River — now sleeping through the night, Gisele says she’s finally regaining her rhythm. On Mother’s Day, she shared a glimpse of her “little angel” and opened up about “embracing the slower rhythms” of life.Also Read: “It was tough”: Tom Brady admits parental failures after public humiliation and split from Gisele Bündchen Whether she's wading through coastal waters or redefining wellness, Gisele Bündchen’s return is a powerful reminder that beauty, strength, and self-love don’t fade — they evolve.",Gisele Bündchen is back in front of the camera for Vogue France.

Erin Andrews sees excitement in long-distance relationships

Charissa Thompson stands firm: “No more marriage for me”

Episode 330: Pregame - …With a Broken Heart | Calm Down Podcast





In the ever-evolving world of love and relationships, FOX’s NFL sideline reporter Erin Andrews is offering a refreshing take—especially when it comes to long-distance romance. Speaking candidly on her Calm Down podcast with co-host and close friend Charissa Thompson, Andrews offered heartfelt advice to fans navigating complicated love lives.Erin Andrews’ life may be a whirlwind of sportscasting, fashion ventures, and podcasting, but she’s never been shy about opening up. On a recent episode of Calm Down, a listener asked about handling long-distance relationships. Andrews didn't sugarcoat the challenges, but her message was rooted in optimism.“Look, I think it’s hard to date in the same city, in a different state. It’s also hard to find the right person,” she admitted. However, she encouraged listeners not to give up on love just because of logistics. “If you have a crush and they live in another state, I don’t think that should deter you from not moving forward,” Andrews said. She even called it “exciting” when you finally get to reunite with your partner after time apart.Andrews wrapped her advice with the kind of real-world wisdom that has made her podcast such a hit: “If you have the means, if you have the patience, if you are interested in each other that much, see where it goes.”While Erin Andrews leans into love, Charissa Thompson is waving goodbye to the idea of ever marrying again. With two previous marriages behind her, Thompson is content with where she is—no veil, no vows, just love.“I am never getting married again,” Thompson declared firmly on the podcast. “People just want to show up for the party... I’m just not going to have a wedding.”Her stance isn’t new. In another conversation with Kylie Kelce, she reflected on her past, saying, “I married the wrong people, plural. I don’t want to attach myself to something that I can’t detach from.”Even when fans questioned her love life on social media, Thompson kept it classy. Responding to a sarcastic question about how many times she plans to get married, she replied, “No more marriage for me, but thanks for asking. Just being with a man who is kind and doesn’t take from me is all the commitment I need!”Also Read: No more Reputation Taylor's Version—Taylor Swift backs away from ‘Reputation’ re-recording, fans accuse her of stalling Whether you’re chasing love across state lines or choosing to stay single and fulfilled, Erin Andrews and Charissa Thompson offer two powerful and valid views on modern relationships.
