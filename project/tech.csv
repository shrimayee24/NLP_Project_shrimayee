Kaitlyn Siragusa , better known as Amouranth, a viral internet personality and streamer who has made her highly anticipated return to Twitch on June 20, 2025. Over the past two years, she earned a staggering $38 million on rival streaming platform Kick , becoming one of the most financially successful figures in online entertainment. Known for her bold mix of gaming, cosplay , ASMR, and real-life streams, Amouranth originally built her empire on Twitch before facing multiple bans and moving to other platforms. Her return signals both a personal comeback and a potential shift in the ongoing competition between streaming giants.Her return to Twitch not only marks a personal comeback but also highlights the evolving dynamics of the streaming industry. With platforms like Kick scaling back exclusivity deals and encouraging multistreaming, Amouranth’s move could signal a new era where top creators leverage multiple platforms on their own terms. While her relationship with YouTube remains strained, Twitch’s massive audience and cultural influence make it the ideal stage for her to continue growing her brand.Amouranth began her career as a cosplayer and model before joining Twitch in 2016, where she quickly gained massive popularity. Her streams combined gaming, audience interaction, and ASMR, attracting millions of viewers. She became especially known for her “hot tub” streams, a controversial Twitch subgenre that sparked widespread discussion. Despite facing repeated bans for pushing Twitch’s content boundaries, Amouranth remained a fan favorite and expanded her influence through various business ventures, including OnlyFans and merchandise. Her ability to adapt and innovate helped her become one of Twitch’s most successful and recognizable creators.In 2023, following xQc’s headline-making $100 million deal with Kick, Amouranth joined the platform backed by crypto gambling site Stake. Though the details of her contract were not publicly disclosed, she confirmed that her income more than doubled compared to Twitch.

Given this history, she is not expected to include YouTube in her future content plans.Even during her Kick run, Amouranth remained a widely recognized figure. She launched products, signed brand deals, and continued to grow her online presence. Her return to Twitch highlights her ongoing relevance and reflects the increasing competition among platforms to attract big names.

Camera upgrades: This model boasts a 48-megapixel primary camera sensor, offering significant improvements in daylight, low-light, and portrait photography compared to its predecessor.

Battery life: Apple claims the iPhone 15 has ""all-day battery life,"" though real-world usage suggests it can last over 9 hours with average usage.

Processor: Powered by Apple's A16 Bionic chip, an upgrade from the A15 chip used in the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, with Pro models receiving the faster A16 chip.

Charging port: Notably, the iPhone 15 features a USB Type-C charging port, replacing the Lightning port used in previous models and aligning with the more commonly used USB Type-C standard.

How Indian-origin Zohran Mamdani used the Trump playbook to beat Andrew Cuomo - and become Democratic Mayoral Nominee,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-indian-origin-zohran-mamdani-used-the-trump-playbook-to-beat-andrew-cuomo-and-become-democratic-mayoral-nominee/articleshow/122060091.cms,"The Trump of TikTok—Minus the Tan



Trump 2016



Who Is Zohran Mamdani?



Cuomo Brought a Knife to a Meme Fight



What Happens Now?



Why It Matters







In a political shocker that would make Mar-a-Lago jealous, 33-year-old Zohran Mamdani has defeated Andrew Cuomo to win the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City. Armed not with a party machine but a ring light, Mamdani channelled the Trump playbook—minus the racism, plus the rent freeze—and turned vibe into victory.Let’s be clear: this wasn’t a campaign. It was a social-media insurgency, scripted by Karl Marx, shot by Mira Nair, and edited on TikTok.He studied Trump’s script and flipped the ideology.Donald Trump didn’t just break the political mould—he shattered it with a Twitter feed and a MAGA hat. He turned every rally into performance art, every scandal into a storyline, and every insult into a headline. Mamdani took that same understanding—that politics is now pure spectacle—and swapped the anger for aspiration. Like Trump, he didn’t drown voters in policy. He made them feel something. Trump had chants and nicknames. Mamdani had reels and subway beats. Both knew that in an attention economy, coherence is optional—what matters is dominance of the feed. One built a wall of grievance. The other, a montage of hope.Donald Trump’s 2016 primary run was defined by his ruthless use of Twitter and an instinct for spectacle that shattered political convention.He bulldozed a crowded Republican field—mocking Jeb Bush as “low energy,” ridiculing Marco Rubio as a “choke artist,” and branding Ted Cruz “Lyin’ Ted”—turning insults into headlines and tweets into strategy. While others played by the rules, Trump made up his own, bypassing traditional media and speaking directly to millions through his feed. He transformed debates into made-for-TV brawls and campaign rallies into stadium-sized performances, reducing policy to punchlines and elevating politics into a daily, chaotic spectacle.The son of postcolonial theorist Mahmood Mamdani and legendary filmmaker Mira Nair, Zohran Mamdani was born in Uganda, raised in New York, and trained in Astoria’s political trenches. As a democratic socialist assemblyman, he made his name on housing justice, transit reform, and progressive causes.But it wasn’t his platform that won. It was the performance. The myth-making. The energy. He understood what Trump knew early on: politics is entertainment. Elections are theatre. Content is king.Mamdani just gave it a Brooklyn accent and an Instagram filter.Policy? Sure. But Make It Viral.Yes, he has an agenda. A very left one.Rent freeze on stabilised units.200,000 social housing units over 10 years.Fare-free buses, faster trains, fewer cars.Tax hikes on the wealthy and elite universities to fund public childcare and free CUNY tuition.Community safety over policing.LGBTQ+ funding, gender-affirming care, and an Office for Queer Affairs.And on foreign policy? A vocal backer of Palestinian rights, BDS supporter, and critic of Israel’s Gaza policies.But the real success? He didn’t explain all this. He vibed it. Like Trump, who never published a white paper but made you feel something, Mamdani crafted mood more than message. And Gen Z showed up.Andrew Cuomo, former governor and comeback specialist, thought favours and name recognition would carry him. But he was playing by old rules.He brought endorsements. Mamdani brought edits. Cuomo parked his Dodge Charger. Mamdani parachuted in with drone footage. One was running for office. The other was producing a vertical-format revolution.And when it came to the issue of Israel—a potential Achilles heel for Mamdani—he did what Trump would do: deflect, distract, and deliver just enough ambiguity to keep everyone guessing. The Times clutched pearls. The Post clutched its usual megaphone. Mamdani? He uploaded a Reel with the caption: “I’m here to fight for dignity. Everywhere.”3.1 million views. Cuomo’s press release? Zero engagement.Mamdani heads into the general election against Republican Curtis Sliwa, a few independents, and possibly Cuomo if he goes rogue. But the script has already flipped. For decades, New York was ruled by machines—Tammany Hall, Bloomberg’s billions, the Cuomo dynasty. But in 2025, the city’s future belongs to content strategists, not campaign strategists. The new political bosses don’t organise fundraisers. They organise Discord servers.This wasn’t just a primary. It was a generational and ideological rupture. Mamdani’s win is what happens when Trump’s style fuses with left-wing substance. When grievance politics are replaced by aspirational storytelling. When the kids stop waiting for permission and start livestreaming their own revolution.If elected in November, Mamdani wouldn’t just be New York’s first Muslim or Indian-origin mayor. He’d be the first mayor to truly rule from the feed.The Trump era taught us politics was about performance. Mamdani just updated the genre. No red caps. Just red captions. No wall-building. Just storyboarding. And like any great performer, he’s just getting started.","Zohran Mamdani defeated Andrew Cuomo to win the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City.

"Turkey sandwich, sunflower seeds: Strict diet B-2 bomber pilots undergo before missions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/turkey-sandwich-sunflower-seeds-strict-diet-b-2-bomber-pilots-undergo-before-missions/articleshow/122051698.cms,"The success of B-2 bombers hinges on the crew as two pilots replace the bigger crew that older bombers required.

Pilots can't see refueling, they rely on visual cues







B-2 bomber pilots go through rigorous preparation for weeks ahead of embarking on a mission and a majority of this training includes sleep studies, retired Lt. Gen. Steve Basham told Reuters. Bhasham flew the B-2 for nine years and retired in 2024 as deputy commander of the US European Command.Basham explained that pilots are trained to be cognizant of foods which speed up their digestion, which slow it, which keep them awake, which make them fall asleep. Because there is a single chemical toilet in the aircraft and they need to take rest as well, during the 36-hour flight.For Basham, his go-to meal during the training was turkey sandwiches on wheat bread with no cheese, as bland is what they are eyeing here.B-2 bombers can fly 6,000 nautical miles without refueling but most missions require multiple mid-air refuelings and the process is cumbersome.The Reuters report described the refueling process as 'blind' as pilots can't see the boom extending from a tanker full of gas attaching to the B-2 16 feet behind their heads. They have to rely on visual cues from the tanker's lights and memorized reference points. On moonless flights, it's an inherently dangerous task, Basham said.The process is more tiring when fatigue kicks in. ""Adrenaline kept you going before you went into country,"" Basham said. ""The adrenaline goes away. You try to get a little bit of rest and you still got that one last refueling.""B-2 is equipped with a refrigerator, a microwave and a small area behind the seats where pilots can lie down in a cot. Sunflower seeds are another food the pilots rely on to stay awake between meals.B-2's shape makes it stealthy but its success largely depends on human performance, as it carries only two persons instead of larger teams that older bombers like the B-1B and B-52 required.","B-2 bombers can fly 6,000 nautical miles without refueling but most missions require multiple mid-air refuelings and the process is cumbersome.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Google Chrome will stop supporting Android 8.0 Oreo and Android 9.0 Pie starting with version 139, according to Chrome Support Manager Ellen T. The announcement was made on the official Chrome support forums. After this update – scheduled for release on August 5, 2025, Chrome will only work on Android 10 or newer, leaving users with older phones unable to receive further updates. “Chrome 138 is the last version of Chrome that will support Android 8.0 (Oreo) and Android 9.0 (Pie),” Ellen wrote in the forum.While users can continue using Chrome version 138 on their Android 8 and 9 devices, they will no longer receive new features, performance improvements, or critical security updates. Over time, this could affect the browser’s performance and leave devices more vulnerable to threats.To recall, Android 8.0 was first released in 2017, and Android 9.0 followed in 2018.

Another alternative is to switch to browsers like Firefox, which continues to support devices running Android 5.0 and above. However, compatibility varies across browsers, and some may not function properly on older systems.Ultimately, upgrading to a newer Android device is the most reliable solution to ensure ongoing support and security for apps like Chrome.","Google Chrome will stop supporting Android 8.0 Oreo and Android 9.0 Pie starting with version 139.

Australia's internet watchdog and Google-owned YouTube engaged in a spat, after the regulator urged the government to reverse its planned exemption for the video-sharing platform from a world-first ban on social media for teens. Australia aims to be the first country to fine social media companies that fail to block users under the age of 16.The government, led by Anthony Albanese, had previously indicated it would grant YouTube a waiver, citing the platform's utility for educational and health content. Other social media giants, including Meta's Facebook and Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok, have argued that such an exemption would create an unfair playing field.eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant revealed she wrote to the government last week, advocating for no exemptions when the law takes effect. She highlighted the regulator's research, which found that 37% of children aged 10 to 15 reported encountering harmful content on YouTube – the highest percentage among all social media sites surveyed.“This is not a fair fight where our kids are concerned, vis-a-vis social media sites,” Inman Grant said. She contended that social media companies employ “persuasive design features"" like recommendation-based algorithms and notifications to maximise user engagement.Inman Grant specifically accused YouTube of having “mastered those, opaque algorithms driving users down rabbit holes they're powerless to fight against.”In a swift rebuttal via a blog post, YouTube accused Inman Grant of providing ""inconsistent and contradictory advice."" Rachel Lord, YouTube's public policy manager for Australia and New Zealand, asserted that the Commissioner ""chose to ignore this data, the decision of the Australian Government and other clear evidence from teachers and parents that YouTube is suitable for younger users,"" referencing government research that found 69% of parents considered the platform suitable for those under 15.When questioned about surveys supporting a YouTube exemption, Inman Grant firmly stated her priority: ""about the safety of children and that's always going to surpass any concerns I have about politics or being liked or bringing the public onside.""","Australia aims to be the first country to fine social media companies that fail to block users under the age of 16.

'Behind-the-scenes dogfight' that is complicating troubled relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/behind-the-scenes-dogfight-that-is-complicating-troubled-relationship-between-microsoft-and-openai/articleshow/122051860.cms,"Differentiating AI assistants from OpenAI and Microsoft – a core challenge



An intense rivalry is reportedly brewing between AI powerhouse OpenAI and its largest investor, Microsoft. OpenAI’s burgeoning success in the enterprise market is reportedly causing “indigestion” for Microsoft , whose sales teams are finding themselves flat-footed while under pressure to expand the adoption of their own AI assistant, Copilot . According to a report by Bloomberg , this ‘behind-the-scenes dogfight’ is further complicating an already delicate relationship between the two tech giants.Despite investing nearly $14 billion in OpenAI, Microsoft has simultaneously diversified its AI portfolio by backing rival startups and developing its own AI models. Furthermore, Microsoft is reportedly hesitant to greenlight OpenAI's internal restructuring plan.OpenAI has been actively forging deals with competing cloud computing partners and has spent the past two years building a comprehensive suite of paid subscription products for businesses, educational institutions, and individuals.The report says that both companies are essentially pitching similar products: AI assistants designed to handle demanding tasks such as research, writing and data analysis, thereby potentially freeing up office workers to focus on more complex challenges.It is to be noted that both ChatGPT and Microsoft's Copilot are largely built upon the same underlying OpenAI models, but the report says that Microsoft's salesforce has struggled to differentiate Copilot from the much more widely recognised ChatGPT.Jared Spataro, Microsoft's chief of workplace AI initiatives, addressed ChatGPT's traction by stating that “awareness in the consumer space doesn’t necessarily translate into fit for use in the commercial space.”He emphasised that Microsoft's “sweet spot” lies in taking the best available technology and fine-tuning it specifically for business use. An OpenAI spokesperson countered that their company is benefiting from customers' desire for direct access to the latest expertise and technology, the report highlighted.Another reason is early-moving advantage. The rapid consumer adoption of ChatGPT meant that by the time Microsoft began rolling out Copilot to businesses, many office workers had already experimented with ChatGPT at home, giving OpenAI's chatbot a critical first-mover advantage.Adding to the complexity, updates from OpenAI often take weeks to appear in Microsoft's software, partly due to bureaucratic delays. Spataro, however, clarified that Microsoft conducts its own rigorous testing on each OpenAI release to ensure improved user experience and adherence to security standards.","OpenAI has been actively forging deals with competing cloud computing partners.

"The last time when Hinge founder used his own dating app, and how it helped him marry his wife",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-last-time-when-hinge-founder-used-his-own-dating-app-and-how-it-helped-him-marry-his-wife/articleshow/122050715.cms,"A flight to Switzerland changed everything



Hinge founder and CEO Justin McLeod hasn't used his own dating app as a user in over a decade, but his last experience on the platform led to one of the most dramatic love stories in Silicon Valley history.McLeod revealed during a recent interview on The Verge's Decoder podcast that he last used Hinge more than ten years ago, before the app became one of America's biggest dating platforms. What happened next reads like a Netflix romantic comedy, which it literally became, inspiring an episode of the streaming service's ""Modern Love"" series.The story begins with heartbreak. McLeod tried to win back his college girlfriend after Harvard Business School, but she rejected him. That rejection sparked the creation of Hinge in 2011. ""I started Hinge in response to that,"" McLeod told The Verge's Nilay Patel.But the plot twist came years later. Someone McLeod met on his own app inspired him to make one final attempt at love. His college ex was living in Switzerland, about to marry someone else. With just one month before her wedding, McLeod flew overseas to make his case.""She called off her wedding and moved back to New York,"" McLeod said, describing the moment that would reshape both his personal life and his company's philosophy.The dramatic reunion led to Hinge's complete reboot in 2015, when McLeod fired half his staff and rebuilt the app around its now-famous tagline: ""designed to be deleted."" The couple has been together for the past decade, married with children.This personal transformation directly influenced Hinge's business model, which prioritizes getting users off the app and onto real dates, rather than maximizing screen time like other social platforms. McLeod's romantic journey became the foundation for a dating app philosophy that puts human connection over digital engagement.","Justin McLeod hasn't used his own dating app as a user in over a decade.

What Meta said about WhatsApp ban in US House of Representatives



WhatsApp is 'security risk', so says a memo from the US House of Representatives that has reportedly banned the use of the messaging app on all government-managed devices used by the Congressional staff. Citing cybersecurity concerns , a memo from the office of chief administrative officer labeled WhatsApp as ‘high-risk’ app. The memo states, that the app lacks transparency and absence of stored data encryption. The memo also mentions that WhatsApp can be easily affected by potential vulnerabilities because of the way it handles user information.As reported by Reuters, the directive, issued by the House Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) states, “The Office of Cybersecurity has deemed WhatsApp a high risk to users due to the lack of transparency in how it protects user data, absence of stored data encryption, and potential security risks involved with its use.""The directive issued by the office of chief administrative officer directs all the staff members to uninstall WhatsApp from all House devices which include smartphone, desktop and web versions. On the other hand, the memo recommends the staff to use WhatsApp’s rival platforms such as Signal, Apple’s iMessage and FaceTime, Microsoft Teams and Amazon’s Wickr.WhatsApp’s parent company meta has disagrees with this move. The company spokesperson Andy Stone told Reuters that WhatsApp offers end-to-end encryption by default, so the company claims that the app offer better security as compared to its alternatives. “We know members and their staffs regularly use WhatsApp and we look forward to ensuring members of the House can join their Senate counterparts in doing so officially,” Andy Stone told Reuters.The ban on WhatsApp is followed by the January incident. Earlier this year, WhatsApp disclosed that Israeli spyware firm Paragon Solutions had affected dozens of users which also include journalists and civil society members. The House previously banned TikTok in 2022 over similar concerns."," memo from the office of chief administrative officer labeled WhatsApp as ‘high- risk’ app. memo states, that the app lacks transparency and absence of stored data encryption.
