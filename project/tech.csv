How to play NYT Connections



Don't analyse the connections too deeply.

The game tends to employ simple links such as sounding similar, similar spellings, or common themes.

Example: ""dear"" and ""deer"" tend to be linked by sound, not by some elaborate relationship such as predator and prey.

You have only four guesses per puzzle per day, so every guess matters.

Don't mindlessly click—consider each set carefully before submitting.

Try to come up with at least three connected words confidently before trying a set.

The initial organization is deliberately mischievous to mislead you.

Shuffling the words may allow you to see new patterns or concealed connections.

Shuffle it as a routine to begin and whenever you are stuck.

Nintendo begins sending out invites for Switch 2 pre-orders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/nintendo-begins-sending-out-invites-for-switch-2-pre-orders/articleshow/121020554.cms,"Nintendo Switch 2 demand is high

Nintendo began distributing pre-order invitations today for its highly anticipated Switch 2 console, offering select customers a chance to secure the device ahead of its June 5 launch. The My Nintendo Store is prioritizing invites to accounts with 12-month Nintendo Online subscriptions and at least 50 hours of playtime on the original Switch. Invitations will continue to be sent through May 12 while supplies last, with recipients given 72 hours to finalize their purchase.Pre-order access also includes exclusive accessories like the limited Nintendo Switch 2 GameCube controller , which will become available to all Nintendo Online subscribers starting May 13, if stock remains.The Demand will significantly outpace supply, with Nintendo expecting to sell 15 million units in the fiscal year ending March 2026. Earlier pre-order opportunities at major retailers like GameStop, Walmart, and Best Buy sold out within minutes when they launched on April 24.Adding to consumer urgency, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa recently warned that the console's $449 price tag could increase due to President Trump's tariff policies. ""Our basic policy is to recognize tariffs as a cost when determining sales prices in any country or region and to incorporate them into the price,"" Furukawa stated during an earnings call.The Switch 2 will retail for $449 for the standalone console or $499 bundled with Mario Kart World. Technical specifications include 1080p resolution in handheld mode and 4K when docked, with 256GB internal storage expandable via microSD Express cards.For those who missed retailer pre-orders, checking the My Nintendo Store regularly through May 12 is recommended, as some eligible customers may receive invitations without email notifications.","Nintendo began distributing pre-order invitations for its highly anticipated Switch 2 console today.

Sam Altman’s World Project turns Black Mirror tech into reality in six US cities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sam-altmans-world-project-turns-black-mirror-tech-into-reality-in-six-us-cities/articleshow/121022857.cms,"OpenAI's Sam Altman launched the World Project in the US on May 1, 2025, aiming to revolutionize digital identity verification using eye-scanning Orbs. This initiative seeks to create a secure, decentralized system distinguishing humans from AI. The Orb scans irises, generating encrypted IrisCodes stored on a blockchain. In exchange for participation, users receive 14 WLD cryptocurrency tokens.

World ID and Match Group partner to combat online dating fraud

Addressing privacy concerns and ethical challenges

The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and digital technologies has brought both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges, particularly in verifying online identities. In response to this, Sam Altman , the visionary co-founder of OpenAI, has introduced his latest ambitious endeavor, the World Project , in the United States. Previously known as Worldcoin, this initiative aims to revolutionize digital identity verification using biometric data, specifically through eye-scanning technology .The project, co-developed by Tools for Humanity, seeks to create a global, secure, and decentralized identity system that can differentiate humans from AI bots in an increasingly digital world. As the World Project officially launched in six US cities on May 1, 2025, it marked a significant step toward transforming online authentication and digital trust.The World Project is driven by a bold vision: to establish a universally accessible digital identity system that safeguards individual privacy while ensuring secure interactions online. The core technology behind this initiative is the Orb, a sleek, silver sphere designed to scan and encode a user’s unique iris pattern into an encrypted IrisCode. Unlike traditional username and password systems, which are vulnerable to hacking and phishing, the World ID offers a more secure alternative by using biometric data that cannot be easily replicated.Tools for Humanity, the company behind the World Project, was co-founded by Sam Altman and CEO Alex Blania. Their mission is to build a decentralized identity platform that can serve as a foundational layer for the digital economy, reducing fraud and restoring trust in online interactions. The World ID system promises to be a critical tool in combating the rise of deepfakes, AI-generated content, and bot-driven misinformation.The Orb is a key component of the World Project’s identity verification system. It captures a user’s iris pattern, transforming it into a unique IrisCode that is encrypted and stored on a blockchain. This approach offers significant security advantages:In the US, the initial rollout includes 7,500 Orbs deployed across six major cities: Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, and San Francisco. The company plans to quadruple its global hardware footprint by the end of 2025, further expanding the availability of World IDs.To encourage early adoption, the World Project offers users 14 WLD cryptocurrency tokens in exchange for participating in the iris-scanning process. These tokens, part of the broader World ecosystem, can be used for online transactions, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and digital identity verification.In addition to the Orb, the World Project is set to launch the World Card, a crypto-linked debit card developed in partnership with Visa. This card will allow users to spend their WLD tokens at any location that accepts Visa, bridging the gap between the digital and physical economies. This integration marks a significant step toward making digital currencies more practical and widely accepted.The US launch of the World Project comes with several high-profile partnerships aimed at integrating World ID into mainstream applications. Notably, Match Group, the parent company of Tinder, Hinge, and other dating platforms, is piloting World ID for identity verification on Tinder in Japan. This move is intended to reduce catfishing and online fraud by ensuring that users are verified humans. If successful, this technology could extend to other dating platforms, enhancing user trust and safety.Despite its ambitious goals, the World Project faces significant challenges, particularly around privacy and data security. Critics have raised concerns about the ethical implications of incentivizing biometric data collection with cryptocurrency rewards. Reports of coercion by Orb operators in some regions and the emergence of a black market for iris data have further complicated the project’s public perception.To address these concerns, the World Project has emphasized its commitment to transparency and data protection. The company claims that it does not store actual iris images and that its blockchain-based approach ensures that no single entity can control or misuse the data. Nevertheless, building public trust will be a critical factor in the project’s long-term success.","OpenAI's Sam Altman launched the World Project in the US on May 1, 2025.

"Titanic survivor’s haunting letter written days before sinking sells for record £300,000 at auction; here’s what it said",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/titanic-survivors-haunting-letter-sells-for-record-300000-at-auction/articleshow/120680669.cms,"



A rare letter penned by Colonel Archibald Gracie , one of the Titanic’s most distinguished survivors, has fetched a record £300,000, a fivefold increase on its estimated price, at an auction in Wiltshire, as a new high price for Titanic correspondence was smashed.The letter, dated April 10, 1912, the very day Gracie boarded the Titanic, offers a chilling glimpse into the final days before disaster struck. Written on a Titanic letter card and postmarked in Queenstown and London, it is ominous in tone, with the following ominous words: ""It is a fine ship but I shall await my journey's end before I pass judgment on her.""Auctioneer Henry Aldridge and Son described it as ""a truly exceptional, museum-grade piece,"" saying it is the record price for a Titanic letter. Survivor letters of Gracie's stature are extremely rare, with this one never previously on the market.he four-page letter, written to a family acquaintance who befriended Gracie at the London Waldorf Hotel, is warm in its reminiscence about his earlier crossings on the Oceanic, remembering, ""Her sea-worthy qualities and yacht-like appearance make me miss her,"" while also marveling at the size of the Titanic.Days later, Gracie would be a participant in one of history's most horrific nights. Following an evening of squash, a dip in the ship's pool, and a Sunday church service, Gracie was rudely awakened at 11:40 pm by the abrupt shutdown of Titanic's engines. Without hesitation, he assisted women and children into lifeboats, procuring blankets to protect them from the cold.When the ship finally went down into the Atlantic waves, Gracie crawled onto an upturned collapsible boat with other survivors. In the blackness, frantic swimmers cried out for assistance, but fear of capsizing prevented those on board from taking on more. Gracie remembered with sorrow that over half the men holding on to the upturned boat died before dawn, exhausted and chilled.""In no instance, I am happy to say, did I hear any word of rebuke,"" Gracie wrote in his later memoir, The Truth About the Titanic, recounting the final moments of those left behind, some offering blessings rather than curses.Col. Gracie's eye-witness account is still one of the most detailed and graphic accounts of the tragedy. The auctioneers titled the letter an invaluable relic, ""It is impossible to overstate the rarity of this lot,"" they added. ""Written by one of the most famous survivors, it captures a moment frozen in time.""","Col. Archibald Gracie was one of the Titanic's most distinguished survivors.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for GTA 6, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

Monaco E-Prix Round 6 highlights





Pit Boost in Formula E double-headers

Nissan driver Oliver Rowland won Part 1 of the Monaco E-Prix on Saturday. He is already leading the Formula E Drivers' Standings this year, and the much-awaited win adds to his score. Nyck de Vries of Mahindra Racing secured the second spot on the podium. Andretti driver Jake Dennis managed to claim the third spot despite a 5-second penalty.The race began with qualifying winner NEOM McLaren’s Taylor Barnard on pole position, followed by good friend — Nissan’s Oliver Rowland — and then Cupra Kiro driver Dan Ticktum, who topped both free practice sessions.The race ended early for TAG Heuer Porsche driver António Félix da Costa, who crashed into the wall and retired. He remains the only Formula E driver in the last five years to have won both pole and the race in the same event — in 2021. He had finished third in the previous race in Miami.Mitch Evans of Jaguar TCS Racing, who won the last Monaco E-Prix, came to a halt during the race and struggled to get going again, losing precious time as others overtook him.Oliver Rowland was among the first to use Attack Mode and established his dominance in the race. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries and TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein came close to Rowland when others took the mandatory Pit Boost. Soon after, Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy moved up to challenge for second position.Where did pole winner Taylor Barnard go? He crashed into the wall and was seen reversing his vehicle to rejoin the race. Andretti driver Jake Dennis could have secured a higher podium finish, but he was hit with a 5-second penalty for overspeeding during the full-course yellow when António Félix da Costa’s car was being removed from the crash site.Pit Boost is a feature introduced in Formula E double-headers. The electric Gen3 Evo cars receive a 10 percent energy boost (3.85 kWh) via a 30-second, 600kW charge in the pit lane. However, a driver can use this advantage only once across the two races in a double-header.","Nissan driver Oliver Rowland won Part 1 of the Monaco E-Prix on Saturday.

"Google’s YouTube could land exclusive NFL Week 1 game, a streaming game-changer in the works",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/googles-youtube-could-land-exclusive-nfl-week-1-game-a-streaming-game-changer-in-the-works/articleshow/121046531.cms,"NFL considers YouTube for exclusive Week 1 game, shaking up the traditional TV sports model (Credit: NFL)

Exclusive NFL game might stream on YouTube in Week 1



The NFL is gearing up to make a bold move in its evolving partnership with digital media giants. According to recent reports, YouTube is on the verge of securing exclusive streaming rights to a rare Friday night NFL game during the league’s opening weekend this year. If the deal goes through, it will mark a significant moment not just for YouTube, but for the entire sports streaming landscape.Traditionally, the NFL’s opening week kicks off with “Thursday Night Football” and stretches into the weekend, culminating in “Monday Night Football.” Friday night games are almost unheard of during the regular season, aside from select international matchups or special events like Amazon’s Black Friday game.But this new Friday game, reportedly scheduled for Week 1 and set to take place in São Paulo, Brazil, would be the first of its kind to stream on YouTube—and potentially for free.“YouTube has emerged as the heavy favorite to stream its first exclusive NFL game on Friday of the opening week,” The New York Times reported, citing unnamed sources. The outlet added, “The deal would represent another landmark agreement between the league and a behemoth digital platform that is redefining how fans watch games.”If finalized, the deal would allow YouTube to stream the game globally without requiring a paid subscription. That’s a major departure from other streaming partnerships. Amazon’s Thursday Night Football, Netflix’s Christmas Day games, and NBC’s Peacock have all typically operated behind paywalls or subscriptions. YouTube’s plan, in contrast, leans into accessibility—an effort that could broaden the NFL’s reach in untapped markets.The game, set to be held at Corinthians Arena in Brazil, will feature the Los Angeles Chargers, with their opponent yet to be announced. The matchup is expected to be part of the NFL's international series, which continues to gain traction among fans worldwide. The official announcement is likely to be made next week during the Advertising Upfronts, a crucial time when media networks roll out their biggest projects and initiatives.While this would be YouTube’s first exclusive game, the platform is already a key NFL partner. Its $14 billion, seven-year deal for the NFL Sunday Ticket has reshaped how out-of-market games are consumed. That package allows fans to catch every Sunday afternoon game aired on CBS and FOX, regardless of local broadcasting restrictions. The partnership also enables YouTube to distribute game clips and content created by football-focused influencers and creators.Unlike its digital rivals, YouTube hasn’t yet ventured into full game broadcasts in the U.S. This upcoming Friday opener, however, would change that narrative. And it could be just the beginning. As the NFL eyes future opt-outs with legacy broadcasters post-2029, and with NBA’s massive digital deals on the horizon, the league seems poised to lean even harder into the streaming revolution.As for the production, it’s still unclear who will call the game or oversee the broadcast. Streamers like Netflix have previously outsourced production duties—paying CBS to handle their Christmas games. Prime Video uses its own announcers but relies on NBC for production. Whether YouTube follows a similar route remains to be seen.Though the final price tag for the rights hasn’t been disclosed, industry chatter suggests it could rival or exceed the $105 million that NBCUniversal paid for last year’s Peacock-exclusive game between the Eagles and Packers. One thing’s certain: if YouTube lands this deal, it’ll mark a turning point in how and where fans watch NFL football.Also Read: Jerry Jones risks turning the Dallas Cowboys into the NFL's “island of misfits” with controversial trade dividing analysts and fans","Report: YouTube is on the verge of securing exclusive streaming rights to a rare Friday night NFL game.

Steelers' QB hopes in limbo as Aaron Rodgers remains non-committal about NFL return



George Pickens trade can impact Aaron Rodgers signing with Steelers | Pro Football Talk | NFL on NBC

The Pittsburgh Steelers find themselves caught in a holding pattern, anxiously awaiting clarity on whether veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers will join their ranks ahead of the 2025 NFL season. Despite swirling rumors and increasing fan speculation, no formal deal has been signed, and insiders suggest the franchise remains in the dark about Rodgers’ intentions.NFL analyst Peter Schrager shed light on the situation during a recent appearance on The Pat McAfee Show, pushing back against reports that a verbal commitment had already been made.“I don’t think there’s this assumed handshake deal that: ‘Hey, don’t worry, I’ll get there.’ They would have announced it. They would have signed him. They would have done it. I still think he’s deliberating. From what I gather, Pittsburgh knows no more now than they did at the Draft or before the Draft.”Rodgers, who turns 41 later this year, is reportedly weighing his options heavily, and retirement isn’t off the table. His recent statements about navigating personal issues and being in a new “serious relationship” suggest that football might not be his sole priority anymore. That emotional distance from the game, combined with the physical and mental toll of competing at an elite level, has sparked real concerns that he may decide to walk away.The Steelers, who recently traded star receiver George Pickens to the Dallas Cowboys, are in desperate need of a quarterback who can elevate their offense. Rodgers, despite his age, is seen as the most viable path to championship contention. His occasional visits to Pittsburgh and even a private workout session with wide receiver DK Metcalf have kept fans hopeful, but that hope is starting to wear thin with no concrete updates.The organization has remained publicly patient, likely because they understand the gravity of what a healthy and motivated Rodgers could bring. However, the lack of progress has inevitably started to raise eyebrows internally. With training camp looming and the quarterback position still unsettled, Pittsburgh may have to entertain alternatives sooner rather than later.One potential contingency plan that has emerged is Kirk Cousins. Schrager hinted that the seasoned quarterback could be a legitimate trade target if Rodgers ultimately decides not to sign. “I still think Kirk Cousins is a viable trade candidate if Aaron Rodgers doesn't land in Pittsburgh,” he noted. “I would keep an eye on that one.”Cousins, who brings consistency and starting-caliber leadership, might not carry the same star power as Rodgers but would offer the Steelers a more immediate and stable solution under center. With a roster still capable of playoff contention, Pittsburgh cannot afford to gamble indefinitely.As the offseason inches toward training camp, the Steelers face a pivotal decision: wait for Rodgers to make up his mind, or pivot and pursue someone like Cousins to avoid another year of quarterback instability. One thing is clear—if clarity doesn’t arrive soon, the Steelers' patience might run out before Rodgers makes his.Also Read: Is it time to walk away?

Protagonists:



Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2

Lucia – The series' first female mainline protagonist, offering a new take on the franchise.



Jason – Lucía's crime-and-romance partner, providing a dual-protagonist narrative with built-in tension and chemistry.



The two share hints of a Bonnie-and-Clyde-like saga of high-rolling crime thrills.



Setting:

Located in Leonida, an idealized rendition of Florida, and with Vice City as the central urban location.



The map boasts a tremendous diversity of landscapes, ranging from beaches, swamps, and country to city sprawl.



The major element is the expansion of size and complexity of the map over GTA titles past, and Rockstar hailing a ""living world"" where there are details at every corner.



Release date:



GTA 6 is officially set to release on May 26, 2026.



Although Fall 2025 was initially mentioned as the target window, Take-Two Interactive has now confirmed the updated launch date.



Confirmed platforms:



PlayStation 5



Xbox Series X|S



No mention yet of a PC release, but it’s likely that a version will be released post-launch, as was the case with GTA V and Red Dead Redemption 2.



Estimated price:



Standard edition expected to retail for around $69.99 to $79.99.



Special/Collector’s editions could range from $89.99 to $129.99 USD, including bonus content such as in-game items, maps, or physical collectibles



Final prices will be confirmed closer to launch, with possible region-specific pricing.



Game world and details:



Referenced as Rockstar's ""largest and most immersive"" open world to date, potentially larger than GTA V's map when added together with all regions.



Realistic environmental details, such as day/night cycles, advanced weather, and wildlife such as alligators and flamingos.



Crowd density and vehicle diversity will be boosted for a more realistic and immersive world.



Dynamic NPCs, with realistic behaviors and interactions, adding to a lively and responsive world.



New social media systems within the game mocking real-world platforms (Instagram, TikTok) will have gameplay and narrative impacts.



More cinematic narrative, with Rockstar urging for very intense and emotional character development.



Tone and themes:



Narrowly focused on contemporary satire, GTA 6 will take a lot from today's social media culture, influencer celebrity, and viral criminality.



The narrative will touch on themes of crime, wealth, and ambition with a definite reference to the chaotic life of contemporary Florida, particularly in cities such as Miami.



The game world will include news reports, parody advertisements, and player-generated media, all hinting at Rockstar's satirical commentary on modern society.

This new Minecraft summer drop update is designed to improve your gaming experience.In this article we will look at five confirmed changes in the upcoming summer drop.Here are the 5 quality-of-life changes from the new Minecraft summer game drop:As we all know from previously, crafting a lodestone required a rare netherite ingot, which made it a challenging item to obtain. Through the new update, players can create lodestone using iron ingots instead. The change makes it easier for the players to create lodestones, which will be useful for navigation as they allow compasses to point at specific locations.The update will also introduce new variants of familiar farm animals like cows, pigs, and chickens. These variants are adapted to different biomes, such as warm and cold climates. For example, warm pigs will appear in the arid regions, while cold pigs will be found in snowy areas. This new addition will bring more diversity and life to the game and its environment.To make the Overworld feel even more alive, the update will add ambient features like falling of dry leaves from the trees, leaf litter on the ground, and new wildflowers in various biomes. All these visual enhancements will create an immersive and very dynamic environment for the players to explore.Previously known as the barren biome, the Badlands will now be having farm animals such as pigs, cows, and chickens. Which will add more life into the area and provide players with new opportunities for farming and exploration in regions that were once abandoned.The Bedrock Edition had this often-faced problem of Endermen teleporting out of boats and minecarts, making them difficult to transport. The upcoming update addresses this issue, ensuring that the Endermen remain in boats and minecarts as intended. Through this fix, it simplifies the process of moving Endermen for various gameplay purposes.These quality-of-life changes demonstrate Mojang’s commitment to enhancing the gaming experience. The main motive of this update is to make the crafting simpler and add new animal variants, which will enrich the game’s ambiance. The developers are also fixing many long-standing issues; the upcoming update promises to make the game more fun and enjoyable for all the players.","The Minecraft summer drop has created excitement among the gamers.

“The real question is : how beautiful GTA 7 will be ?”

“That sht not coming out till 2040 AT LEAST...”

Fortnite leak hints at Simpsons mini-season and major roadmap shake-up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/fortnite/fortnite-leak-hints-at-simpsons-mini-season-and-major-roadmap-shake-up/articleshow/121033607.cms,"Image via Epic Games





Springfield may be coming to Fortnite

A stacked roadmap into 2026

A wave of new Fortnite leaks has surfaced online, teasing a lineup of upcoming content that includes themed seasons, new locations, and possibly the long-awaited Simpsons collaboration. The leak, believed to be sourced from an insider, has excited fans across the globe, revealing a roadmap packed with surprises all the way into Chapter 7.While Epic Games has yet to confirm anything officially, multiple Fortnite leakers, including trusted names like @SpushFNBR - have shared extensive details that hint at a series of themed updates, including a superhero academy season and a “Bug Invasion” theme, leading into a mini-season centred around The Simpsons.According to the leak, Fortnite's Mini-Season 2 - expected later this year, could revolve around The Simpsons, with the town of Springfield possibly arriving as a new Point of Interest (POI). Though details are scarce, there’s speculation that iconic locations like the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Krusty Burger, and Moe’s Tavern could feature in the game.This wouldn’t be Fortnite’s first adult animation collaboration. Past crossovers have included Family Guy’s Peter Griffin and characters from Futurama, and Epic’s $1.5 billion partnership with Disney in 2024 further fuels expectations for an ambitious Simpsons tie-in.If true, this would mark a significant moment in Fortnite’s long history of pop culture collaborations, with fans eager to see characters like Homer, Bart, and Marge enter the battle royale universe. Some reports even suggest Homer Simpson could headline the season’s Battle Pass.The leaked roadmap outlines content well beyond the Simpsons mini-season . Chapter 6 Season 3 is expected to focus on a Superhero Academy theme, with Midas returning as a central figure and a Superman mythic power-up debuting alongside the Fortress of Solitude as a new POI.Chapter 6 Season 4 reportedly brings a “Bug Invasion” theme, while Chapter 7 may begin with a city life and gala aesthetic, followed by a Norse mythology theme in Season 2. A Marvel-themed mini-season is also expected to return in 2026, complete with symbiote features.In addition to new seasons and characters, concerts are expected to make a return next year, with two major events also planned for 2025.While all this information remains unconfirmed, fans won’t have to wait long. Fortnite’s current Star Wars mini-season ends on June 7, and Epic is expected to announce what's next shortly after.","Leaked Fortnite roadmap hints at themed seasons, new locations, and a Simpsons mini-season.

“This isn’t a GPU problem, it’s a CPU problem”

Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 2 Tech Breakdown - Incredible Realism, Impressive RT, Astonishing Detail

Read More:

Is GTA 6 capped at 30 FPS? That answer is yet to be explored. After a long wait, Rockstar Games is finally here with the highly anticipated Trailer 2 of the game. The game sorted out a lot of loose ends that were left unstranded in the first trailer, which was released in December 2023.Needless to say, epic speculations began after the release of the latest trailer.Among all of these speculations and fan theories, the performance of GTA 6 is taking the majority of the share. So, will it be playable at 60 FPS? Or will it be capped at 30 FPS on consoles?There is no doubt that GTA 6 is going to be the most realistic title the video gaming world has ever seen. From a huge intricate open-world to expansive simulations like AI-driven NPCs, dynamic weather systems, complex traffics, the game will have everything. However, all of these extremely realistic qualities might come at a price.According to the technology editor at Digital Foundry, Richard Leadbetter, it will be challenging for the game to hit 60 FPS. In an interview with IGN , Leadbetter reminded us that every previous GTA game has targeted the 30 FPS mark first. So, if the PS5 is slated to run GTA 6 at 30 FPS, then its upgraded model, the PS5 Pro, will find it tough to run the game at 60 FPS. Because as per him,and both the consoles run on the same CPU.Digital Foundry also gave a close look at the trailer , finding it was capped at 30 FPS. Although, the trailer was a mixture of gameplay and cutscenes, and the gameplay part was very less, but still the number raises concern as the whole footage for the trailer was captured on PS5. The Digital Foundry group also claimed that the trailer footage was running between 1080p and 1440p.So, that means we might have to sacrifice the framerate for better resolution in the name of graphical fidelity, just like Bethesda did with Starfield. Right now the game is only slated to be released on newer gen consoles only, but still their hardware specification might raise eyebrows about their capabilities to run a game like GTA 6 at 60 FPS. That might not be a problem on PC though, but we are still very far from a PC launch of GTA 6.However, keep in mind that these are all just mere speculations and nothing has been confirmed by Rockstar Games yet. Even Leadbetter has stated that all of these speculations will go in vain if Rockstar is actually targeting the 60 FPS sweet spot on the base PS5. But we haven’t seen any sign of that.","GTA 6 might be capped at 30 FPS on consoles. Even newer gen consoles might not be capable enough to run GTA 6 at 60 FPS.

Fortnite's Next Season Already LEAKED?!

Superman, crossovers, and more in Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4



Fortnite CHAPTER 6 SEASON 4 LEAKED!

Fortnite Star Wars-themed season has not even wrapped up, and the rumors have already started swirling about the upcoming Chapter 6 Season 4. The insiders have hinted at the bold shift in the themes, some explosive gameplay changes, and fresh cosmetics details. While Epic Games is tight-lipped, the leaks suggest mythic abilities, superheroes, and some high-profile crossovers to dominate in the upcoming season.Here is all that’s known so far from the available leaks.The leaks have uncovered evidence that points toward an upcoming superhero-themed season with complete original character designs. With dozens of concept skins from the recent surveys, it might feature dual identities— civilian outfits transforming into the gear via in-game emotes. The leaks align with the whispers of the Hero Academy theme, where the players can unlock customizable powers, like energy-based attacks or rapid dashes.The gameplays might even see the shakeup, with the rumors suggesting some traditional weapons (guns and more)might take the backseat to the ability-driven combat. The files reference the mythic themes, including Storm Portals and Storm Claws, for teleportation and melee combat, respectively. It hints towards a season focused on strategy and mobility. If it’s all true, it will mark the most radical meta-shift of Fortnite since Zero Build mode made a debut, giving priority to creativity over the standard gunplay.The Superman collaboration is rumored to tie into the 2025 film reboot of DC. As per the claims made by the leakers, Clark Kent will be debuting as the battle pass skin, complete with the mythic ability to transform mid-fight and grant super strength or flight strength. Fortress of Solitude might even replace some existing map locations, giving new loot opportunities.Beyond Metropolis, the rumors suggest The Simpsons can land in Fortnite’s surprise mini-season with the Springfield landmarks. Symbiote-themed Marvel crossovers and Norse mythology have even been rumored for upcoming Chapter 7 with the villain named Dark Presence, quite possibly shaping the storyline. This proves that Epic Games is not slowing down on partnerships.While the teases are still unconfirmed, this will not be the first time Fortnite has tried something radical. The game’s emphasis on the pop culture synergy helps to keep Fortnite unpredictably fresh. Additionally, as June approaches, the players are already bracing up for the season that can redefine how they play Fortnite and how they will play. Also, it is possible if all rumors come true, Chapter 6 Season 4 might just become the most heroic chapter of Fortnite yet.","New skins, mythic abilities, and gameplay overhauls take over Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4.
