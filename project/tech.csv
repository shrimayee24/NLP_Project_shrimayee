Practical tech tips offer help in everyday & critical situations

It’s not every day that one wakes up to an email with ‘I need your help’ in the subject line.Morning mailers are usually a yawn. That daily newsletter, the five things “you must not miss”, new podcast notification, a bill payment reminder, a delivery alert, they’ve crowded your inbox even before you’ve started your day.So, this one stood out, more so because the sender was a stranger. Not a trick email, not a scam bait, this was a genuine request for help. A woman from Mumbai had written in, seeking advice and guidance.A day before the email landed, we had published a ‘Hack of the Day’ on how to get free legal aid through the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) portal. She had seen it. This wasn’t just a tech hack for her.The hack had done two things — allowed her to file a plea for help without stepping out of home and assured her of legal remedy for which she would not have to pay.Since we started ‘Hack of the Day’, published on the first page of Times Nation section Monday to Friday, the responses have surprised us. We conceived it as an espresso shot of technology, ‘a tech-presso’, to help our readers get practical solutions to everyday problems like blocking pesky telemarketing calls, downloading your IT return, knowing your credit score, deleting your Google location history, locking your Aadhaar biometrics, and so on.We didn’t reinvent the wheel. We merely curated available information but stripped off the jargon and cut the clutter to break it down into three-four simple tests. What we got from our readers in response went well beyond requests for further tips — those roll in daily and we’re happy to help. We heard many personal stories because the tech sits in middle of a problem and a solution.Problems present themselves differently to different people. For example, you may brush off a marketing call and block the number. Someone else, not so savvy with a phone, may fall into the trap of cybercrime. A reader from Indore reached out when he read our hack on ‘getting your phone into the DND’ – he was sick of calls from numbers he did not recognise on his phone and wanted them to stop. He read our hack but needed some handholding. “Maybe I’m too old to understand the hack,” he joked.Another hack on filing lost baggage claims with airlines drew responses that showed how fliers get shortchanged by a process that the aviation regulator has not bothered to simplify and airlines take advantage of. One reader said he was aware of the process but had received compensation far lower than the value of his damaged luggage.The most important thing we heard is that hacks have given our readers direction and agency in an environment where services are increasingly digital and solutions lie buried in creases of web pages. In moments of vulnerability, a small, well-explained piece of information can become a turning point.","Practical tech tips offer help in everyday & critical situations.

How to clear Gmail storage and keep your inbox running smoothly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/how-to-clear-gmail-storage-and-keep-your-inbox-running-smoothly/articleshow/125597081.cms,"Why does Gmail storage fill up faster than expected

How to clear Gmail storage quickly and effectively

Empty the Trash and Spam folders

Delete large emails and attachments

Remove newsletters and old promotional emails

Use the Google One Storage Manager to clear space across all services

Habits that prevent Gmail from filling up again

When you might need more storage

Running out of storage on Gmail can be stressful, especially when important emails start bouncing back or the service becomes slow. Many people do not realise how quickly storage fills up across connected Google services like Drive and Photos. Since Gmail shares its storage with the rest of the Google account, everything from attachments to uploaded files contributes to the limit. When the warning appears that storage is almost full, it can feel overwhelming. Fortunately, there are simple and practical steps that help clear space without spending money on upgrades. With a little organisation and a few smart habits, it is possible to reduce clutter and regain smooth performance in your inbox.Google provides an official Storage Manager that helps users see exactly what is taking up space across Gmail, Drive and Photos. The tool highlights large files, old emails with attachments and unnecessary items that can be deleted safely. It is the most reliable method since it works directly with data stored in the cloud rather than guessing what to remove.Gmail storage includes emails, sent items, drafts, attachments and everything stored in Google Drive and Google Photos. Even if the inbox does not appear full, large attachments or uploaded videos may be using most of the space.Promotional emails, newsletters, archived messages and old backups also count towards the total. Deleted items continue to occupy storage until they are permanently removed from Trash, which is why simply deleting emails does not always free space. When storage reaches its limit, Gmail stops receiving new mail and certain functions may not work correctly. Understanding what contributes to the total makes it easier to clean up effectively.When emails are deleted, they move to the Trash folder and stay there for up to 30 days before automatically disappearing. However, they still count towards your total storage until the Trash is emptied manually. The same rule applies to the Spam folder as well. By opening each folder and choosing the option to permanently delete all items together, users can often free up a surprising amount of valuable storage space almost instantly.Attachments are usually the biggest contributors to storage use. Gmail provides search filters that help locate bulky messages. Searching for terms like has: attachment larger:10M displays emails with attachments larger than 10 megabytes. Once these are found, they can be deleted in bulk or downloaded elsewhere before deletion.Promotional categories often accumulate thousands of unread messages because newsletters, offers and automated campaigns pile up quickly without being noticed. These can be selected and removed together to clear storage space and improve inbox performance. If many emails come from the same sender, unsubscribing prevents future build-up and keeps incoming mail manageable by stopping unnecessary notifications permanently. Over time, this simple clean-up habit reduces digital clutter, improves focus and makes it easier to find important conversations without endless scrolling or searching.The Google One Storage Manager scans all the services linked to a Google account and lists files that consume the most space. It separates storage usage into sections such as large emails, deleted items, large files in Drive and backed-up photos or videos. This approach ensures that nothing is missed, especially when files outside Gmail are the primary cause of reduced space. Through a single interface, large items can be reviewed and removed safely without confusion.Regular maintenance avoids repeat storage problems. Clearing old attachments, emptying Trash frequently and reviewing large items every few months helps maintain free space. Avoiding the habit of emailing large files repeatedly can also help. Instead of attaching high-resolution photos and videos directly to emails, it is better to share links from Drive or alternative storage platforms. This allows senders to delete the original attachments without losing access to the files. Unsubscribing from mass mailing lists also helps maintain a clean inbox.For users dealing with intensive file exchange, such as designers, editors, photographers and students, the default free storage may not be enough. In such cases, upgrading to a paid Google One plan is a practical solution. Using two Google accounts is also an option, allowing heavier tasks to be separated from regular daily email.Clearing Gmail storage does not need to be complicated. With a structured approach and support from the official Google tools, anyone can free space quickly and enjoy uninterrupted messaging. Reducing unnecessary files keeps email performance fast, improves organisation and helps stay focused without clutter.A few minutes of clean up can restore full functionality and avoid the frustration of running out of space at the wrong moment. The best approach combines one-time clean-up with regular habits that prevent build-up in the future, keeping Gmail efficient and reliable.","Gmail storage can fill up quickly, especially when important emails start bouncing back or the service becomes slow.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg welcome note

I'm excited to welcome Alan and Billy to Meta to work with me, Boz, and our team to drive this important work forward.

We're entering a new era where AI glasses and other devices will change how we connect with technology and each other. The potential is enormous, but what matters most is making these experiences feel natural and truly centered around people. With this new studio, we're focused on making every interaction thoughtful, intuitive, and built to serve people.

Alan will be joined by Billy Sorrentino, another acclaimed design lead from Apple; Joshua To, who has led our interface design across Reality Labs; our industrial design team led by Pete Bristol; and our metaverse design and art teams led by Jason Rubin.

The new studio will bring together design, fashion, and technology to define the next generation of our products and experiences. Our idea is to treat intelligence as a new design material and imagine what becomes possible when it is abundant, capable, and human-centered. We plan to elevate design within Meta, and pull together a talented group with a combination of craft, creative vision, systems thinking, and deep experience building iconic products that bridge hardware and software,” wrote Zuckerberg.

Facebook-parent Meta has announced the appointment of Alan Dye, one of Apple ’s most influential design leaders. Dye will head the newly created creative studio inside its Reality Labs division.

Since taking over Apple’s design studio in 2015, he helped shape the look and feel of flagship products including the Apple Watch, iPhone X, and the Vision Pro headset. Most recently, he oversaw Liquid Glass, Apple’s new interface design that gives UI elements a transparent, fluid aesthetic.Bloomberg, which first reported his move, noted that Dye’s team also worked on upcoming smart home hardware.","Facebook-parent Meta has announced the appointment of Alan Dye, one of Apple ’s most influential design leaders.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

"No phones, no smartwatches: Singapore tightens school rules; devices to be locked away from 2026",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/no-phones-no-smartwatches-singapore-tightens-school-rules-devices-to-be-locked-away-from-2026/articleshow/125710932.cms,"



Singapore will require all secondary school students to keep their smartphones and smartwatches locked away for the entire duration of the school day from January 2026, extending an existing restriction that currently applies only during lesson time.The ministry of education (MOE) announced the new rules on November 30, saying they are intended to curb digital distractions and promote healthier screen habits, reported Gulf news.Under the revised policy, students must store devices in lockers or bags not just during classes, but also through recess, co-curricular activities and remedial sessions. Schools may grant exceptions “where necessary,” the ministry said.Citing research on excessive screen exposure, the MOE noted that “screen use among students has been shown to displace important activities such as sleep, physical activity and social interactions.” The ministry added that reducing in-school device dependence is part of a broader effort to improve student wellbeing.Alongside the new restrictions, default ‘sleep hours’ on government-issued learning devices will shift from 11pm to 10.30pm starting January.Parents who have opted out of after-school limits have been urged to adopt the earlier cutoff at home.The move aligns with a growing global push to limit digital distractions in schools. UNESCO estimates that about 40 per cent of education systems now impose smartphone bans.

Australia’s government on Wednesday justified its social media ban for under-16s, arguing it will protect young people from being pulled into an online “purgatory.”“With one law, we can protect Generation Alpha from being sucked into purgatory by the predatory algorithms described by the man who created the feature as behavioural cocaine,” communications minister Anika Wells said, as cited by AFP.Australia is set to impose a ban from December 10, preventing users under 16 from accessing a range of major social media platforms and websites, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube.The eSafety Commissioner must be satisfied that social media platforms have taken “reasonable steps” to prevent users under 16 from holding accounts, or they could face fines of up to $49.5 million. The government has said the list of affected platforms is dynamic, meaning other services could be added later if young users shift to them and similar risks arise.The commissioner has indicated that platforms like Lemon8 could be added to the list and would be required to remove accounts for under-16 users.Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese has described social media as “a platform for peer pressure, a driver of anxiety, a vehicle for scammers and, worst of all, a tool for online predators.”Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined to disclose how it plans to identify users it “understands” to be under 16, saying doing so could potentially alert teens on how to bypass the ban.Snapchat said it will use account behavioural signals along with the birth dates provided on user accounts to identify those believed to be under 16.TikTok stated it will adopt a “multi-layered approach to age assurance” using “various technologies and signals” to verify users’ ages, adding that it will share further details ahead of December 10, as cited by the Guardian.YouTube on Wednesday criticised the ban and described the world-first legislation as “rushed” and unrealistic.""Most importantly, this law will not fulfil its promise to make kids safer online, and will, in fact, make Australian kids less safe on YouTube,"" YouTube public policy manager Rachel Lord stated, as cited by AFP.YouTube, one of the world’s most-visited websites, had initially been exempted from the ban so children could continue accessing educational content.However, in July, the Australian government reversed course, citing the need to protect young users from “predatory algorithms.”","Australia is set to impose a ban from December 10, preventing users under 16 from accessing a range of major social media platforms and websites.

Conservative commentator Steven Crowder stirred a row during a conversation about H-1B visas when he said: If India has so many bright and talented people, why do they come to the United States instead of making India an “America No. 2.”In a talk with a young man, Crowder said that if H-1B visas are so great, then why does “India still look like India?”The youth asked, “Look like India? What do you mean?”Crowder then described India in a sly way, calling it a poor and backwards country where people lack basic healthcare and necessities, where diseases still exist that developed nations eradicated, and where hundredes and thousands die from ""snake bites."" He then said, “That’s not a joke. It’s a third world country.”Steven admitted that Indians work in large numbers in tech and engineering. The youth responded that people, especially Americans should not stereotype or judge someone else’s culture and also pointed out the fact that there must be a reason for Indians to leave their own country an come work in US. He said developed countries often use the term ""third world"" to describe places that are less urbanized and that different countries have different priorities and values.Ironically, a user commented on the video of the conversation and asked Grok AI whether Steven Crowder has ever visited India. The AI replied that Steven’s experience is mostly limited to American and Canadian contexts. Social media users then called Crowder privileged and full of himself for judging a place he has never been to and for not understanding the obstacles faced in the third world.Last month, during an appearance on ""Piers Morgan Uncensored,"" Crowder called Indians ""physically feeble people,"" who should not work in construction.Steven Crowder is an American-Canadian conservative commentator known for his pushy, confrontational political style and his show ""Louder With Crowder."" He promotes mainstream right-wing positions, including tough border control, dissing progressive politics and LGBTQ issues, and vocal support for Donald Trump.

How the selection and registration works





New system upgrades and early registration





Quota, oversight, and support









Qatar is gearing up to welcome pilgrims for the Hajj 1447 AH season as the Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs (Awqaf) launches its electronic selection process. Starting December 2, 2025, the Hajj and Umrah Affairs Department will guide shortlisted applicants through a digital system designed to make registration smooth, transparent, and efficient. This initiative also gives operators the ability to plan trips effectively, ensuring top quality services for pilgrims.Pilgrims who are shortlisted will receive an SMS notifying them of their approval. Once notified, they have seven days to complete the registration process with one of the 24 accredited Hajj operators through the official website, www.hajj.gov.qa. Missing this deadline will result in automatic cancellation.During registration, applicants are required to pay an advance of QAR 10,000. This is part of the total Hajj cost, not a separate registration fee, and the final price depends on the services chosen, including accommodation and transportation. Pilgrims must also sign an electronic contract selecting their preferred operator through the online system.The advance payment ensures that applicants are serious about performing Hajj.It also helps operators plan their trips carefully, making sure all arrangements are ready for pilgrims’ arrival. Applicants are encouraged to review the services and costs of each operator, as they may vary in terms of residency, hospitality, and transportation.This year, the electronic system comes with a smoother online payment mechanism, allowing pilgrims to pay comfortably according to the prices set by their chosen operator. Building on the success of previous seasons, early registration is now open, giving operators the chance to finalize contracts and organize trips well in advance.These upgrades aim to provide a seamless pilgrimage experience. Pilgrims can focus on performing Hajj in a calm and organized setting while benefiting from high quality services.Qatar’s quota for this season is set at 4,400 pilgrims. The electronic selection process fully respects this allocation and follows established standards. Awqaf is working closely with the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah in Saudi Arabia, along with other relevant authorities, to ensure the pilgrimage runs smoothly and meets the expectations of Qatar’s pilgrims.For any questions about registration, selection, or services, pilgrims can contact the hotline at 132. The ministry emphasized that these coordinated efforts reflect its commitment to providing an organized, transparent, and fulfilling Hajj experience for all pilgrims from Qatar.","Qatar is gearing up to welcome pilgrims for the Hajj 1447 AH season.

Qatar's Hayya Visa upgrade

Two months and multiple entries

Extended Stay: Residents of GCC nations (including the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, and Kuwait) can now stay in Qatar for up to two months (60 days) on a single Hayya visa application. This extended duration provides ample time for visitors to explore cultural sites, natural attractions, and the packed calendar of year-round events.



Multiple-Entry Access: The new visa grants multiple-entry access. This means visitors can travel in and out of Qatar throughout the season without needing to reapply each time, greatly facilitating short, frequent trips for events or weekend getaways from neighboring countries.



What is the Hayya Platform?

Integrated Services: Hayya integrates visa processing with other essential travel elements, including event access, accommodation booking, transport planning, and general lifestyle services



Official Entry Document: Originally launched for the 2022 FIFA World Cup , the Hayya system successfully processed entry permits for millions of fans, and it continues to serve as the mandatory entry document for specified categories of visitors, including those utilizing the new GCC Resident Visa (A2).



Why did Qatar make the move?





From 30 November 2025, Qatar expanded the Hayya GCC Resident Visa (A2): eligible residents of GCC countries can now stay in Qatar for up to two months and enter the country multiple times during the visa’s validity. The update was announced by Qatar Tourism in coordination with the Ministry of Interior and the committee managing visitor entry as the country prepares for a busy winter of sports and cultural events.Qatar has rolled out significant enhancements to its Hayya GCC Residents Visa (Category A2), dramatically simplifying travel for expatriates living across the Gulf. These changes, which officially took effect on November 30, 2025, are specifically designed to support the expected surge in regional visitors and streamline entry during Qatar's busy season of international events.The updates, announced by Qatar Tourism in partnership with the Ministry of Interior, aim to reinforce the country’s position as a regional tourism hub. They mark a key moment for the Hayya platform, which serves as Qatar's official digital e-visa gateway, uniting visa processing with essential travel and lifestyle services into a single, comprehensive interface.The core of the Hayya update offers two major benefits that significantly improve flexibility and convenience for GCC residents:This updated system is engineered to ensure smoother entry through all ports of arrival, air, land, and sea, strengthening Qatar's operational readiness during peak visitor periods.The name ""Hayya"" (هَيّا) literally translates from Arabic to ""Let's Go!"" or ""Come On!"", perfectly reflecting its purpose as Qatar’s main facilitator for welcoming visitors.The platform is far more than just a visa application portal. It serves as Qatar's unified official digital e-visa gateway, designed to provide a seamless travel experience from the moment a visitor plans their trip:This comprehensive, digital-first approach embodies Qatar's vision to modernize its tourism sector and make entry into the country as efficient and appealing as possible.The timing of the Hayya upgrade is strategic, coinciding with a high-profile season of sports and cultural activities set to draw large crowds from the GCC region.The primary immediate driver is the 2025 FIFA Arab Cup. By simplifying access for regional fans, Qatar aims to maximize spectator numbers for this major tournament. The move also supports a vibrant line-up of surrounding cultural and entertainment events, encouraging attendees to extend their stays beyond the stadiums.Saeed Al Kuwari, Director of Hayya, emphasized that the new measures are more than just procedural tweaks.

Driving in the UAE comes with responsibilities, and the Black Points System is at the heart of keeping roads safe for everyone. Introduced to curb reckless driving and reduce accidents, it assigns points to your license for traffic violations. Accumulating these points can lead to hefty fines, vehicle impoundment, or even license suspension. For both residents and visitors, understanding how black points work, which violations carry them, and how to check your status is essential. Staying informed can help you avoid penalties and ensure a smoother, safer driving experience across all emirates.Black points are penalties assigned to a driver’s license for traffic violations. Introduced in July 2017 under Ministerial Resolution No. 178/2017, the system applies across all UAE emirates, including Dubai and Abu Dhabi.Violations are recorded using an advanced network of cameras, radars, and AI-powered monitoring systems. Once a violation is detected and confirmed, drivers typically receive an SMS notification within 48 hours detailing the offense, the fine, and the number of black points added.The system is designed not only to penalize drivers financially but also to track repeat offenses, which can ultimately lead to license suspension or mandatory retraining. It ensures safer roads and consistently encourages responsible driving behavior, moreover supporting long-term compliance.The UAE uses a 24 point scale to manage driving penalties:License suspension periods are based on how many times the 24 point limit is reached:Drivers can monitor their black points in several ways:In addition to black points, violations can also result in hefty fines, vehicle impoundment, and a daily impoundment fee of Dh100.The UAE enforces 143 federal traffic laws, each with penalties to maintain road discipline. Some of the most common violations include:These penalties are carefully designed to encourage responsible driving and protect all road users.Checking your black points is simple and can help you avoid penalties:Regular monitoring ensures you are aware of your points and prevents unexpected license suspensions or retraining requirements.By following these practices, drivers can stay safe, avoid fines, and prevent their license from being suspended.","Black points are penalties assigned to a driver’s license for traffic violations.

“Tommy just lost 50% of his supporters with this one move!”

“Nick Fuentes defends extremism abroad while aiming at the wrong targets at home.”

“People are saying the timing of his Israel trip explains everything — and it’s no coincidence.”

“Fuentes is a Qatari-backed spy-op sent to split the movement — wake up!”

“Shouldn’t you be focusing on England instead of picking fights online?”

“He’s part of the very system he claims to fight against.”

“Fuentes has answered the January 6 question countless times — stop trying to paint him as a fed.”

“America has no idea how Islamic communities operate — Tommy needs to get on US podcasts and explain it.”

“Fuentes has no clue what it’s like living near Islamic neighbourhoods — he’s speaking from a bubble.”

“Your constant alignment with Israel is hurting your own cause — this isn’t helping you.”





A new online dispute has broken out between Tommy Robinson and American commentator Nick Fuentes, after Fuentes referred to Robinson as a “Zionist tool” in a circulating clip.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets. The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Meet Charlie Javice: Woman who scammed JP Morgan for $175M — but the bank is paying her $142M legal bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meet-charlie-javice-woman-who-scammed-jp-morgan-for-175m-but-the-bank-is-paying-her-142m-legal-bills/articleshow/125369591.cms,"How a startup deal turned into a massive fraud

A conviction that didn’t stop the bills

The controversial expenses

Why JPMorgan cannot simply stop paying

Charlie Javice’s story sounds almost too bizarre to be real: a young fintech founder who tricked JPMorgan into buying her startup for $175 million, ended up convicted of fraud, and is now serving a prison sentence, yet the same company she scammed is still paying more than $142 million for her legal bills, including questionable expenses like luxury hotel upgrades and “cellulite butter. ”Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid. When JPMorgan considered acquiring the startup in 2021, she reportedly presented the bank with millions of supposed student user accounts. Prosecutors later revealed that these numbers had been fabricated, with Javice allegedly hiring a data scientist to generate fake profiles to inflate Frank’s value.JPMorgan completed the acquisition believing Frank had more than four million users, only to discover after the deal that the platform had a tiny fraction of that. The bank alerted authorities, and by 2023 Javice was arrested on federal fraud charges.In March 2025, Javice was convicted of multiple fraud counts and sentenced to more than seven years in prison. But here’s where the story takes an unusual twist: despite defrauding the bank, she is still allowed to bill JPMorgan for her legal defence because of an indemnification clause included in the acquisition agreement.This contractual protection, which is common in startup buyouts, requires JPMorgan to cover certain legal costs for former executives of Frank.As a result, the bank has already paid over $142 million in defence expenses for Javice and her former colleague Olivier Amar.The clause itself is a standard feature in mergers, designed to protect executives from being financially ruined by lawsuits connected to their time at the company. In normal situations, it is meant to ensure fairness and prevent frivolous legal targeting after an acquisition. But in this case, it has trapped JPMorgan in a bizarre obligation: they must keep funding the defence of someone who defrauded them.Had the bank conducted even a simple, early-stage verification of Frank’s user data—such as requesting direct access to the platform’s actual customer records or running a basic audit—this entire dispute could have been avoided. Instead, delayed due diligence and overconfidence in the startup’s claims set the stage for a costly legal mess that continues years after the fraud was uncovered.JPMorgan’s frustration has grown as the legal bills have ballooned. The bank claims the expenses submitted include personal items such as cellulite butter, first-class travel upgrades, and hotel luxuries. Its lawyers argue that the billing records contain “extreme abuses,” including claims for work hours that seem physically impossible.Javice’s spokesperson denies that she personally submitted these questionable charges, stating that her legal team is responsible for all billing decisions.Even though Javice has already been convicted, she is now appealing her case, and the indemnification clause means the bank must continue paying her legal fees unless a court orders otherwise. JPMorgan is currently trying to convince a Delaware judge to halt these payments, arguing that the system is being misused.The saga has become a major lesson in the risks of fast-paced startup acquisitions. JPMorgan’s failure to properly verify Frank’s user base before buying the company has left it entangled in one of the most embarrassing and expensive due diligence failures in recent corporate history.","Charlie Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including Squid Game Unleased which hit #1 in 26 countries. You’ll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles – they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through. As for Bill, Scott and me – we’re going to take a little breather before tackling whatever is next.

Dream11 pivots to a second screen sports platform,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/dream11-pivots-to-a-second-screen-sports-platform/articleshow/125772219.cms,"



Bengaluru: India’s fantasy sports giant, Dream11 , is reinventing itself as a second-screen platform for live sports. It is pitching a new watch-along app that sits alongside broadcasters such as JioCinema and Disney+ Hotstar, rather than streaming matches itself.India’s Online Gaming Bill, passed in August, effectively outlawed Dream11’s core business overnight by imposing a blanket ban on real-money online games, including fantasy sports, poker, and rummy, and barring banks and UPI from processing any such transactions. The legislation explicitly overrode earlier court rulings that treated fantasy as a skill game and carries jail terms and crore-level fines for companies, promoters, and even endorsers who continue to offer money-based contests.Harsh Jain, co-founder and chief executive of parent Dream Sports, told reporters that the new Dream11 is designed as a “second screen dominator experience” that becomes “the best friend” of first-screen broadcasters, much as fantasy sports once boosted viewership. Instead of paid contests, the app hosts live watch-along rooms where creators provide partisan commentary and banter while users track integrated scoreboards, chat, buy virtual shout-outs, or pay to join influencers on stage.“We are moving away from the whole gaming piece altogether,” Jain said, stressing that even where Dream Sports owns rights through its streaming service FanCode, “we will not show their streams” on the new app because it is “meant to be a second-screen sports entertainment platform.”He argued that fantasy sports had a “very positive effect” on viewership and that second-screen engagement can lift sports consumption sharply compared with passive TV watching. The company is launching with around 25 curated creators but plans to open the platform over time, betting that Dream11’s 20-30 million monthly free-to-play users will give influencers instant audiences that rival or exceed watch-along streams on YouTube and Twitch. “No creator wants to come and go live with like 10 people watching,” Jain said. “We have a chance that when we go live for the first match, any creator can come and see a hundred thousand people, maybe a million people have watched them.” Jain cast the product as a fix for what he called the “broken experience” of watching matches alone in a world of nuclear families and scattered friend groups. Fans, he said, want to “watch a match alone at home” but “never want to watch it actually alone,” and are now using WhatsApp, X, and Instagram as crude workarounds.The new Dream11 aims to capture that energy in one place, letting users “watch a match alone together” with the funny or outspoken voices they wish official commentators could be.","India’s fantasy sports giant, Dream11, is reinventing itself as a second-screen platform for live sports. It is pitching a new watch-along app that sits alongside broadcasters such as JioCinema and Disney+ Hotstar, rather than streaming matches itself. Instead of paid contests, the app hosts live watch- along rooms where creators provide partisan commentary.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,resizemode-4/47529300.jpg"
Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin will use moon dust to power its rockets: What is it and how it will work,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-will-use-moon-dust-to-power-its-rockets-what-is-it-and-how-it-will-work/articleshow/125768369.cms,"Blue Origin is developing an AI-powered device to convert moon dust into a power source, tackling the challenge of the two-week lunar night. This lunar vacuum, created with Istari Digital's technology, extracts heat from dust, acting like a battery. AI was crucial in designing the device, ensuring all requirements and standards were met for operational use.

“So what it does is sucks up moon dust and it extracts the heat from it so it can be used as an energy source, like turning moon dust into a battery.

Kind of like vacuuming at home, but creating your own electricity while you do it.”

How AI was used to develop Blue Origin’s moon dust battery

""fence around the playground""

""Within that playground, AI can generate to its heart's content,""

""In the case of Blue Origin's moon battery, [it] doesn't tell you the design was a good one, but it tells us that all of the requirements were met, the standards were met, things like that that you got to check before you go operational,""





Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin is planning to use moon dust to power its rockets. The Amazon founder-owned rocket company that competes with Elon Musk’s SpaceX has unveiled a new artificial intelligence (AI) powered device that can convert moon dust into an energy source. This lunar vacuum, which was presented at Amazon’s ReInvent 2025 conference in Las Vegas, was developed using technology from the startup Istari Digital. Will Roper, the startup’s CEO, explained that the device works by sucking up moon dust and extracting its heat, effectively converting the dust into a battery-like power source.This technology is critical for overcoming the challenges posed by the two-week-long lunar night (which occurs every 28 days). This is a period when the moon goes into darkness, and its surface experiences extreme temperature drops. This period typically damages or disables spacecraft hardware operating on the Moon’s surface, as it lacks a robust, long-lasting power supply.In a statement to CNBC, Roper said,Roper, who served as assistant secretary of the Air Force during President Donald Trump's first term, said that the battery was designed entirely using AI. He is also recognised for changing how the Air Force and the newly formed Space Force buy and develop equipment.A key part of Istari's technological advancement is its ability to control and reduce AI hallucinations, which occur when AI makes up false information.Roper explained that the platform takes all the requirements a part needs and creates boundaries or athat the AI cannot cross while creating designs.he explained.Roger added.Istari is supported financially by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and already partners with the US government. The startup has been serving as the main contractor for Lockheed Martin on the experimental X-56A unmanned aircraft.","Blue Origin is developing an AI-powered device to convert moon dust into a power source, tackling the challenge of the two-week lunar night.
