Elon Musk’s xAI studio aims to create innovative AI-generated video games



Experts warn AI content creation cannot match human creativity and vision



Musk’s Grok aims for AI movies while raising copyright and ethical concerns

In the rapidly evolving world of AI-powered content, Elon Musk has taken a bold step forward. On October 5, 2025, he unveiled Grok Imagine Version 0.9, a major update to his AI platform designed to generate text, images, and videos with unprecedented speed, accuracy, and realism across multiple creative formats, including virtual reality environments and interactive storytelling. This launch comes just days after OpenAI’s Sora 2 release on September 30, intensifying the competition in AI video generation, creative technology, and immersive digital experiences.Musk’s announcement underscores his ambition to transform both the entertainment and gaming industries through generative AI, while also sparking debate about the potential limitations, job displacement, societal impact, and ethical considerations of AI-generated content.Grok Imagine 0.9 introduces several cutting-edge improvements that make AI content generation faster and more versatile than ever. Musk detailed these features on X (formerly Twitter):These upgrades highlight Musk’s goal of creating a multi-functional AI platform capable of producing movies, short videos, and interactive media at scale.Musk’s vision extends beyond video and image creation. In a recent X post, he revealed that his xAI game studio plans to release a “great” AI-generated video game before the end of 2026.A shared clip demonstrated a rudimentary first-person shooter, reminiscent of popular titles like Call of Duty, showcasing the potential of AI in gaming.To further this initiative, xAI is actively hiring a Video Games Tutor, offering $45–$100 per hour to train Grok to produce “engaging, fun, and innovative video games.” The role emphasises AI-assisted game design, including accurate annotations, iterative testing, and fostering interactive entertainment. This development aligns with industry trends. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney predicts that AI prompts will allow small development teams to create games on the scale of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, unlocking entirely new genres and gameplay experiences previously impossible without AI.Despite the excitement, many industry experts remain cautious about AI’s creative capabilities. Michael “Cromwelp” Douse, publishing director at Larian Studios, emphasized that AI cannot replace human leadership, vision, or storytelling. According to Douse, AI-generated content may lack the emotional resonance and artistry required to truly engage audiences.Critics also point to the challenge of maintaining cultural and creative authenticity in both video games and movies. While AI can produce technically perfect results, the human touch—the skill, imagination, and cultural insight—remains central to crafting meaningful experiences.Musk’s ambitions are equally significant in the film industry. He recently predicted that Grok will produce a movie that is “at least watchable before the end of next year” and will deliver high-quality films by 2027. A six-second video clip of generic Hollywood-style action accompanied the tweet, illustrating the AI’s growing cinematic capabilities.However, generative AI in movies has sparked controversy. The emergence of AI-generated actors, such as Tilly Norwood, has elicited backlash from Hollywood. Furthermore, concerns about copyright infringement persist, as AI platforms—including Grok—have faced legal challenges for generating content using copyrighted characters. For instance, Grok-generated images of Nintendo’s mascot were removed from Twitter due to takedown notices. Disney and Universal have also taken legal action against AI companies for unauthorized use of their characters. Grok Imagine 0.9 represents a pivotal moment in AI content generation, bridging the worlds of video, film, and gaming. Musk’s predictions indicate a future where AI can create movies, games, and interactive experiences with unprecedented speed, while also raising questions about ethics, creativity, and copyright.Industry experts argue that while AI is a powerful tool, human creativity and oversight remain essential. The future of AI-driven filmmaking and gaming will likely involve a hybrid approach, combining AI’s technical efficiency with the artistry and vision of human creators.","Elon Musk’s Grok Imagine 0.9 boosts AI video, text, and image creation.

“Our research shows that 59% of consumers have some interest in purchasing GTA 6, highlighting the appeal and commercial potential of the game,”

“This notoriety also makes GTA 6 the perfect test case to understand consumer expectations around video game pricing. Our findings should serve as a caution to game developers looking to raise game prices in the future,”





GTA 6 is expected to generate more revenue at the standard $70 price point than at a higher $100 price, a new analysis claims. A study by MIDiA Research (seen by IGN) suggests that pricing the highly anticipated game at $100 would deter potential buyers and ultimately result in lower overall earnings for developer Rockstar.said Perry Gresham, co-author of the report and Head of Data at MIDiA Research. “A $100 price point would actually leave money on the table,” he added.The study also indicates that raising the game’s price beyond $70, which it describes as an “optimum” point, could lead to lower revenue due to fewer people buying GTA 6.said co-author and Games Analyst at MIDiA, Brandon Sutton.Sutton added.According to the survey results from over 2,000 US consumers, 60% of those interested in GTA 6 said they would ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ purchase the game at $69.99. To compare, 35% said they would ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ buy it at $99.99.The study also found that only 16% of consumers would buy the game at $149.99, while 79% of those interested in GTA 6 said they would ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ purchase it at $49.99.Rockstar is expected to announce the game’s official price closer to its release date, which is set for May 26, 2026.

“Intel has unfortunately been punished on a few areas.”

What Arm CEO Rene Haas said about Intel’s missed opportunities



“There are long product cycles. It takes a long time to develop chips.

It takes a long time to invest in fabs. It takes a long time to define architectures and ecosystems. If you miss a few time is very…you will be punished for that. I think Intel has unfortunately been punished on a few areas. They were punished on mobile, obviously, they missed that completely. They were also punished in terms of manufacturing of going to EUV, an advanced methodology for building the smallest chips on the planet.

They decided not to invest in that probably a decade ago at the rate that TSMC did, and they fell behind.”

“Once you fall behind in chips, it's very difficult to catch up because the cycle gets on top of you. TSMC now has the best fabs in the world. The leading-edge companies, Apple, NVIDIA, AMD, they all build at TSMC. TSMC gets better at what they're building. An Intel, a Samsung, they don't get the opportunities. It just compounds. And that flywheel once it compounds and it compounds, it's very hard to catch up in a series of position,”

Rene Haas on cultural divide in semiconductor industry



“I mean, we may have had it a generation or so ago. I don't know that we have it now. And we certainly haven't trained a generation of folks to look at manufacturing jobs as being something that is as lucrative and prestigious. They're sort of thinking, ‘Oh, it's a blue collar job. I don't want to go into that way.’ It's not viewed that way in Taiwan, right? And in Taiwan, if you say you're working for TSMC or studying to go off and do that, it's a highly prestigious kind of thing,”





Arm CEO Rene Haas suggested that Intel could face challenges in matching TSMC’s position as a major chip foundry. The chief executive of the UK-based semiconductor and software design company stated that once a company falls behind in the semiconductor industry, recovery is an uphill climb. In a recent All-in Podcast, Haas, while commenting on the debate about whether Intel could serve as a viable US-based alternative to the Taiwanese chip manufacturer, said thatHe also pointed out the opportunities that the US-based chip maker missed, explaining why all the leading companies like Apple and Nvidia are flocking to build from TSMC.At the podcast, Haas said:Haas explained.In addition, Haas noted cultural differences in how manufacturing is viewed, stating that while such jobs are respected in Taiwan, they are often perceived as less appealing in the West, which could impact the long-term stability of US manufacturing.he noted.","Arm CEO Rene Haas suggested that Intel could face challenges in matching TSMC’s position as a major chip foundry.

Fun and Effective Play Tips

Completing the- featuring Solosis, Duosion, and Reuniclus - requires careful timing, strategy, and participation in special events like the October 2025 Community Day. This event is a golden opportunity for Trainers to secure these rare forms, with drastically boosted shiny odds and frequent Solosis spawns. Here’s everything you need to know, from shiny rates and visual differences to evolution mechanics and the overall value of the hunt.Under normal circumstances, Shiny Solosis is an extremely rare find, with odds hovering around 1 in 512 encounters. However, during Community Day events, those odds skyrocket - typically to about 1 in 24 encounters. The October 12, 2025, Community Day, running from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. local time, will make shiny Solosis far more attainable for active players.The event also comes packed with bonuses beyond just shinies. Trainers can enjoy triple Stardust rewards for catches and double Candy gains, adding major incentive to stay out and play. Those who purchase the optional paid Special Research ticket will also unlock guaranteed Solosis encounters and enhanced shiny check opportunities.Using Lure Modules and Incense during this window will significantly increase the frequency of Solosis spawns, giving shiny hunters more chances to strike gold.The shiny Solosis line features subtle color variations that might be easy to miss at first glance. Shiny Solosis trades its typical green hue for a faint bluish-green tone, while its evolutions - Duosion and Reuniclus - follow a similar palette shift. Although the differences are mild, they make the family distinct in their own understated way. Some fans have humorously compared Duosion’s appearance to a “poop emoji,” emphasizing the quirky look of the shiny form.Once you’ve secured enough Shiny Solosis, completing the full shiny evolution line is straightforward. Solosis evolves into Duosion using 25 candies, and Duosion further evolves into Reuniclus with 100 candies. Catching and transferring extra Solosis or setting one as your walking buddy can help you quickly gather the needed Candy.For those interested in exclusive moves, evolving Duosion into Reuniclus during or up to four hours after the Community Day event grants the special fast move “Charm.” While it adds collector appeal, it doesn’t drastically change Reuniclus’s battle performance.During the October 2025 Community Day, Solosis will dominate wild spawns, making it the prime opportunity to catch its shiny version. Outside the event, shiny Solosis remains exceedingly rare and nearly impossible to find, so taking advantage of the Community Day is crucial for collectors. Additional Solosis encounters will also be available through event-themed Field Research and Timed Research tasks, all of which can result in shiny finds.For those unable to play extensively during the event, windy weather conditions can increase Solosis encounter rates on regular days - though weather boosts only affect spawn frequency, not shiny odds.From a collector’s perspective, the answer is a resounding yes. Community Day events like this one are among the few chances to complete entire shiny evolution lines, and with Solosis’s limited availability outside these windows, missing the event could mean waiting a long time for another opportunity. The chance to obtain Reuniclus with its exclusive move also adds value for future collection or trade potential.From a competitive standpoint, however, Reuniclus doesn’t shine as brightly. Even with event-exclusive moves, it ranks relatively low across major battle formats like Great League, Ultra League, and raids. The main draw for this shiny family lies in its rarity, trade appeal, and visual novelty rather than raw battle strength.To maximize your shiny haul, adopt a quick-check method - tap on a Solosis to see if it’s shiny, and if not, flee and move to the next one. This technique helps you cycle through encounters rapidly, improving your odds within the short event window.Players can also take themed AR photos of their shiny Solosis for fun “cell-fie” moments, often rewarded with special backgrounds or small event bonuses. Community Days are also social highlights in Pokemon GO, so joining local groups or meetup events can make the grind both more productive and enjoyable.Also read: Pokemon GO Solosis Community Day Preparation Guide: All Bonuses, Best Tips and Tricks, Shiny Odds, Exclusive Moves, and More The Solosis Community Day in October 2025 is a standout event for both casual players and dedicated shiny hunters. With boosted spawn rates, sharply improved shiny odds, and a few exclusive rewards on the side, it’s the best - and possibly only - chance in the near future to complete the entire shiny Solosis evolutionary line. Whether for the thrill of the hunt or the bragging rights that come with showcasing a full shiny family, this is one event no Trainer should miss.","Shiny Solosis is an extremely rare find, with odds hovering around 1 in 512 encounters. During Community Day events, those odds skyrocket - typically to about 1 in 24 encounters. The October 12, 2025, Community Day will make shiny Solosis far more attainable for active players. Trainers can enjoy triple Stardust rewards for catches and double Candy gains.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124494098,imgsize-96046,width-400,resizemode-4/pokemon-go-solosis.jpg"

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

UAE announces new Eid Al Etihad brand rules from Abu Dhabi



54th Eid Al Etihad brand rules: dos and don’ts

Logo forms: There are three official logo versions: primary (no frame), a framed version, and a negative (light on dark) version. Use the one that fits your background.

Colours & emblems: The system uses three palettes — Flag Palette (UAE flag colors), Heritage Palette (neutral cultural tones) and a Seven Emirates Palette (each emirate has a defining color and keyword). Seven emblems (palm, dhow, sun, traditional dances, fort, pearl oysters) represent emirates’ identities.

Typefaces: Use the prescribed fonts — Vinyl for English and Athelas Arabic Variable for Arabic to keep text readable and authentic.

Practical do’s: Download the correct logo file, respect minimum size rules (so the logo stays legible), place on uncluttered, high-contrast backgrounds, and follow spacing rules.

Practical don’ts: Don’t stretch, rotate, recolor, add drop-shadows or combine the logo with other logos unless an approved co-branding layout is provided. Don’t use the logo as a random pattern or translate the logotype into other languages.

What residents and businesses need to know

Residents / families: Want to decorate your home or block? Download the right logo and palette, print flags on plain backgrounds, and avoid altering the symbol. For event invites, use the official recommendations where possible.

Small businesses: If you plan to decorate a shopfront, banner or package with Eid Al Etihad identity, follow the spacing/minimum-size rules. If you need co-branding (your logo + Eid logo), check the guideline examples or seek approval through official channels.

Designers & makers (open call): The Eid Al Etihad Team opened a call for creatives to design official merchandise. Application window: Sept 17 – Oct 17, 2025. Winners’ designs may be used in the official collection. Apply through the EidAlEtihad website or official social links.

The relevance of the 54th Eid Al Etihad and its history





The UAE has released the official brand guidelines for the 54th Eid Al Etihad (National Day) so everyone, families, shopkeepers, schools and designers can celebrate in one clear style. The rules explain the logo, colours, what’s allowed (and what isn’t), and how you can take part in month-long festivities from Flag Day to Eid Al Etihad.The Eid Al Etihad 54th brand guidelines were officially unveiled by the UAE Government Media Office (GMO) in Abu Dhabi. The announcement came as part of the country’s preparations for the 54th National Day celebrations, set for December 2, 2025.The UAE Government Media Office — the body responsible for shaping and managing the nation’s official campaigns shared the full branding manual through the official Eid Al Etihad website (EidAlEtihad.ae) and its social media platforms. The release included detailed directions on logo use, design elements, colour codes, fonts, and prohibited alterations, aimed at ensuring that all individuals, institutions, and businesses represent the UAE’s identity consistently during the celebrations.Government entities, schools, private companies, and even content creators are encouraged to follow these national branding standards, reflecting the spirit of unity and national pride as the UAE marks 54 years of the Union.The guidelines exist so all decorations and posts look consistent and respectful. Key points in plain language:Eid Al Etihad, also known as UAE National Day, celebrates the union of the seven emirates — Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, Ras Al Khaimah, and Fujairah which officially took place on December 2, 1971. This year marks the 54th anniversary, a milestone reflecting over half a century of national growth, unity, and shared achievements.The day is a reminder of the UAE’s journey from a group of small, separate sheikhdoms into a modern, unified nation with strong economic, cultural, and social foundations. Traditionally, the celebrations include flag-raising ceremonies, official parades, cultural performances, and community events, fostering national pride among residents and citizens alike. For everyday residents, the 54th Eid Al Etihad is more than official ceremonies it’s a month-long festival of lights, decorations, and family-friendly activities, where people can connect with the country’s heritage while celebrating the spirit of unity, progress, and identity that has defined the UAE for 54 years.For comprehensive information, including downloadable brand assets, guidelines, and participation details, visit the official Eid Al Etihad website","UAE releases 54th Eid Al Etihad brand guide — here’s what to do, avoid and how families and designers can join the fun.

BRUSSELS: The EU Friday demanded digital giants including Snapchat and YouTube explain how they are protecting children from online harm, as all but two member states signalled openness to restricting social media access for minors.The European Union has stringent rules regulating the digital space, including what children should be able to see, but there is increasing concern that more needs to be done. Inspired by Australia’s social media ban for under-16s, Brussels is analysing whether to set bloc-wide limits on minors’ access to platforms — with 25 of 27 EU countries coming out Friday in support of at least studying such a measure.Europe’s biggest weapon for ensuring platforms tackle illegal content and keep children safe online is the Digital Services Act, which has sparked censorship claims from the US tech sector and retaliation threats from President Donald Trump.Now, as part of “investigative actions” under the DSA, the European Commission has sent a request for information to Snapchat about what steps it is taking to prevent access for children under 13.The commission has also asked Apple ’s App Store and the Google Play marketplace to provide details on measures taken to prevent children downloading illegal or harmful apps — for example, those with gambling services or sexual content.",EU demands digital giants including Snapchat and YouTube explain how they are protecting children from online harm.

"Secrets beneath sands: 3,000-year-old sacred island discovered under Egypt’s Karnak Temple",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/secrets-beneath-sands-3000-year-old-sacred-island-discovered-under-egypts-karnak-temple/articleshow/124451238.cms,"Image: Pixabay

Egypt’s Karnak temple was built on a primeval island

Engineering the landscape of the gods



Unveiling Egypt’s river secrets

A new chapter in Karnak’s history





For centuries, the vast Karnak Temple complex near Luxor has stood as one of ancient Egypt’s most enduring mysteries. Now, new research has revealed astonishing secrets hidden deep beneath its foundations. A geoarchaeological study published in Antiquity in October 2025 has uncovered evidence that the temple was originally built on a natural river island more than 3,000 years ago. Led by Dr. Angus Graham of Uppsala University and Dr. Ben Pennington of the University of Southampton, the study used 61 sediment cores and tens of thousands of pottery fragments to reconstruct the temple’s ancient landscape, revealing a sacred island that shaped Egypt’s religious and architectural evolution.The study found that around 2520 BCE, shifts in Nile River channels created a raised island about 500 metres east of the modern Nile. This island later became the foundation of Karnak Temple. Ancient Egyptians saw this “primeval mound” as a symbol of creation, mirroring their myth of the sun god Ra (or Amun-Ra) rising from the primordial waters. The temple’s location, therefore, was not accidental but a deliberate choice reflecting powerful religious beliefs about cosmic rebirth and divine emergence.Over centuries, natural river movements and deliberate human interventions shaped Karnak’s environment. The Nile carved new channels around the sacred island, while ancient engineers expanded the site by filling waterways with desert sands and sediments to make room for temple construction. This blending of geology and ingenuity turned the area into one of the grandest religious centres of the ancient world, aligning architecture with celestial and environmental symbolism.By analysing sediment layers and pottery distribution, researchers traced how the Nile’s floodplain evolved alongside Egypt’s civilisation. The findings reveal that temple construction began much earlier than previously believed, dating to the Old Kingdom period (2591–2152 BCE). These results also show how environmental change directly influenced urban planning and religious architecture, offering the first measurable evidence of how Egyptians transformed a dynamic river landscape into sacred land.The Karnak revelations come amid a surge of major finds across Egypt. Archaeologists recently unearthed three 3,000-year-old tombs near Dra Abu el-Naga, dating to the New Kingdom period. Meanwhile, underground tunnel systems at Taposiris Magna have renewed interest in Cleopatra’s final resting place, and submerged harbour sites are shedding light on Egypt’s maritime and funerary traditions. Collectively, these discoveries are reshaping our understanding of how the Nile’s shifting geography influenced Egyptian religion, burial practices, and power.The study marks a breakthrough in Egyptology, demonstrating how modern science can illuminate the hidden geological and mythological layers of ancient monuments. The discovery of the sacred island beneath Karnak reframes the temple not merely as a structure of devotion, but as a living reflection of Egypt’s relationship with the Nile and the cosmos. As excavations continue, researchers believe further secrets lie buried under Luxor’s sands, waiting to rewrite the story of Egypt’s sacred beginnings.","Karnak Temple was originally built on a natural river island more than 3,000 years ago.

Anil, a Mangalorean comedian known for his viral sketches, champions Malgudi Restaurant, which specializes in Karnataka-style dosas. For him, it’s a nostalgic experience,the crispiness, the butter, and the famed “benet dosa” he had heard about but never tried until now.

Raf and Mel, a creative couple running a fast-growing food page, support Yummy Dossa , a spot outside Karama that reimagines dosa by blending bold, almost rule-breaking Mumbai street food influences with traditional South Indian flavors. Their approach brings a lively, chaotic energy that makes their dosas unforgettable.

Shaz, a Chennai native and YouTuber with over a million subscribers, advocates for Saravanaa Bhavan—perhaps the most established name in South Indian vegetarian cuisine worldwide. For him, it’s the go-to spot when seeking authentic, no-frills dosa that stays true to tradition.

If you’ve lived in Dubai long enough, you know that debates over food can be just as passionate as those over traffic or rent. And among South Indian communities, and anyone who’s ever fallen for the irresistible crispness of a dosa, the question of who makes the best dosa is more than just idle chat, it’s about a dish steeped in tradition and regional pride, with contested origins between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.Led by one of the UAE’s most beloved storytellers, Khalid Al Ameri, known for his uplifting content and deep dives into identity, family, and food, recently set out to find the best dosa in Dubai in his recent YouTube video , armed with a camera, and rallying five Dubai-based creators to help settle the score, or at least stir it gently.“We’re on a mission to find the best dosa in the city, as ranked by all of you on social media,” he announces at the start of the video, which quickly turns into a warm, witty, and flavor-packed journey across five distinct restaurants.Khalid’s guests are not just tag-alongs, they each champion a different style of dosa, each coming from a personal, cultural, or creative place.With the lineup and itinerary in place, Khalid sets out not just to sample dosas, but to explore the stories of tradition, creativity, and nostalgia that each one carries.At Malgudi, the focus is on authentic Karnataka flavors. Anil, a comedian from Mangalore, admits this is his first visit here, despite his roots.The star of the show is the “benet dosa” — smaller and thicker than the usual, made from a rice and lentil batter. What sets it apart is the generous spread of white unsalted butter flown in from Karnataka, lending a rich creaminess that’s hard to forget.In the kitchen, the chef tests the pan’s heat with a splash of water — a simple but crucial step to get the crisp right. The batter is spread thin and cooked to a golden crisp. The dosa is filled with onions, cheese, and a dusting of pi powder, a spicy, flavorful addition. The chutneys served alongside—coconut, tomato, garlic, and a tangy secret chutney called puli in wa—complement the dish perfectly.Anil’s enthusiasm is clear; the crisp texture and buttery richness hit all the nostalgic notes. Malgudi’s dosa earns a solid 10 out of 10 for its authentic, heartfelt preparation.Yummy Dossa is where dosa gets a bold, modern twist. Established in 2017, this spot brings a creative fusion of South Indian and Mumbai street food influences, resulting in innovative, visually striking dishes.Their standout is the matka dosa, a layered, cheesy, gravy-filled creation that bursts with flavor. Khalid Al Ameri likens it to “dosa on steroids,” with its bold, layered preparation that feels less like cooking and more like painting a canvas, applying fillings directly onto the dosa to pack every bite with taste.At the end of the menu is the Nutella dosa, a sweet and indulgent take that pushes boundaries by turning the dosa into a dessert experience.Yummy Dossa scores a 10 out of 10 for its fearless creativity and execution, redefining what dosa can be without losing its soul.Here, the dosa takes on a minimalist, health-conscious approach. Vasantha Bhavan, a Dubai staple since 1997, emphasizes balance over indulgence, using minimal ghee to create a lighter, yet still flavorful, dosa.Rohit, known for his witty social media commentary, appreciates this dosa for its straightforwardness and clean flavors. The dosa is crisp but not oily, paired with well-seasoned sambar and chutneys that hit just the right notes without overpowering.Khalid calls it “the healthiest dosa I’ve ever eaten,” and it’s easy to see why. It’s not flashy, but it’s reliable, a dosa you can enjoy any day without guilt. Rohit awards it a 9.5 out of 10, valuing its elegant simplicity and thoughtful preparation.Sangeetha brings a sense of tradition and familiarity, having been a part of Dubai’s food scene since 1984. The dosa is served on banana leaves, adding an earthy, nostalgic touch. The chutney is slightly coarse, evoking homemade authenticity, while the filter coffee is sharp and refreshing.Jasmine, a creator with a fondness for classic dishes, chooses the paper roast dosa — an extra-thin, crispy sheet that crackles delightfully when torn. She likens it to a dosa she’d bring to a family gathering: understated but dependable.The dosa evokes a sense of home and comfort, despite some minor rough edges in the chutney. Jasmine rates it 8 out of 10, appreciating the genuine experience that harks back to old memories.Saravanaa Bhavan is the heavyweight of South Indian vegetarian cuisine, serving hundreds of thousands daily worldwide. For Shaz, a YouTuber and Chennai native, this dosa is deeply personal — a taste of home and tradition.The highlight is the ghee roast girros dosa, paired with classic potato-onion masala, crisp vada, and strong filter coffee. The dosa is rich but balanced, with the familiar flavors that define Chennai’s culinary heritage.For Khalid and Shaz, this dosa represents authenticity in its purest form — no gimmicks, just a straightforward, satisfying meal. They give Saravanaa Bhavan a perfect 10 out of 10 for its faithful representation of tradition.So, who wins?Khalid’s verdict is simple: everyone.Instead of crowning a single champion, he honors all five restaurants with a special recognition — because the “best” dosa isn’t one-size-fits-all. It’s about what resonates with you.Because here’s the real takeaway:The best dosa is the one that reminds you of home, or helps you make a new one. It might be slick with butter like in Malgudi, wild and sweet at Yummy Dossa, light and clean at Vasantha Bhavan, paper-thin at Sangeetha, or soulfully complete at Saravanaa Bhavan.Each version holds its place, tells a story, and leaves behind a little more than just a satisfied stomach. And that’s what Dubai does best — it turns even the most regional of traditions into something global, yet deeply personal.","The best dosa in Dubai has been voted on by five Dubai-based creators.

The arrival of an exceptionally large newborn often sparks both medical attention and public fascination. Shelby Martin, a first-time mother from Nashville, Tennessee, recently captured worldwide interest after giving birth to her son, Cassian, weighing an astounding 12 pounds, 14 ounces (5.8 kg). His birth not only set a new record at TriStar Centennial Women’s Hospital but also went viral online, with thousands reacting in disbelief and humour. Cassian’s extraordinary size highlights the natural variation in human births while underscoring the strength and resilience required of mothers during delivery. Despite the challenges associated with delivering a jumbo baby, both Shelby and her son are thriving, demonstrating the remarkable combination of maternal endurance and expert medical care that makes such births possible.Shelby Martin shared her pregnancy journey on TikTok, showcasing an unusually large baby bump. Her humour and candid commentary struck a chord, quickly amassing over 4.4 million likes and tens of thousands of comments. In the video, she quipped, “When people talk about having a big baby… trust me, I know big,” giving viewers a glimpse of the size of her unborn son before birth, while also sharing tips on coping with physical strain, cravings, and the emotional ups and downs of late-stage pregnancy.Social media users responded with disbelief and humour, with comments jokingly asking how long the baby had been inside or suggesting creative ways he might have been delivered. The viral moment highlights how extraordinary pregnancies can captivate public attention, especially when coupled with light-hearted commentary, relatability, and genuine, everyday parenting experiences that resonate widely online.As reported by The New York Post, Cassian, Shelby’s newborn son, weighed a staggering 12 pounds, 14 ounces at birth via C-section. This size is remarkable, as the average newborn in the United States weighs approximately 7 pounds, according to Stanford Children’s Health. Cassian’s birth marks the largest at TriStar Centennial Women’s Hospital in more than three years, leaving both doctors and nurses in awe of his size and overall health.Despite his impressive size, Cassian required only a brief stay in the NICU for monitoring. He received IV fluids, oxygen support, and glucose monitoring to ensure stable health in his first critical days. Doctors acted quickly to prevent complications, and Shelby expressed her gratitude to the medical team, highlighting the importance of professional care and support during complex deliveries.Babies born with exceptionally high birth weights—commonly referred to as macrosomic or “jumbo” babies—pose unique challenges during delivery. Mothers may require C-sections to safely deliver infants over 10 pounds due to increased risks of complications, such as prolonged labour, perineal tears, and shoulder dystocia. NICU monitoring for glucose levels, oxygen, and feeding is often necessary to ensure the newborn’s smooth transition after birth.These precautions underscore the importance of skilled obstetric and neonatal care, particularly in cases of extreme birth weights. Shelby’s experience demonstrates that, with proper medical support, both mother and child can thrive, even in extraordinary circumstances.Cassian is not the first oversized newborn to make national news. In Florida, Daniella Hines delivered her son Annan at 13 pounds, 15 ounces in early September, while in Alabama, Pamela Mann welcomed her daughter Paris Halo weighing 13 pounds, 4 ounces in March. These births show that, while rare, jumbo babies occur across the country, often inspiring social media fascination and local media coverage as reported.For comparison, a typical newborn weighs between 6 and 8 pounds, meaning these infants are nearly double the size of average babies. Their births offer both medical intrigue and a reminder of the wide spectrum of normal human development.Extraordinarily large babies often bring a mixture of awe, humour, and practical challenges. Families celebrate the milestone, while medical teams carefully manage delivery risks. Social media reactions—from playful jokes to expressions of amazement—highlight the fascination these births inspire globally.Babies weighing over 9 pounds, 15 ounces at birth are generally classified as macrosomic. While genetics and maternal health play key roles, factors like maternal diabetes or prolonged pregnancies can contribute to higher birth weights. Careful prenatal monitoring, preparation for potential C-section deliveries, and NICU readiness are crucial for safe outcomes.","Shelby Martin shared her pregnancy journey on TikTok, showcasing an unusually large baby bump.

Residents in several parts of the UAE are being advised to brace for rainy weather, lower temperatures, and dusty winds between Friday, October 10, and Tuesday, October 14, as a shifting weather system moves through the region, primarily affecting the northern and eastern areas.The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has forecast a period of unstable weather conditions starting Friday, October 10, through Tuesday, October 14, due to the influence of an extended surface low-pressure system from the south and an upper-level low carrying relatively cold and humid air. These upper-level low-pressure systems tend to intensify with altitude and are typically linked with cloud development and rainfall.During this five-day stretch, weather models indicate that areas most likely to experience rain include Ras Al Khaimah, Fujairah, and Al Ain, while major coastal cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi are expected to remain largely dry. The Windy app projects the rain will begin on Sunday. Forecasts describe the expected rainfall as light to moderate overall, with some areas experiencing heavy rain intermittently. This weather activity is expected to affect primarily the northern and eastern regions, with the potential to extend inland and toward some western areas.There is also a limited chance of hailstones forming in certain locations.In addition to rain, a noticeable drop in temperatures is expected across several affected regions. Windy conditions may intensify at times, potentially kicking up dust and sand. These conditions may reduce visibility in some areas and could affect outdoor plans, especially during the weekend. Sea conditions are also likely to be impacted, with wave activity in both the Arabian Gulf and the Oman Sea ranging from slight to moderate, occasionally becoming rough.September and October are typically among the most humid months of the year in the UAE, with humidity sometimes reaching 100 percent. However, this year has seen relatively drier conditions leading up to this weather shift. With forecasts predicting a cooler, wetter period, residents and travelers are advised to monitor updates and plan accordingly.","From October 10-14, Ras Al Khaimah, Fujairah, and Al Ain are expected to experience light to moderate rain and dust.

Travelling without a valid ticket / fare evasion: SAR 200 + applicable fare (inspectors can add the fine on top of the fare). Validate your ticket.



Putting feet on seats / occupying priority seats without reason: SAR 200. Courtesy rules protect seats for others.



Bringing non-foldable scooters, bikes, skateboards (not permitted): SAR 200. Pushable strollers and mobility aids are allowed.



Sleeping in prohibited areas / disturbing passengers or staff (loud phone calls, blocking doors): SAR 200. Keep noise and obstruction to a minimum.



Dangerous behaviour (sticking body out windows, hanging off exterior): SAR 300. This is classed as a safety risk.



Vandalism, tampering with equipment or unauthorized access: SAR 500 (and higher for serious damage). Deliberate damage carries much harsher penalties. Major infrastructure misuse or repeat/dangerous offences: fines scale steeply up to tens/hundreds of thousands of SAR — and repeat offenders may face penalties up to SR10 million and possible imprisonment in the most extreme cases. (These are handled under rail/transport law to protect critical infrastructure.)



How fines are enforced, paid and — if needed — appealed

Ask staff for the violation slip and keep any proof (ticket, photo, time). RPT has customer care contacts for queries.



Pay online via national portals — many government fines can be paid through Saudi platforms such as My.gov.sa / Sadad / Efaa or the specific payment method listed on the fine. (Check the violation notice for payment instructions.



/ Efaa or the specific payment method listed on the fine. (Check the violation notice for payment instructions. To contest a fine call RPT customer care (the RPT contact page lists phone and email) or follow the appeals instructions on the notice; keep evidence and timelines ready. If a fine is a traffic-style government violation it may also appear on national e-services.

What it means for daily commuters — quick, common-sense tips to stay fine-free

Always validate your Darb card or digital ticket before boarding. The ticket system is linked to fine enforcement.



Don’t eat, drink or smoke on trains. Enjoy snacks at stations or before/after journeys. SAR100–200 is easily avoidable.



Keep feet off seats and respect priority seats. It’s cheap to follow and the fine is real.



Fold or avoid bringing big wheeled devices (non-foldable scooters/bikes are not permitted). Use permitted luggage zones



If you see damage or safety hazards, report it to station staff or RPT hotlines reporting helps protect the system and may spare you liability if you were unaware.







Riyadh Public Transport has published a set of new rules and fines for users of the Riyadh Metro to keep trains clean, safe and on time.

Read on for the exact penalty list, how fines are enforced, where to pay or appeal, and simple common-sense tips to keep you fine-free.Here are the penalties commuters are likely to encounter — the short version you can memorize:Why two different ranges appear in the press: short, everyday fines (SAR100–500) are set to manage passenger behavior; a separate regulatory framework sets much larger penalties for sabotage, infrastructure damage or repeat, serious offences.Riyadh Public Transport (RPT) enforces the rules using station staff, onboard inspectors and CCTV; fines may be issued on the spot or registered via the system and tied to your ticket or card. For commuters this means: validate your ticket, follow signage, and keep a receipt if you are issued a notice.If you do get a notice:Riyadh’s new rules mostly target nuisance behavior and real safety threats. For the average rider a few small habits prevent trouble:For everyday Riyadh riders the message is simple: these fines are designed to keep rides clean and safe most penalties are small but enforceable. The expensive, high-end penalties are aimed at protecting transport infrastructure and public safety, don’t test those.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

"OpenAI’s startup boss to European companies: Americans are ""almost shameless"" when ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openais-startup-boss-to-european-companies-americans-are-almost-shameless-when-/articleshow/124483958.cms,"FILE - (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File)





American startup founders are “almost shameless” in their assertive demands and feedback to AI giant OpenAI , according to Laura Modiano, head of OpenAI’s startups division in EMEA. Speaking at the Sifted Summit this week, Modiano highlighted a stark contrast between U.S. and European entrepreneurs, urging the latter to be more vocal to seize opportunities in the fast-evolving AI landscape. Drawing from her experience working with founders across both regions, Modiano praised American entrepreneurs for their directness.“They come in and say, ‘We need this. You need to improve that,’” she said during a fireside chat. “If founders don’t tell us, we don’t always know.” She encouraged European founders to adopt a similar approach, warning that silence could mean missing out on shaping AI advancements. Modiano pointed to Swedish startup Lovable, valued at $1.8 billion, as a model for effective feedback. The vibe-coding company, which launched its GPT-5-based Lovable Assistant 5 alongside OpenAI’s latest model, provided intensive input during early access. “I was in their office for a week, and every hour we were having reviews,” Modiano recounted, noting that European developers’ feedback directly influenced GPT-5’s development.Another success story is Sana, a Swedish AI-learning platform. Modiano recalled visiting their office, where founders demanded specific voice capabilities, such as tone and speed adjustments. This feedback was cross-referenced with similar requests, leading OpenAI to prioritize those features on its roadmap. “We can only ship what customers tell us they want,” Modiano emphasized, suggesting startups appoint a “chief feedback officer” to ensure their needs are heard.Her comments fuel an ongoing debate about the cultural differences between U.S. and European entrepreneurs. Earlier this year, venture capitalists criticized European founders for lacking the intensity of their American counterparts, with some urging them to adopt a seven-day workweek to compete globally.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has once again turned his fire on ChatGPT-maker OpenAI , accusing the company of betraying its founding mission and exploiting its non-profit status to profit. In a scathing post on X, the world’s richest man writes: “OpenAI is built on a lie”, adding “They stole a charity and used it for their own financial gain”. Musk was replying to a post by an X user named Helen Toner who shared:“Every so often, OpenAI employees ask me how I see the co now.It's always tough to give a simple answer. Some things they're doing, eg on CoT monitoring or building out system cards, are great.But the dishonesty & intimidation tactics in their policy work are really not. E.g:”Elon Musk’s sharp remarks against OpenAI comes as multiple users on X reported to have received subpoena from OpenAI in Elon Musk's lawsuit against the company, demanding all documents related to its governance and investors, served at his Oklahoma home shortly after organizing an open letter on AI transparency.In another post, Musk accused the company of using “dirty tricks” to intimidate AI policy advocates, specifically referencing a sheriff's deputy serving a personal subpoena to nonprofit lawyer Nathan Calvin amid California's SB 53 debates.The incident ties into OpenAI's lawsuit against Elon Musk, where subpoenas sought evidence of his funding critics like Calvin's group Encode, though no such links exist, escalating public scrutiny on AI corporate tactics.Notably, this is not the first time that Elon Musk has criticized OpenAI. Musk has publicly labelled OpenAI CEO as ‘SCAM Altman’. He has consistently argued that this shift compromises OpenAI's original mission, turning it into a ""closed-source de facto subsidiary"" of Microsoft and prioritizing profit over public good. He has even filed lawsuits against OpenAI, alleging breach of contract and that the company has strayed from its initial non-profit commitment.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has once again turned his fire on ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.

""We are probably the world's most active users of Slack internally at OpenAI and I think they're going to be really enduring and important systems for a while.”

“We use kind of all the canonical SaaS systems you can think of. These are really important systems for OpenAI, and I think they're going to be really enduring and important systems for a while,”

How AI will improve among Slack and other traditional tools



“live in the cracks”

“But one of the things that we're able to do is actually use AI systems to basically help live in the cracks between, kind of what the user needs to be able to do with those systems, and kind of what those systems represent in terms of a workflow. So if you're a salesperson, for example, and you're trying to prepare for a meeting, right, there are a lot of factors that aggregate into how you think about preparation for that client and that customer.

Historically, you've had to go collect all those yourself. You've had to synthesise all the takeaways. You've had to kind of run the analysis, pull the data to write the profile, and hand that off to the other person who needs the context. All that now can be condensed, and so we built a lot of tooling around that for us to be able to actually make our sales teams much more productive and much more efficient and so and we hold everyone to that bar.

So the way we kind of look at this is there's a team whose job it is to think about how to actually drive output, drive impact in our organisation, so that when we have a salesperson join the team, or a marketer or a software engineer or whoever it is, they really are starting at a higher baseline level of productivity, and they can start to think more along the lines of, ‘hey, you know, instead of managing five or 10 accounts, maybe you can manage 20 accounts, Right? And that's just incredible leverage in our business.”
