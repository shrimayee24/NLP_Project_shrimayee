With the UAE‚Äôs rapid digital transformation fueling record smartphone and app usage, the nation‚Äôs top cybersecurity body has sounded the alarm on the dangers of unverified applications. In a warning underscored by recent spikes in cyber attacks, the UAE Cybersecurity Council called on the public to adopt strict mobile safety habits, as part of an all-out effort to bolster cyber protection across the Emirates The warning arrives at a critical juncture. In 2025, daily cyber attacks in the UAE have approached 200,000, according to government estimates, impacting public and private sectors as well as individual users.Cyber criminals have increasingly leveraged malicious apps to distribute malware, steal financial data, commit identity theft, and access sensitive personal information, a risk heightened during national events, holidays, and times of increased online activity.Key Elements of the Council‚Äôs Guidance:The Council stresses the necessity of using the official Apple App Store, Google Play, or equivalent trusted sources.Third-party or unofficial app stores common sources of malware and should be avoided completely.Users are urged to carefully review what permissions an app requests during installation. Excessive access to contacts, messages, camera, or location, beyond what is required for the app‚Äôs function can be a red flag for spyware or fraud.The Council highlights that keeping your operating system and apps updated with the latest security patches is essential, as vulnerabilities are regularly exploited by cybercriminals.Phishing remains a popular attack vector; users are told to avoid tapping on links or downloading files sent from unknown or suspicious sources, whether via text, emails, or messaging apps.These warnings are being reinforced through ongoing public campaigns, including the ""Cyber Pulse"" initiative, aimed at increasing awareness and teaching practical steps for online self-defence.Reports show a 63% year-over-year rise in detected mobile app vulnerabilities in the Emirates, with finance, healthcare, and logistics sectors most at risk.Federal laws such as the UAE Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL) and the National Electronic Security Authority (NESA) regulations require businesses to ensure digital safety, perform regular audits, and report breaches. Non-compliance can result in steep penalties.The Central Bank of the UAE has mandated a transition from less secure authentication (e.g., SMS/email OTPs), pushing for more secure, app-based verification to further reduce common fraud risks.As part of its Vision 2030 and National Cybersecurity Strategy, the UAE government is investing in:Multi-tiered strategies including public education, regulatory updates, and enhanced sector-specific protections.Establishing Security Operations Centres (SOCs) across government and critical infrastructure to detect and neutralize cyber threats in real-time.Ongoing training, audits, and collaborative drills are now routine for government employees, businesses, and the public, aiming to make robust cybersecurity second nature.The UAE‚Äôs warning about unverified apps isn‚Äôt a mere caution, it‚Äôs a direct response to the evolving sophistication of cyberthreats targeting a digitally connected population. By following the cybersecurity best practices outlined above and relying solely on verified sources, citizens and businesses can significantly reduce their vulnerability. The Council‚Äôs latest alert, grounded in real-time threat data and enforced through ongoing public education, marks another step in the country‚Äôs determined campaign to make the UAE a global model for safe, resilient, and trusted digital living.","The UAE Cybersecurity Council has issued a nation-wide warning urging residents to avoid downloading unverified mobile applications.

The legendary paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren's home and museum in Monroe, Connecticut, which houses the notorious Annabelle doll, has been acquired by American comedian Matt Rife and his friend Elton Castee. A number of paranormal phenomena have been connected to the doll, a purportedly haunted antique, since the 1970s.Sharing a video on TikTok, he said, ""Ed and Lorraine Warren are who took demonology, ghost hunting, and paranormal investigation and made it mainstream. Now, I know a lot of you don't know what any of this means whatsoever, but if you follow ghost stuff, this is about as big as it gets.""Rife expressed his interest in buying the museum and the doll in his post, saying that he is ""obsessed"" with the paranormal and everything haunted, particularly ""The Conjuring"" series. ""This is the most random hobby ever, but it's so (expletive) cool,"" he grinned.The popularity of the Conjuring series, which brought viewers back to a scary haunting artifact‚Äîthe Annabelle doll‚Äîbrought Warren's back into the spotlight. For at least the next five years, Rife and Castee will both serve as the ""legal guardians"" of the doll and the rest of the haunting collection.The 2,544-square-foot home they purchased has four bedrooms, two bathrooms, and an estimated value of $627,600. The property's precise purchasing price is not made public.""We plan to open the house for overnight stays and museum tours so you yourself can experience and learn all the haunted history surrounding this amazing place,"" they wrote on their Instagram account.","Comedian Matt Rife and his friend Elton Castee have bought Ed and Lorraine Warren's home and museum in Monroe, Connecticut.

The Post-Woke Celebrity Archetype



Ambiguity over affirmation

Presence over preaching

Why MAGA Can‚Äôt Stop Posting Her



She‚Äôs young. The GOP‚Äôs problem has always been youth appeal. Sydney solves that.

She‚Äôs beautiful. Liberal feminists would call that ‚Äúproblematic.‚Äù The Right calls it reality.

She‚Äôs talented. Awards, praise, and prestige roles, all without being preachy.

She‚Äôs silent. No need to cancel. No need to apologise. No moral panic. Just vibes.

The Mirror, Not the Mouthpiece







In the first of the Republican National Conservative debates, when Trump steadfastly refused to participate to show Fox who was the man, then-presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy summed up the inflection point that was about to overshadow America: ‚ÄúYou want to be a rebel? You want to be a hippie? You want to ‚Äòstick it to the man‚Äô? Show up on your college campus and try calling yourself a conservative. ‚ÄùIt‚Äôs true. Being liberal used to be an act of rebellion. But that rebellion became mainstream, corporatised, and institutionalised. It now lives on as HR slideshows, Twitter mobs, and avocado ad campaigns. Being young and Republican in 2025 is an act of defiance. And today‚Äôs protestants become tomorrow‚Äôs mainstream‚Äîevidenced by the fact that there are now more young people who identify as Republican than Democrat in America.It‚Äôs not clear when the Left lost the youth. Perhaps it was the cascade of madness: the woke craze of pushing trans behaviour in grammar schools. Demanding biological males be allowed to play in women‚Äôs sports. Saying illegal immigrants should have unfettered access to welfare. Shouting ‚ÄúDefund the Police‚Äù while shoplifting turned into organised retail looting. Declaring obesity a form of body positivity. Telling working-class white kids that their skin colour was an inherited sin.Declaring that whiteness ought to be apologised for.Slowly, the country shifted. Not by campaign ads or policy briefings‚Äîbut by exhaustion. And as America began tuning out the moral lectures from elites, late-night comedians, and Hollywood, a new icon quietly emerged. Not a pundit. Not a senator. Not a firebrand. A muse.In an era where even a sneeze can be interpreted as a political statement, Sydney Sweeney has become the conservative darling of the year‚Äîwithout attending a single rally or issuing a single press release. The star of Euphoria and The White Lotus has, quite by accident, become a MAGA icon. All it took was a leaked Republican voter registration, a denim ad campaign misread as a white supremacist dog whistle, and a shooting range video that could‚Äôve doubled as NRA propaganda. Welcome to 2025, where political identity is crafted less by what you say, and more by which side claims you.It recently emerged that Sydney Sweeney is registered as a Republican in Florida. That was it.She didn‚Äôt make a political speech. She didn‚Äôt wear a MAGA hat. She didn‚Äôt retweet Ben Shapiro. All she did was file the correct paperwork, and the internet found it. Her name. Her address. Her party.Suddenly, the Right had its new pin-up girl. The Left had a meltdown.For conservatives, this was a cultural coup. A beautiful, talented Hollywood starlet‚Äîyoung, blonde, wildly popular‚Äîwas officially red. Not pink. Not centrist. Red. And best of all? She wasn‚Äôt saying sorry for it.The silence was glorious. No apology tour. No clarifying tweet. No ‚ÄúI was hacked‚Äù statement. Liberals demanded answers. Progressives called it a betrayal. But Sydney Sweeney didn‚Äôt flinch. And in an age where even Instagram captions are pored over for political subtext, saying nothing is a weapon.‚ÄúGreat Jeans‚Äù and the Eugenics Panic of Summer 2025Then came the American Eagle campaign.Sydney Sweeney, in tight denim and a tank top, staring into the camera under the caption: ‚ÄúGreat Genes.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the ad.Within hours, the internet exploded. Not because of the fashion. Not because of the cut. But because of the word: ‚Äúgenes.‚Äù Not jeans. Genes.The Left read it as a eugenics dog whistle. A blonde-haired, blue-eyed woman fronting a brand with a tagline that sounded suspiciously like white supremacy.Satirical Twitter lit up: ‚ÄúThis is Leni Riefenstahl for Gen Z.‚Äù ‚ÄúAre they selling pants or the master race?‚ÄùBut the Right? The Right cackled. This was proof. Proof that the outrage industry had gone too far. That even a pun could be labelled fascist. That Sydney Sweeney, just by existing in her natural body and not issuing trigger warnings, was now enemy number one.American Eagle didn‚Äôt back down. Sales spiked. The controversy became the campaign. Sydney didn‚Äôt write the tagline. She was just the face. But once again, the narrative moved around her. She became the accidental symbol of conservative resistance to liberal hysteria.And then the final seal was pressed: the shooting range video.Sydney, in casualwear and earmuffs, loading a Glock like she was born in Fort Benning. First-time shooter? Didn‚Äôt look like it. Her stance, her focus, her shot grouping‚Äîit was enough to make half of Republican Twitter swoon.Clips went viral:The symbolism was perfect. A young woman in Hollywood, not just pretending to shoot in a Netflix movie‚Äîbut actually firing rounds at a paper target, calmly, confidently. No virtue signalling. No trembling hands. Just recoil and resolve.The Right didn't need words. The imagery was enough. Mainstream Republicans quickly rallied behind Sydney Sweeney. Vice President JD Vance criticised Democrats for ‚Äúcalling everyone who thinks Sydney Sweeney beautiful a Nazi,‚Äù saying it showed how out of touch the party had become with young voters. Senator Ted Cruz also weighed in, posting on X: ‚ÄúWow. Now the crazy Left has come out against beautiful women. I‚Äôm sure that will poll well. ‚Äù Inside the White House, officials saw the controversy as a win, saying it helped highlight what they view as liberal overreach and cultural policing. For many Republicans, Sweeney‚Äôs party registration wasn‚Äôt just a detail‚Äîit was confirmation that the culture war was breaking their way.What makes Sydney Sweeney such a potent figure is precisely her ambiguity.She doesn‚Äôt tweet about taxes. She doesn‚Äôt complain about feminism. She doesn‚Äôt post ‚ÄúI Voted‚Äù stickers or abortion fundraisers. She doesn‚Äôt do red carpet activism. And in 2025, that absence speaks louder than any hashtag.Hollywood thrives on performative wokeness. Stars compete to signal their virtue‚Äîwhether it's climate guilt on private jets or apologies for being cast as straight characters. Sydney Sweeney has opted out.That, to a large chunk of America, makes her radical. Because silence is now seen as alignment. Refusing to bend the knee is tantamount to opposition. And that‚Äôs why both sides are fighting to frame her.To liberals, she‚Äôs naive at best, complicit at worst. To conservatives, she‚Äôs a unicorn: the apolitical star who still represents everything they believe in‚Äîbeauty, freedom, guns, and denim.What Sydney Sweeney represents is something new: the post-woke Hollywood icon. Not a right-wing activist. Not a left-wing darling. But someone who has managed to float above the trench warfare.This new archetype is defined by:She‚Äôs not talking about CRT, climate change, or colonialism. She‚Äôs talking about her dog. Or her workout. Or her skincare routine. And yet, her silence makes her subversive.She isn‚Äôt against the Left in any direct sense. She‚Äôs just not of it. And that distinction matters.There‚Äôs a reason conservative media can‚Äôt get enough of her:In other words, she‚Äôs the anti-Lena Dunham. The anti-Alyssa Milano. The anti-everything that drove red-state Americans away from Hollywood.The Culture War‚Äôs Most Valuable PawnSydney Sweeney didn‚Äôt ask to be drafted into the culture war. She just voted. Then modelled. Then fired a gun.But in the content economy, you don‚Äôt get to choose how you're used. She became a screen onto which America projected its anxieties and aspirations. And the fact that she never pushed back made her more powerful.The Right turned her into a meme. The Left turned her into a warning. And Sydney? Sydney went back to work. To movies. To photo shoots. To her life.That may be the most radical thing of all.Sydney Sweeney is not giving speeches. She‚Äôs not asking for your vote. She‚Äôs not applying to be the next Kayleigh McEnany.She is simply existing. But in 2025, that‚Äôs all it takes.She is a mirror‚Äîreflecting everything America wants to believe, or fears to acknowledge. To the Right, she‚Äôs the proof that Hollywood doesn‚Äôt own the narrative. To the Left, she‚Äôs a reminder that silence can be resistance too.And in a country where every movie, every tweet, every ad campaign becomes a battleground, Sydney Sweeney has done the unthinkable.She said nothing. And everyone heard it.","In an era where even a sneeze can be interpreted as a political statement, Sydney Sweeney has become the conservative darling of the year. All it took was a leaked Republican voter registration, a denim ad campaign misread as a white supremacist dog whistle, and a shooting range video.

GUNTUR: Charvi Potluri, a dedicated disciple of Acharya Smt. Ramya Shankaran, took center stage to present her Bharatanatyam arangetram, a significant milestone in her journey as a classical dancer, here on Sunday.A student of the Adhyaathma School of Performing Arts in New Jersey, Charvi has honed her skills under the expert guidance of Acharya Smt. Ramya Shankaran, a revered figure in the world of Bharatanatyam.The event was a breathtaking showcase of elegance, precision, and heartfelt devotion, captivating the audience with Charvi‚Äôs artistry and her deep connection to the spiritual essence of Bharatanatyam. From the opening notes of the vibrant ‚ÄúPushpanjali‚Äù to the exhilarating finale of the ‚ÄúThillana‚Äù, Charvi‚Äôs performance was a testament to her years of rigorous training, unwavering commitment, and profound love for the art form.Charvi‚Äôs Arangetram was a meticulously curated presentation of Bharatanatyam‚Äôs traditional repertoire, infused with creativity and emotional depth. Her performance began with the ‚ÄúPushpanjali‚Äù, a floral offering to the divine and the audience, which set the tone for the evening with its vibrant energy and graceful movements. Charvi‚Äôs precise footwork and expressive gestures immediately drew the audience into her world, establishing her command over the intricate rhythms of Bharatanatyam.One of the standout pieces of the evening was the ‚ÄúDasavatara Alaripu‚Äù, a creatively reimagined rendition of the traditional ‚ÄúAlaripu‚Äù. This piece, which depicted the ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu, was a brilliant fusion of innovation and tradition. Charvi‚Äôs ability to convey the distinct characteristics of each avatar through subtle ‚Äúabhinaya‚Äù (expressive storytelling) and dynamic ‚Äúnritya‚Äù (pure dance) showcased her versatility and deep understanding of the narrative potential of Bharatanatyam. The audience was particularly moved by her portrayal of Lord Rama and Lord Krishna, where her expressive eyes and fluid movements brought the divine stories to life.The centerpiece of the recital was the ‚ÄúChellamela Varnam‚Äù, a soulful and intricate composition that tested Charvi‚Äôs technical prowess and emotional range. The ‚ÄúVarnam‚Äù, known for its demanding combination of complex footwork, rhythmic patterns, and expressive storytelling, was performed with remarkable maturity. Charvi‚Äôs ability to seamlessly transition between the energetic rhythmic sequences and the emotive ‚Äòabhinaya‚Äô segments highlighted her skill and sensitivity as a performer. Her portrayal of the nayika‚Äôs (heroine‚Äôs) devotion and longing resonated deeply with the audience, evoking a sense of spiritual connection.Charvi‚Äôs performance was infused with infectious energy and joy, as she brought to life the playful and divine attributes of Krishna through her expressive gestures and vibrant stage presence. This piece, in particular, showcased her ability to connect with the audience, drawing them into the divine narrative with her infectious enthusiasm and grace.The recital concluded with a lively ‚ÄúThillana‚Äù, a pure dance piece known for its intricate footwork and rhythmic complexity. Charvi‚Äôs performance was a dazzling display of energy and precision, leaving the audience in awe of her stamina and command over the art form.Complementing Charvi‚Äôs stellar performance was the live orchestra led by the talented Vid. Pavan Madhav Masur. The ensemble‚Äôs soulful renditions and rhythmic precision elevated the recital to new heights. Vid. Ramya Shankaran, Charvi‚Äôs guru, provided masterful ‚Äúnattuvangam‚Äù (rhythmic recitation and cymbal accompaniment), guiding the performance with her expertise and ensuring perfect synchronization between the dancer and the musicians.The orchestra, which included vocalists, mridangam, violin, and flute, created a rich tapestry of sound that enhanced the emotional and aesthetic impact of each piece. Their melodic depth and dynamic energy were integral to the success of the evening, providing Charvi with a vibrant musical foundation to showcase her artistry.Charvi‚Äôs Arangetram was not merely a performance but a culmination of years of dedication, discipline, and passion for the classical arts. Charvi‚Äôs ability to balance her rigorous dance training with her academic pursuits and her commitment to long-distance running speaks volumes about her determination and time-management skills.This multifaceted approach to life has shaped her into a well-rounded individual, and her Arangetram was a reflection of her ability to channel her diverse interests into a singular, powerful artistic expression.Charvi Potluri‚Äôs Arangetram was more than a debut; it was a celebration of her journey as a dancer and a glimpse into her promising future in the world of Bharatanatyam. Her performance was marked by a rare combination of technical excellence, emotional depth, and stage presence, qualities that set her apart as a rising star in the classical arts. The audience, which included family, friends, and connoisseurs of Bharatanatyam, was left spellbound by her artistry and inspired by her devotion to the art form.","Charvi Potluri, a disciple of Acharya Smt.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here‚Äôs a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Read Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates' complete LinkedIn post here



I‚Äôve entered the startup world again‚Ä¶

When your daughter asks if you‚Äôd be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes.

I‚Äôve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible. But I‚Äôve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and it‚Äôs the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder Sophia Kianni.

They‚Äôve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

It‚Äôs been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.

And now, I‚Äôll be doing the same.

Looking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I won‚Äôt break anything (no promises).

Bill Gates daughter shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother



Big Question Answered: Why Google is Merging Android and ChromeOS

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, recently demonstrated a unique approach to leadership and family support by working a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup. In a LinkedIn post Bill Gates revealed that his daughter Phoebe Gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her AI-powered fashion startup ‚Äî Phoebe and Gates agreed to it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve entered the startup world again‚Ä¶ When your daughter asks if you‚Äôd be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes,‚Äù wrote Gates in a LinkedIn post.Phoebe Gates co-founded Phia along with her Stanford roommate Sophia Kianni. The platform uses AI to help users compare prices of new and second-hand products across more than 40,000 websites. A web browser/app, Phia aims to be the Booking.com of fashion, offering an instant price comparison from thousands of e-commerce sites for any item, new or used. Phoebe Gates is the youngest child of Bill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates joined the customer service team of Phia for one day in order to understand how the product works.Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates revealed that this experience reminded him that ‚Äúthe best way to understand how something works‚Äîor where it breaks‚Äîis to go straight to the people using it.‚Äù His stint echoes a growing trend among tech CEOs to spend time on the front lines, following examples like Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who famously delivered food and drove passengers to better grasp user pain points.Earlier, in April this year, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates shared that he intentionally chose not to invest in his daughter‚Äôs AI-powered shopping app, Phia, during a podcast. He explained that funding the venture would have led him to oversee it too closely. Instead, he offered advice on staffing while others handled the investment. ""In an interview published by the New York Times, soon after Phia‚Äôs web browser and app went live, Bill Gates said: ‚ÄúI thought, ‚ÄòOh boy, she‚Äôs going to come and ask.‚Äù‚ÄúI would have kept her on a short leash and be doing business reviews, which I would have found tricky,‚Äù the businessman explained of his hesitance. ‚ÄúAnd I probably would have been overly nice but wondered if it was the right thing to do.‚ÄùPhoebe Gates recently shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother, Melinda French Gates, about tackling investors. The 22-year-old co-founder of fashion pricing startup Phia got this advice from her mother after she faced queries from potential investors about her future motherhood. While raising funds for Phia with co-founder Sophia Kianni, Gates was asked what would happen if they decided to have children. On the Call Her Daddy podcast, Phoebe shared that this line of questioning prompted a call to her mother. She noted that her mother‚Äôs reply was: ""Get up or get out of the game, sis.""According to a report by Benzinga, both founders said that these inquiries expose a persistent bias in venture capital. ‚ÄúAlways children,‚Äù Melinda Gates said when asked to name the most common bias they‚Äôve faced. Kianni said she turned the tables on a male investor by asking: ""What's going to happen to your venture firm when you have kids?""""He's like, ‚ÄòWhy would that affect anything?' And I was like, ‚ÄòYou answered your own question,'‚Äù she added.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates worked a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup, Phia.

Aino does not do Moon Wheel; however, being the head of the Clink-Clank Krumkake Craftshop and with her constellation called Cistellula Mira, she is very much a character driven by invention and puzzle-solving. Aino will be free-to-play, possibly to help players unlock key mechanics in Nod-Krai.

Lunar Reactions : A New Elemental Layer



As the flames of Natlan begin to lower, HoYoverse now sets its eyes on the icy silence of Nod-Krai, being the next great region of Genshin Impact in Version 6.0. Datamines and official drip marketing have hinted at the narrative culminating, so Version 6.0 is not really just a period of new banners and a new land-it is the prelude leading to the confrontation with the Tsaritsa, and maybe the beginning of the finale for the Traveler's journey.Nod-Krai is thus described as a melting pot for every nation in Teyvat, as the scenery and theme of this place propose it as a crossroads. This is not merely a background for new mechanics-anywhere scattered threads from the Traveler's adventures may begin to interweave. References from other regions, characters, and unfinished stories are reasonably assumed to appear and place the motif of the setting both strange and yet familiar.Three new characters take the stage:The Event Banners for Version 6.0 are to feature:The first two, Flins and Lauma, are a product of the debut, while Yelan and Nahida see a feeling of intention during their reruns. Yelan received a premium outfit recently in 5.8, while Nahida, being Dendro Archon, is way overdue for another appearance. The conjecture goes that the order will perhaps be Flins and Yelan first, followed by Lauma and Nahida‚Äîbut HoYoverse has said nothing yet.Nod-Krai also introduces new gameplay: the Lunar Reactions, a mechanic tied to Hydro Reactions. In 6.0, the Lunar-Charged and Lunar-Bloom Reactions would be out for trials and experiments, further amplifying the existing combat-principle work. Limited types of these new reactions will be live at launch, while these put the spotlight toward a deeper evolving system that could actually shift elemental synergies.With 6.0, Genshin not only grows outward in map size but also sharpens its narrative edge. The arrival of Nod-Krai feels like a deliberate tightening of arcs as HoYoverse prepares the players for some more climactic confrontations. Whether it be the cryptic past of Flins, Aino's gadgets, or the promise of Lunar-powered combat, Version 6.0 is an opportunity not just for discovery but for resolution itself.","Nod-Krai also introduces new gameplay: the Lunar Reactions, a mechanic tied to Hydro Reactions.

So, make sure to monitor the family health quite closely through the Relationships tab.Suppose the starting family doesn‚Äôt fit, it's better to reroll till you are able to get the right setup. Check the Relationships tab early on to confirm who is in life. Without key figures, completing the challenge is impossible.As part of the second step, with the character turning 18, go to full-time job listings and search for a painter‚Äôs role. It is marked with an emoji of a paint palette. The role doesn‚Äôt need any degree, but an art background will definitely help. If the job does not appear, just close it and then reopen the app or try to age it up a year before you check again.A painter‚Äôs job usually pays decent money. It helps with the next step, which is to buy a turtle (Francois). As this is a low-cost pet, just a few years of work would be able to cover it. Just make sure to keep grinding until you land the Painter‚Äôs role, and that‚Äôs it. You are set. Also, once you have enough money, visit the Pet Store‚Äîpresent under the Activities tab to get your new pet. With this BitLife painter job guide, you will be able to complete the challenge with ease.This challenge tests your mettle with the fraught family objectives. To provoke an argument with a father is not always intuitive. So, instead of choosing random chats, weaponize gift giving. For it, head to profiles in the Relationships tab and present your father with something he truly dislikes‚Äîlike dead flowers, coal or some bizarre stuff. Make sure to repeat the process. It will trigger a heated confrontation between you and your father in-game, which is essential here. Just argue back as soon as he snaps.The final and somber task to complete this challenge will be to mourn the passing of your brother. While patience is a route, you can even age up repeatedly and hope that nature will take the course via accident, illness or old age. For those who seek darker and swifter conclusions, more direct methods exist.Using the Assassin‚Äôs Blade item will guarantee you no messy consequences. If not, take matters into your hands and risk a police intervention. Delay the mourning till you have potential jail time. Remember, patience is the key here. There are some steps that need it. So, do not rush. Keep an eye out for the family‚Äôs health and job listings, too. As soon as all tasks are completed, you will be able to unlock the BitLife mystery prize box. Enjoy it.","Paint it Black, the latest challenge of BitLife, is one of the sneaky challenges that looks easier but demands careful planning.

And now a new leak has surfaced online which might have revealed the system specifications of PS6 and the rumored handheld console.In a video by popular tech YouTuber and industry insider Moore Law Is Dead, the potential specs of both the consoles have been thoroughly researched. This video is based on some leaked old AMD documentations, which might have revealed a lot about the upcoming two consoles.According to this leak, the base model of PS6, codenamed ‚ÄúOrion‚Äù, is going to stick with AMD for its processor. This console is going to feature 40 to 48 RDNA 5 compute units, which can boost to 3 gigahertz and beyond. The leak also suggested that Sony is going to prioritize power efficiency, even lower than PS5 and will put heavy emphasis on cost constraints.The AMD CPU in the console is going to have 8 Zen 6 (or even later) cores along with a GPU memory architecture of 160-bit or 192-bit with Graphics Double Data Rate 7 SDRAM. Not only that, the Rasterisation Performance of the PS6 (the ability of a GPU to convert 3D geometric data into pixels on the screen) is expected to be 3 times superior to the PS5.Now coming to the rumored handheld console, according to the YouTuber, this device is codenamed as ‚ÄúCanis.‚Äù and is going to be a handheld variant of the PS6. The most exciting feature of this handheld device is its backwards compatibility to PS5 and PS4 generations.
