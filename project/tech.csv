HAMMER precision-guided bomb

Loitering munitions

NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday launched Operation Sindoor , targeting terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). The operation destroyed multiple Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) training facilities.Carried out in retaliation for the Pahalgam terrorist attack that killed 26 civilians on April 22, the mission was ""focused, measured, and non-escalatory in nature.""The Indian forces specifically targeted key JeM and LeT bases involved in orchestrating terror attacks within India. A total of nine sites were hit, including Jaish-e-Mohammed’s base in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba’s hub in Muridke.Using advanced precision weaponry and real-time intelligence, the Army, Navy, and Air Force conducted the strikes in coordination, avoiding any engagement with Pakistani military installations.India employed a range of high-precision, long-range strike weapons during the operation, including the SCALP cruise missile , the HAMMER precision-guided bomb , and loitering munitions.SCALP, also known as Storm Shadow, is a long-range, air-launched cruise missile designed for precision deep strikes against high-value, fixed targets. Manufactured by the European defence firm MBDA, the missile is conventionally armed and primarily used to destroy fortified bunkers and critical infrastructure.Weighing approximately 1,300 kilograms (2,870 pounds), SCALP is typically deployed from advanced fighter jets like the Rafale. Its integration into the Indian Air Force arsenal enables stealth operations deep within enemy territory, particularly for pre-planned missions targeting strategic assets.Beyond India, SCALP has seen combat use in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, and was also supplied to Ukraine, where its long range significantly enhanced the country's capability to strike deep behind Russian lines.HAMMER, short for Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range, is an air-to-ground precision-guided missile system developed by Safran Electronics & Defense, a French defense firm. Designed for medium-range tactical missions, HAMMER delivers high-accuracy strikes against both stationary and mobile targets.Its standout feature is a modular design, allowing it to be fitted with various guidance systems—including GPS, infrared imaging, and laser targeting. This versatility makes it effective against a broad spectrum of targets, from fortified positions to moving assets on the battlefield.Loitering munitions, often called ""kamikaze drones,"" are used for surveillance, target identification, and executing precision strikes. They loiter over potential targets and can engage threats either autonomously or under remote human control.During Operation Sindoor, the Indian Air Force deployed HAMMER missiles to engage targets requiring precision and flexibility, such as medium-range sites and potentially mobile assets linked to terror groups in the region. HAMMER’s adaptable guidance systems allowed the IAF to strike locations where dynamic targeting was essential.Its use complemented the SCALP missile, which is optimised for long-range strikes on fixed targets. Together, the deployment of HAMMER and SCALP enabled the IAF to carry out deep, precise attacks inside Pakistani territory, neutralising terror infrastructure without involving ground troops.","India on Wednesday launched Operation Sindoor, targeting terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

What happens to existing users?



Chats & Contacts: Users can log into Microsoft Teams with their Skype credentials, ensuring a seamless transition with all previous messages and contacts intact.

Paid Services: New purchases of Skype Credit and subscriptions have been halted, but existing users can continue using their plans until their billing cycle ends.

Skype Numbers: These will remain active until expiry and can be ported to other carriers. Calls to Skype Numbers will still be received via Teams

How to get started with Teams for free

Download Teams on your device from the official Microsoft Teams website. Log in with your Skype credentials. Start using Teams with all your Skype chats and contacts ready to go.





Skype is now part of a series of Microsoft projects that have not met expectations, alongside Internet Explorer and Windows Phone. Other tech companies have also faced challenges with online communication tools, with Google making several attempts through apps like Hangouts and Duo.



When Microsoft acquired Skype in 2011 for $8.5 billion, outbidding Google and Facebook, the service had around 150 million monthly users. By 2020, that number had declined to roughly 23 million, even with a brief increase during the pandemic.



Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that it will shut down its Skype video conferencing service today (May 5). “In order to streamline our free consumer communications offerings so we can more easily adapt to customer needs, we will be retiring Skype in May 2025 to focus on Microsoft Teams (free), our modern communications and collaboration hub,” said Microsoft in a blog post. The company is encouraging both free and paid Skype users to migrate to the Teams platform, which offers similar communication and collaboration features. Notably, this change does not affect Skype for Business users . Microsoft has also allowed the Skype users to sign into Teams on any supported device using their Skype credentials.Microsoft launched Skype on 2003 for easier online communication. However, with the platform lost its relevance with rise of new platforms such as Zoom, Google Meet and more. Microsoft’s decision to retire Skype is part of a broader strategy to streamline its communication services and focus on Teams, which offers enhanced collaboration tools for both personal and professional use.Microsoft has already stopped allowing new purchases of Skype Subscriptions, Skype Numbers, and Skype Credit, signaling the gradual phasing out of the platform.Moving to Teams is simple and doesn’t prevent you from also continuing to use Skype during the transition period.Here’s how to get started:","Microsoft announced it will shut down its Skype video conferencing service today.

"Titanic survivor’s haunting letter written days before sinking sells for record £300,000 at auction; here’s what it said",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/titanic-survivors-haunting-letter-sells-for-record-300000-at-auction/articleshow/120680669.cms,"A rare letter penned by Colonel Archibald Gracie , one of the Titanic’s most distinguished survivors, has fetched a record £300,000, a fivefold increase on its estimated price, at an auction in Wiltshire, as a new high price for Titanic correspondence was smashed.The letter, dated April 10, 1912, the very day Gracie boarded the Titanic, offers a chilling glimpse into the final days before disaster struck. Written on a Titanic letter card and postmarked in Queenstown and London, it is ominous in tone, with the following ominous words: ""It is a fine ship but I shall await my journey's end before I pass judgment on her.""Auctioneer Henry Aldridge and Son described it as ""a truly exceptional, museum-grade piece,"" saying it is the record price for a Titanic letter. Survivor letters of Gracie's stature are extremely rare, with this one never previously on the market.The four-page letter, written to a family acquaintance who befriended Gracie at the London Waldorf Hotel, is warm in its reminiscence about his earlier crossings on the Oceanic, remembering, ""Her sea-worthy qualities and yacht-like appearance make me miss her,"" while also marveling at the size of the Titanic.Days later, Gracie would be a participant in one of history's most horrific nights. Following an evening of squash, a dip in the ship's pool, and a Sunday church service, Gracie was rudely awakened at 11:40 pm by the abrupt shutdown of Titanic's engines. Without hesitation, he assisted women and children into lifeboats, procuring blankets to protect them from the cold.When the ship finally went down into the Atlantic waves, Gracie crawled onto an upturned collapsible boat with other survivors. In the blackness, frantic swimmers cried out for assistance, but fear of capsizing prevented those on board from taking on more. Gracie remembered with sorrow that over half the men holding on to the upturned boat died before dawn, exhausted and chilled.""In no instance, I am happy to say, did I hear any word of rebuke,"" Gracie wrote in his later memoir, The Truth About the Titanic, recounting the final moments of those left behind, some offering blessings rather than curses.Col. Gracie's eye-witness account is still one of the most detailed and graphic accounts of the tragedy. The auctioneers titled the letter an invaluable relic, ""It is impossible to overstate the rarity of this lot,"" they added. ""Written by one of the most famous survivors, it captures a moment frozen in time.""","Col. Archibald Gracie was one of the Titanic's most distinguished survivors.

Kamala Harris trolled for her Met Gala look: ‘Cruella did it better’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-trolled-for-her-met-gala-look-cruella-did-it-better/articleshow/120919558.cms,"



Former Vice President Kamala Harris became the centre of online mockery following her debut at the 2025 Met Gala, where her black-and-cream ensemble quickly drew comparisons to Disney villain Cruella de Vil . The 60-year-old politician appeared at the star-studded event alongside her husband, Doug Emhoff, wearing a custom design captured in a Vogue portrait by former White House photographer Cameron Smith. But rather than praise, social media users greeted the outfit with ridicule.The annual gala, themed this year around Black dandyism, featured striking looks from A-listers like Zendaya, Colman Domingo, and Lewis Hamilton. While many guests were lauded for creativity and flair, Harris’s appearance struck the wrong chord with viewers online.“She’s going for Cruella de Vil, but Cruella did it better,” one user quipped on X, formerly Twitter. Another joked, “Keep her away from the Dalmatians!” Others mocked the outfit as resembling a curtain or something out of Jordan Peterson’s wardrobe. “The designer of this fashion crime… straight to jail,” one user wrote.A popular meme dubbed her “Kamala de Vil,” a nickname that quickly trended.Off-White’s creative director IB Kamara called the dress “precise simplicity” that “complements her strength and confidence.” Vogue Magazine also praised the styling, though online audiences weren’t convinced. “This dress makes Kamala look like she put on at least 50 pounds,” another user posted. “Not even pretending to be in touch with everyday Americans, I see,” someone else added.Rumours of Harris attending the Met Gala began after she and Emhoff were spotted at Manhattan’s exclusive Polo Bar the night before. Their high-security entourage included NYPD officers and seven black SUVs, with agents guarding the area while the couple mingled with diners. The sight only fuelled criticism that Harris was out of touch with ordinary voters, particularly given the steep $75,000 ticket price for the event.The gala, held every first Monday in May, raised an expected $31 million for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute this year. While stars like Pharrell Williams, Rihanna, and Doechii embraced the evening’s theme with style and swagger, Harris’s outfit became an unintended punchline. As one viral comment summed it up: “Imagine if this woman were president — would she even work an 8-hour day?”",Former Vice President Kamala Harris wore a custom Off-White dress to the 2025 Met Gala.

Ivanka Trump’s bodyguard shoved a man after he repeatedly tried to approach her and her husband, Jared Kushner, in Miami on Saturday night. A video of the incident, now viral on TikTok, shows the tense moment as the bodyguard intervenes when the man, who was carrying a Manila folder, attempts to sidle up to the couple outside the Carbone Beach venue.The clip, which has garnered significant attention online, begins with the Kushners walking toward a waiting car when the unidentified man approaches them. Dressed in tan shorts and a black T-shirt, he makes a move towards the pair, prompting Ivanka’s bodyguard, dressed in black trousers and a purple shirt, to step in and block him. The bodyguard initially pushes the man away gently, but when the man swats the guard’s hand aside and tries to advance once more, the security personnel responds by forcefully shoving him in the chest. The impact sends the man flying backward off camera.Ivanka and Jared briefly turn around to assess the situation before quickly being ushered into their SUV.The incident, which occurred at a high-profile event attended by just 400 guests, was met with mixed reactions. One Twitter user wrote, “Holy smokes. Ivanka Trump’s security guard does not mess around,” while another quipped, “Do NOT mess with the Trump family!” Others on social media debated the appropriateness of the response, with one suggesting, “Bet she fires him anyway.That was excessive and not a good look. ” Another commenter defended the guard, saying, “The white guy was being a jerk... The guard HAD to respond in a microsecond because he literally didn’t have time to check if a handgun was coming out or not.”The glitzy event, which saw tickets priced at $3,000, included a performance by Jelly Roll, NYPost reported.","Ivanka Trump’s bodyguard shoved a man after he repeatedly tried to approach her and her husband, Jared Kushner, in Miami on Saturday night.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings .

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

Monaco E-Prix Round 6 highlights





Pit Boost in Formula E double-headers

Nissan driver Oliver Rowland won Part 1 of the Monaco E-Prix on Saturday. He is already leading the Formula E Drivers' Standings this year, and the much-awaited win adds to his score. Nyck de Vries of Mahindra Racing secured the second spot on the podium. Andretti driver Jake Dennis managed to claim the third spot despite a 5-second penalty.The race began with qualifying winner NEOM McLaren’s Taylor Barnard on pole position, followed by good friend — Nissan’s Oliver Rowland — and then Cupra Kiro driver Dan Ticktum, who topped both free practice sessions.The race ended early for TAG Heuer Porsche driver António Félix da Costa, who crashed into the wall and retired. He remains the only Formula E driver in the last five years to have won both pole and the race in the same event — in 2021. He had finished third in the previous race in Miami.Mitch Evans of Jaguar TCS Racing, who won the last Monaco E-Prix, came to a halt during the race and struggled to get going again, losing precious time as others overtook him.Oliver Rowland was among the first to use Attack Mode and established his dominance in the race. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries and TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein came close to Rowland when others took the mandatory Pit Boost. Soon after, Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy moved up to challenge for second position.Where did pole winner Taylor Barnard go? He crashed into the wall and was seen reversing his vehicle to rejoin the race. Andretti driver Jake Dennis could have secured a higher podium finish, but he was hit with a 5-second penalty for overspeeding during the full-course yellow when António Félix da Costa’s car was being removed from the crash site.Pit Boost is a feature introduced in Formula E double-headers. The electric Gen3 Evo cars receive a 10 percent energy boost (3.85 kWh) via a 30-second, 600kW charge in the pit lane. However, a driver can use this advantage only once across the two races in a double-header.","Nissan driver Oliver Rowland won Part 1 of the Monaco E-Prix on Saturday.

Bill Belichick calls Jordon Hudson his 'muse' in his new memoir that reveals their growing bond and brand plans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/bill-belichick-calls-jordon-hudson-his-muse-in-his-new-memoir-that-reveals-their-growing-bond-and-brand-plans/articleshow/120946505.cms,"Bill Belichick honors girlfriend Jordon Hudson as his muse in new memoir, revealing her support and involvement behind the scenes.

Bill Belichick credits girlfriend Jordon Hudson as his ‘muse’ and the force behind his next chapter



Legendary NFL coach Bill Belichick used his latest memoir The Art of Winning: Lessons From My Life in Football to publicly honor someone who’s recently become a meaningful part of his life—not from the football field, but from his personal journey. The 73-year-old former Patriots general manager dedicated a touching note in the acknowledgments to 24-year-old girlfriend Jordon Hudson , calling her his “idea mill and creative muse.”While Bill Belichick’s new book dives into the highs and lows of his celebrated career, it also pulls back the curtain on his life beyond the gridiron. Alongside mentions of his late parents, grandparents, godfather, and three children from his marriage to Debby Clarke Belichick, Hudson’s name appeared prominently—though not in the traditional dedications. Instead, she earned a heartfelt thank-you among the supporters who helped bring his memoir to life.""Thank you to my idea mill and creative muse, Jordon Hudson,"" Belichick wrote, offering a glimpse into the close bond the pair share. This shout-out follows his gratitude for long-time confidant Berj Najarian and his publishing partners at InkWell Management and Simon & Schuster.Hudson’s presence has been far from behind-the-scenes. During a CBS Sunday Morning interview last month, her surprise interjection made headlines after Belichick was asked how they met. “Not talking about this,” she cut in, sparking a viral moment that drew both criticism and curiosity online.Still, her role isn’t confined to media spectacle. Listed as a former part-time COO of Belichick Productions on LinkedIn, Hudson seems to have played a real role in the book's production. Beyond titles, she also stood by Belichick during a period of mounting media attention. When an excerpt from the memoir was reportedly misinterpreted, she posted an email from Belichick himself expressing frustration over the media's approach to his interviews.“These appearances will, no doubt, want to focus on whatever negatives they can extract from the book… most relevant to their 'ratings' and their agenda (which is not mine),” the NFL icon wrote, revealing a more reflective and media-weary side of himself.Though the age gap has sparked conversation, Belichick remains unfazed. “I’ve never been too worried about what everyone else thinks,” he shared candidly during his interview.In a show of support, Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski—hosts of the Dudes on Dudes podcast and former Belichick protégés—defended Hudson’s actions, noting that she was “working with Coach Belichick in the professional world.”For a man known for his tight-lipped persona and stoic demeanor, this acknowledgment was a rare peek into Belichick’s emotional world—a sign that even the most strategic minds sometimes find unexpected inspiration in matters of the heart.Also Read: Josh Allen’s wedding will have 'good booze,' promises GM, who’s impressed by Hailee Steinfeld’s humility","Bill Belichick credits girlfriend Jordon Hudson as his'muse' and the force behind his next chapter in his memoir.
