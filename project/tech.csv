With Aaron Rodgers undecided, Kirk Cousins emerges as top alternative

The Pittsburgh Steelers are currently facing a pivotal moment in their quarterback strategy, with two high-profile names in the spotlight Aaron Rodgers and Kirk Cousins. The team has reportedly offered Rodgers a one-year deal worth $10 million in hopes of bringing his leadership and experience to Pittsburgh. However, Rodgers, now nearing the twilight of his career, has yet to make a firm decision, potentially weighing retirement or a more favorable opportunity.Aaron Rodgers‚Äô indecision has led the Steelers to look at backup options, and Kirk Cousins has emerged as a serious contender. Cousins, who signed a massive four-year, $180 million contract with the Atlanta Falcons, recently found himself unexpectedly sidelined. The Falcons chose to start rookie quarterback Michael Penix Jr., leaving Cousins' future with the team in doubt. Frustrated by the move, Cousins is now open to joining another team where he can continue as a starter, and the Steelers may offer that chance.Just days ahead of the 2025 NFL Draft, reports from The Athletic‚Äôs Dianna Russini suggest that a potential three-team trade is gaining momentum between the Browns, Steelers, and Vikings one that could include veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins. With Cousins openly expressing his desire to move on from the Falcons, Pittsburgh is shaping up to be the most appealing landing spot for him.""It's believed that Cousins would be against any trade that involves sending him to a situation involving a young QB, similar to the situation he faced in Atlanta last year,"" Russini stated, alluding to the entry of rookie Michael Penix Jr., who overtook Cousins for the starting role during the 2024 campaign.Despite his availability, Cousins brings both promise and concern. On the one hand, he offers veteran experience and consistent performance in the regular season. On the other hand, he has a reputation for struggling under pressure, particularly in high-stakes games, and he posted a high number of interceptions in his last season. For the Steelers, who prioritize ball control and limiting turnovers, this could be a significant red flag.Financially, bringing Kirk Cousins to Pittsburgh won‚Äôt be easy. His contract is massive, and the Falcons are reportedly seeking a team willing to take on a substantial portion of his salary. This could become a major obstacle unless both teams agree to a restructuring deal. Still, if the Steelers decide that Cousins is the right fit, they may be willing to negotiate.Currently, the Steelers' quarterback depth includes Mason Rudolph, Skylar Thompson, and rookie Will Howard. While all three have potential, none bring the same level of experience or immediate impact that Rodgers or Cousins could offer. The Steelers are clearly looking for a proven starter to elevate their playoff hopes in a competitive AFC.Also Read: Are the Jets setting themselves up for disaster? Ignoring defensive tackles in record-breaking NFL Draft could be a colossal mistake In the end, the decision hinges on Aaron Rodgers‚Äô choice. If he declines, the Steelers must weigh whether Kirk Cousins is worth the financial and performance risk. Either way, Pittsburgh Steelers appears committed to making a bold move at quarterback in 2025.","Pittsburgh Steelers have reportedly offered Aaron Rodgers a one-year deal worth $10 million.

A long-standing rivalry between Antonio Brown and Ben Roethlisberger: The origins of their bad blood



The feud between former Pittsburgh Steelers stars Antonio Brown and Ben Roethlisberger has been one of the most dramatic in NFL history , but it just got even more bizarre. In a recent twist, Brown dropped a bombshell, claiming that he once hooked up with Roethlisberger‚Äôs sister during the 2011 Pro Bowl. This revelation has sent shockwaves through social media, adding fuel to an already intense rivalry. Fans are now wondering: just how deep does this animosity go?In a recent tweet, Antonio Brown claimed that during the 2011 Pro Bowl, he and Roethlisberger‚Äôs sister had a one-night fling.Brown stated, leaving fans and media alike reeling.This revelation comes at a time when both players have long since left the Steelers, but their beef seems to have evolved from professional disagreements to something far more personal.The timing of this revelation is also significant while Roethlisberger has retired, Brown‚Äôs career has been marred by controversy, with his behavior frequently making headlines. But this latest bombshell may just be his most jaw-dropping move yet.The reaction from fans has been explosive. On social media, many are calling out Brown for airing such personal details in public, while others are applauding him for his unapologetic attitude.Antonio Brown and Ben Roethlisberger‚Äôs feud has been simmering for years, dating back to Brown‚Äôs time with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Brown has often criticized Roethlisberger, calling out his leadership style and claiming mistreatment during their time together.

In a landmark modernization effort, the US Social Security Administration (SSA) is preparing to roll out a secure, digital method for Americans to access their Social Security numbers (SSNs) online. Starting in early summer 2025, individuals with a My Social Security account will be able to view their SSNs directly through the SSA portal.This initiative is aimed at reducing reliance on traditional paper-based cards, cutting wait times for replacements, and enhancing user convenience and security. The move reflects SSA‚Äôs broader goal of adapting to digital trends while safeguarding sensitive personal information in an increasingly cyber-connected world. As identity theft and administrative backlogs continue to pose challenges, this digital SSN access marks a critical shift in how Americans interact with their most essential federal identification number.Historically, Americans have had to rely on physical Social Security cards for documentation of their SSN. If a card was lost or stolen, individuals were required to request a replacement either by mail or in person‚Äîa process that could take days or even weeks. With this new enhancement, users of the My Social Security platform will be able to view their SSN online via smartphone or computer at any time.The SSA has confirmed that the digital SSN service will become available in early summer 2025.

How to play NYT Connections



Keep it simple

Don't analyse the connections too deeply.

The game tends to employ simple links such as sounding similar, similar spellings, or common themes.

Example: ""dear"" and ""deer"" tend to be linked by sound, not by some elaborate relationship such as predator and prey.

Exercise caution with your guesses

You have only four guesses per puzzle per day, so every guess matters.

Don't mindlessly click‚Äîconsider each set carefully before submitting.

Try to come up with at least three connected words confidently before trying a set.

Employ the shuffle button

The initial organization is deliberately mischievous to mislead you.

Shuffling the words may allow you to see new patterns or concealed connections.

Shuffle it as a routine to begin and whenever you are stuck.

"Titanic survivor‚Äôs haunting letter written days before sinking sells for record ¬£300,000 at auction; here‚Äôs what it said",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/titanic-survivors-haunting-letter-sells-for-record-300000-at-auction/articleshow/120680669.cms,"A rare letter penned by Colonel Archibald Gracie , one of the Titanic‚Äôs most distinguished survivors, has fetched a record ¬£300,000, a fivefold increase on its estimated price, at an auction in Wiltshire, as a new high price for Titanic correspondence was smashed.The letter, dated April 10, 1912, the very day Gracie boarded the Titanic, offers a chilling glimpse into the final days before disaster struck. Written on a Titanic letter card and postmarked in Queenstown and London, it is ominous in tone, with the following ominous words: ""It is a fine ship but I shall await my journey's end before I pass judgment on her.""Auctioneer Henry Aldridge and Son described it as ""a truly exceptional, museum-grade piece,"" saying it is the record price for a Titanic letter. Survivor letters of Gracie's stature are extremely rare, with this one never previously on the market.The four-page letter, written to a family acquaintance who befriended Gracie at the London Waldorf Hotel, is warm in its reminiscence about his earlier crossings on the Oceanic, remembering, ""Her sea-worthy qualities and yacht-like appearance make me miss her,"" while also marveling at the size of the Titanic.Days later, Gracie would be a participant in one of history's most horrific nights. Following an evening of squash, a dip in the ship's pool, and a Sunday church service, Gracie was rudely awakened at 11:40 pm by the abrupt shutdown of Titanic's engines. Without hesitation, he assisted women and children into lifeboats, procuring blankets to protect them from the cold.When the ship finally went down into the Atlantic waves, Gracie crawled onto an upturned collapsible boat with other survivors. In the blackness, frantic swimmers cried out for assistance, but fear of capsizing prevented those on board from taking on more. Gracie remembered with sorrow that over half the men holding on to the upturned boat died before dawn, exhausted and chilled.""In no instance, I am happy to say, did I hear any word of rebuke,"" Gracie wrote in his later memoir, The Truth About the Titanic, recounting the final moments of those left behind, some offering blessings rather than curses.Col. Gracie's eye-witness account is still one of the most detailed and graphic accounts of the tragedy. The auctioneers titled the letter an invaluable relic, ""It is impossible to overstate the rarity of this lot,"" they added. ""Written by one of the most famous survivors, it captures a moment frozen in time.""","Col. Archibald Gracie was one of the Titanic's most distinguished survivors.

People were deceived. Accusations of dishonesty, bad ethics and even illegality flew. But the man behind it, Colamedici, insists it was not a hoax; rather, he described it as a "" philosophical experiment ,"" saying that it helps to show how AI will ""slowly but inevitably destroy our capacity to think.""Colamedici is an Italian publisher who - along with two AI tools - generated ""Hypnocracy: Trump, Musk, and the Architecture of Reality,"" a buzzy text ostensibly written by Jianwei Xun, the non-existent philosopher. In Dec, Colamedici's press printed 70 copies of an Italian edition that he supposedly translated. Still, the book quickly gained outsize attention, being covered by media outlets in Germany, Spain, Italy and France, and being cited by tech luminaries.""Hypnocracy"" describes how powerful people use technology to shape perception with ""hypnotic narratives,"" putting the public in a kind of collective trance that may be exacerbated by relying on AI.The book, Colamedici said, was meant to show the dangers of ""cognitive apathy"" that could develop if thinking were delegated to machines and if people don't cultivate their discernment. ""I tried to create a performance, an experience that is not just the book."" Colamedici teaches what he calls ""the art of prompting,"" or how to ask AI smart questions and give it actionable instructions, at the European Institute of Design in Rome. He tries to teach users how to discern fact from fabrication.The book is an extension of this effort, he said. The AI tools he used helped him to refine the ideas, while clues (real and invented) about the fake author, intentionally suggested potential problems to prompt readers to ask questions, he said. The first chapter discusses fake authorship, for example, and the book contains obscure references to Italian culture unlikely to come from a young philosopher from Hong Kong, which eventually helped to lead one reviewer to the true author operating as a translator. Sabina Minardi, an editor at Italian outlet L'Espresso, picked up on the clues, exposing Jianwei Xun as a fake in early April. Colamedici then updated the fake author's bio page, spoke to publications, including some deceived by his work. New editions and excerpts come with postscripts about the truth.But some who first embraced the book now question whether Colamedici has acted unethically or broken a EU law on AI. French news outlet Le Figaro wrote about ""L'affaire Jianwei Xun,"" explaining the ""problem"" with its earlier interview of the Hong Kong philosopher was that ""he doesn't exist."" Spanish newspaper El Pais retracted a report, replacing it with a note that said ""the book failed to acknowledge AI's involvement in the creation of the text, a violation of the new European AI Act."" Colamedici is disappointed some initial champions have decried the experiment. He said he plans to have Jianwei Xun - describing it as a collective of humans and artificial intelligence - teach a course about AI next fall.

TOI Correspondent from London:

Over the years, patrons of Britain‚Äôs oldest Indian restaurant, ‚ÄòVeeraswamy‚Äô, have included Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Charlie Chaplin, Winston Churchill, Marlon Brando, Sharon Stone and David Cameron.A haunt of Indian maharajas and European royalty too, the King of Denmark even shipped out a cask of Carlsberg for staff to store for whenever he dined there.Now the Michelin-starred restaurant , which opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London, and today serves pineapple curry and chicken makhana au vin, is at threat of closure as the Crown Estate (property portfolio owned by King Charles), which owns Victory House, the building in which the restaurant is based, is refusing to renew its lease, which expires in June.The Crown Estate claims it needs to take the restaurant space back to extend the ground floor reception for offices on the building‚Äôs upper floors. Knocking through into Veeraswamy would give it an extra 11 sq mts.Veeraswamy‚Äôs founder, Edward Palmer, was the great-grandson of General William Palmer, and his wife, Begum Faiz Baksh, a Mughal princess. Gen Palmer was private secretary to Warren Hastings, first governor-general of the Presidency of Fort William. It was acquired by Ranjit Mathrani and Namita Panjabi in 1996.‚ÄúHad they wanted to, they could‚Äôve easily put the office reception on the first floor. I think they‚Äôve come to the view that it‚Äôs too tiresome having a restaurant there, they want it to be all offices,‚Äù Mathrani (81), told the Times of London.If the Crown Estate refuses to allow the restaurant to stay put until he finds and fit out an alternative space, with its iconic d√©cor inspired by the art nouveau of the 1920s and maharaja‚Äôs palaces, the restaurant will have to close, leading to possible redundancies and loss of business until a new site is found.Mathrani is taking the Crown Estate to court.A spokesperson for The Crown Estate told TOI: ‚ÄúThe Crown Estate has a duty to generate value for the nation, while acting as responsible stewards for this historic part of London. We need to carry out a comprehensive refurbishment of Victory House. This includes a major upgrade to the offices and improving the entrance to make it more accessible. Due to the limited options available in this listed building we need to remove the entrance to the restaurant, which means we will not be able to offer Veeraswamy an extension when their lease expires.‚Äù","Michelin-starred restaurant Veeraswamy opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

WhatsApp launches ‚ÄòPrivate Processing‚Äô to enhance AI chat privacy: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/whatsapp-launches-private-processing-to-enhance-ai-chat-privacy-report/articleshow/120797571.cms,"WhatsApp Private Processing

What is Private Processing

User-initiated and entirely optional

No retention of messages after the session ends

Unauditable by Meta, WhatsApp, or third-party vendors post-session

Supports end-to-end encryption principles

WhatsApp‚Äôs 'Private Processing' secures AI chats with no data stored

The system does not retain user messages, even temporarily, for future use.

Even if a hacker gains access to Meta‚Äôs infrastructure, they would be unable to access historical Private Processing interactions.

Additional safeguards:

Meta is integrating Private Processing into its bug bounty program, encouraging ethical hackers to identify potential vulnerabilities before launch.

A detailed security engineering design paper will be released ahead of the full rollout, outlining the architecture, privacy logic, and threat models.

Meta will allow independent audits to verify that the feature meets stated privacy expectations and performs securely in real-world environments.

Meta‚Äôs Private Processing vs. Apple‚Äôs Private Cloud Compute

Feature

Meta‚Äôs Private Processing

Apple‚Äôs PCC

Deployment Platform

WhatsApp (cloud-based AI interaction)

iOS/macOS devices with server fallback

Default Status

Optional and user-initiated

On-device by default; uses PCC as fallback

Data Retention

No message retention post-session

Minimal and encrypted when stored briefly

Obfuscation Protocol

OHTTP (Oblivious HTTP) via third-party

OHTTP used for obscuring user IPs

Auditability

Independent third-party verification

Apple audits and claims verifiable design



Role of OHTTP and third-party relays

Meta can see the request content but not the user‚Äôs identity.

The relay provider sees the IP address but not the content.

Auditability and transparency measures

Independent researchers and privacy watchdogs can audit Private Processing.

The bug bounty program enables ongoing white-hat testing.

A soon-to-be-published security white paper will provide the technical blueprint of the system, enabling academic scrutiny.

Broader implications for messaging privacy and AI integration

Private Processing launch timeline and availability

Be available to WhatsApp users in selected regions in the coming weeks.

Roll out initially as an opt-in feature.

Eventually integrate more AI capabilities as the infrastructure matures and proves secure.

Meta, the parent company of WhatsApp, has unveiled a new feature aimed at strengthening user privacy while engaging with artificial intelligence tools within the app. The feature, titled ""Private Processing,"" is designed to allow users to interact with Meta AI in a more secure and confidential manner. Unlike standard AI chats or queries processed over traditional cloud infrastructure, Private Processing ensures that neither Meta, WhatsApp, nor third-party entities can access the user‚Äôs data once the session ends.According to Meta‚Äôs announcement, this function will be optional and is expected to roll out in the coming weeks. The company claims the system is designed with both privacy and auditability in mind, featuring enhanced protections against external and internal threats. Meta has also taken steps to make the system verifiable by independent parties and more resistant to cyberattacks, further aligning itself with evolving privacy standards in the tech industry.Private Processing is a confidential AI interaction system being added to WhatsApp that enables users to interact with Meta AI without leaving data traces that can be accessed later. When enabled, it provides a temporary processing session for tasks such as generating AI summaries, retrieving information, or engaging in chat-based queries, all without storing or linking the user‚Äôs messages to identifiable metadata once the interaction ends.Key characteristics:Meta emphasises that Private Processing is built with security at its core. Once the AI completes a user‚Äôs request, the session data is discarded, ensuring that:The Private Processing model bears similarities to Apple‚Äôs Private Cloud Compute (PCC), a system introduced for confidential cloud-based AI interactions. Both aim to achieve secure, privacy-respecting processing outside the user‚Äôs device by using advanced cryptographic protocols and secure hardware environments.While both systems use Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP) to hide user IP addresses from Meta or Apple, Meta‚Äôs implementation is user-triggered, whereas Apple‚Äôs approach favors on-device processing by default, switching to PCC when server-side processing is necessary.A core component of Private Processing is its reliance on Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP), a web standard that separates IP address visibility from the content being processed. Requests made to Meta‚Äôs servers are relayed through independent third-party providers, ensuring that:This privacy split ensures no single party has access to both the user‚Äôs identity and request content, creating a privacy-preserving pipeline for AI queries.To maintain public trust, Meta has built in mechanisms for external verification:Meta‚Äôs approach aligns with emerging industry standards demanding that privacy-focused claims be independently verifiable and not rely solely on corporate assurances.The introduction of Private Processing indicates a growing shift in how large tech companies balance AI capabilities with user privacy demands. As more users become concerned about data surveillance, profiling, and cyberthreats, features like Private Processing represent an effort to offer control back to the user while still allowing for advanced functionalities like chat-based AI support.With messaging apps becoming hubs for AI-powered tools, ensuring confidentiality of queries and outputs is critical to maintaining both compliance with global privacy regulations and user confidence.According to Meta, Private Processing will:Users will be able to enable or disable the feature from within WhatsApp‚Äôs AI tools settings, giving them complete control over when and how their data is processed.","WhatsApp's 'Private Processing' secures AI chats with no data stored.

As per Apple these types of attacks are far more complex as compared to typical cybercriminal activity or general malware.

As per Apple‚Äôs support page, Mercenary spyware attacks are exceptionally well funded and they evolve over time. Apple relies solely on internal threat-intelligence information and investigations to detect such attacks.Such attacks are vastly more complex than regular cybercriminal activity and consumer malware, as mercenary spyware attackers apply exceptional resources to target a very small number of specific individuals and their devices.
