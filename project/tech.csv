Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

In a recent interview with The Verge, Huffman described efforts to block these companies as ""a real pain in the ass.""""We've had Microsoft, Anthropic , and Perplexity act as though all of the content on the internet is free for them to use,"" Huffman told The Verge.He specifically criticized Microsoft for using Reddit's data ""without telling us"" to train its AI and summarize content in Bing search results.Huffman explained the rationale behind blocking these companies: ""Without these agreements, we don't have any say or knowledge of how our data is displayed and what it's used for, which has put us in a position now of blocking folks who haven't been willing to come to terms with how we'd like our data to be used or not used.""In early July, Reddit updated its robots.txt file to block web crawlers from companies without agreements. This resulted in Reddit results disappearing from Microsoft's Bing search engine while remaining visible on Google.Huffman argued that the traditional value exchange between search engines and content platforms has evolved. ""When it was used for simple search, to create simple links that would send us traffic from search engines, that was fine,"" he told Bloomberg. ""But now folks are using Reddit data for training, they're reselling it, they're doing search summaries instead of linking to us.""He further elaborated to The Verge, ""I think the traditional value exchange from search engines has changed. Search and summarization and training are merging, and the value exchange of crawling in exchange for traffic back is becoming muddied.""Reddit has already struck deals with Google and OpenAI , allowing them to access its data for a fee. Google reportedly agreed to pay $60 million annually for this access. So, Microsoft’s Bing and other search engines apparently don’t have the access to Reddit, so they can’t show the result in their search.Microsoft's head of search, Jordi Ribas, responded on social media platform X that ""Reddit has blocked Bing from crawling their site for search, favoring another search engine and impacting competition from Bing and Bing-powered engines."" However, a Microsoft spokesperson stated that the company honors websites' directions regarding content usage for AI models.The Reddit CEO pointed to OpenAI's recent SearchGPT announcement as a model for future agreements. However, Reddit spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt clarified that none of the site's existing content deals are exclusive.While Anthropic told the Verge that Reddit has been on their block list for web crawling since mid-May, Microsoft and Perplexity did not comment on the matter.Huffman's stance sends a clear message: the era of freely scraping online content for AI training may be coming to an end. ""The traditional value exchange from search engines has changed,"" he emphasized.","Reddit CEO Steve Huffman has called out Microsoft and other AI companies for using Reddit's data to train their AI models without permission or compensation.

Anand Mahindra said that artificial intelligence (AI) can be of more value to mankind than ‘imagined’. Citing a research that showed how AI can detect breast cancer five years before it develops, he wrote ""If this is accurate, then AI is going to be of significantly more value to us than we imagined and much earlier than we had imagined,"".The Mahindra Group chairman took to microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to share his views.Recently, a team of researchers from Duke University in the US developed a new AI model to predict 5-year breast cancer risk from mammograms.Traditional cancer diagnosis relies on biopsies, microscopic histological examinations, and imaging techniques like MRI, CT, and PET scans. Human interpretation of these tests can be subjective. AI, on the other hand, can analyse medical images with staggering accuracy.An IANS report quotes Vineet Nakra, a radiation oncologist at Max Super Speciality Hospital on how AI is helping in cancer diagnosis and treatment. She told the news agency that AI is helping pathologists diagnose cancer much faster and paving the way for doctors to make personalised and patient-centric cancer care.Commenting on Mahindra’s X post, a user wrote “That's the best use of technology anyway. Assisting human kind to become better and reduce risks”. “AI in the medical field will have a huge impact and will certainly make significant contributions. Google DeepMind's AI system, AlphaFold3, can accurately predict the 3D structure of proteins and has potential applications in drug discovery and understanding diseases,” commented another.“AI, Machine Learning, Big data analysis based systems will drastically improve the living standards of life of every strata of society,” replied a third.","The Mahindra Group chairman took to microblogging platform X to share his views.

"UK, EU question Elon Musk’s X over use of data to train Grok AI: What they said",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uk-eu-question-elon-musks-x-over-use-of-data-to-train-grok-ai-what-they-said/articleshow/112082799.cms,"Also Read:

How X’s auto-consent flouts tech rules in the UK, EU

Elon Musk-owned X recently enabled by default a setting that allows the social media platform to utilise user data to train its AI model, Grok. This means X can use user posts, interactions, and outputs from Grok for training and refining its AI, requiring users to manually opt-out. Now the regulators in the UK and the European Union ( EU ) have reportedly connected with the company over its alleged attempt to gain user consent for data harvesting without their approval.While X claims this data is essential for improving user experience, privacy concerns have been raised. The setting states that users “allow your posts as well as your interactions, inputs and results with Grok to be used for training and fine-tuning”.Users have expressed difficulty in disabling this feature as the option is currently hidden within the web app's settings and unavailable on the mobile app.The move contradicts the tech laws in both the regions as the regulations prohibit pre-ticked consent boxes. Tech companies are not allowed to use “pre-ticked boxes” or “any other method of default consent”.Data protection authorities in the UK and Ireland have expressed their concerns over X's actions, as per a report by the Guardian. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is investigating the matter, emphasising the importance of transparency and user choice in data usage.“Platforms seeking to use their users’ data to train their AI foundation models must be transparent about their activities,” said a spokesperson for the ICO.“They should take steps to proactively notify users well in advance of using data for these purposes, and provide people with ample time and simple processes to object to having their data used in this way,” the spokesperson added.Similarly, Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), the lead regulator for X in the EU, has expressed surprise at the development and is seeking further information from the company.“The DPC has been engaging with X on this matter for a number of months, with our latest interaction occurring as recently as yesterday, therefore we are surprised by today’s developments. We have followed up with X today (July 26) and are awaiting a response. We expect further engagement early next week,” said Graham Doyle, a DPC deputy commissioner.","X recently enabled by default a setting that allows the social media platform to utilise user data to train its AI model, Grok.
