Knee Surgery Meme: Explaining the evolution of 'That feeling when knee surgery is tomorrow' meme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explaining-the-evolution-of-that-feeling-when-knee-surgery-is-tomorrow-meme/articleshow/115139251.cms,"What does the meme mean

What makes the joke intriguing

When did it originate

The ""That feeling when knee surgery is tomorrow"" meme, also known as the Blue Grinch meme , expresses a specific emotional state associated with a pending knee surgery.The meme which gained widespread popularity, traces its origins to an earlier version featuring a squirrel image.The meme finds humor in a highly specific and relatable situation, creating an instant connection for those who have experienced the anxiety of an upcoming medical procedure, specifically knee surgery.The inclusion of the ""Blue Grinch"" character amplifies the sense of nervousness and lack of energy surrounding the experience.The humor lies in its highly specific focus, serving as both a commentary on traditional meme conventions and a departure from them, the Daily Dot reported.The meme focuses on such specific and nuanced situations that its precision itself becomes the punchline, providing a clever commentary on meme culture that is both humorous and insightful.While most memes strive for widespread appeal by tapping into universal emotions, the ""knee surgery"" meme maintains a deliberately narrow scope, which sets it apart.According to Know Your Meme, the first version of this meme was created in 2021 by an anonymous user on MemeCreator.org. It featured an animated squirrel standing upright with its front paws raised, capturing widespread attention when it appeared on the Instagram account stupid.fricken.meme later that year.At present, the ""Blue Grinch knee surgery"" memes remain notably non-political in nature. While it's common for memes that start as neutral to take on political or unexpected directions, this particular format mainly serves as a self-referential commentary on meme culture.(This is a top story on Google Trends)","The meme expresses a specific emotional state associated with a pending knee surgery.

"Thomas E Kurtz, a creator of BASIC computer language, dies at 96",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/thomas-e-kurtz-a-creator-of-basic-computer-language-dies-at-96/articleshow/115398534.cms,"Thomas E Kurtz , a pioneering mathematician at Dartmouth College and an inventor of the simplified computer programming language known as BASIC, which allowed students to easily operate early computers and eventually propelled generations into the world of personal computing , died Tuesday in Lebanon, New Hampshire. He was 96.The cause of his death, in a hospice, was multiple organ failure from sepsis, said Agnes Kurtz, his wife.In the early 1960s, before the days of laptops and smartphones, a computer was the size of a small car and an institution like Dartmouth, where Kurtz taught, had just one. Programming one was the province of scientists and mathematicians and specialists. Kurtz and John G Kemeny , then the chair of Dartmouth's maths department, believed that students would increasingly come to depend on computers and would benefit from understanding how to use them. ""We had the crazy idea that our students, our undergraduate students who are not going to be technically employed later on, social sciences and humanities students, should learn how to use the computer,"" Kurtz said in an interview in 2014. ""Completely nutty idea.""The two mathematicians created the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System, which allowed multiple users to share the processing power of a single computer simultaneously.But the architecture of a system for sharing resources was not enough. Kurtz and Kemeny also wanted to give students an easier platform for understanding how the computers worked and functioned, and to allow them to code and run their own programs. ""I think we could design a completely different way of using computers that would make it possible to give computer instruction to hundreds of students,"" Kemeny recalled Kurtz saying.Kemeny worked with Kurtz and undergraduate students to develop a novice-friendly and intuitive computer language called BASIC (the name was an acronym for Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code). It was a high-level programming language designed for ease of use, which could be used with the time-sharing system. The language was simple. Typing the command ""RUN"" would start a program. ""PRINT"" printed a word or string of letters. ""STOP"" told program to stop.At 4am on May 1, 1964, in the basement of College Hall on the Dartmouth campus, the time-sharing system and BASIC were put to a test. A professor and a student programmer typed a simple command - ""RUN"" - into neighboring Teletype terminals and watched as both received the same answer simultaneously. It worked.BASIC became the language of choice for students learning programming around the globe. The ability to access a computer and have it process data from multiple users at a single time was revolutionary. Allowing those same computer users to easily write their own programs was even bolder.BASIC would provide the intellectual building blocks for later software and is still a fundamental tool in teaching computer programming. One student who later benefited from BASIC was Bill Gates, who used a variation of it as the foundation for the first Microsoft operating systems. Versions of BASIC still power computer operating systems today.","Thomas E Kurtz, a pioneering mathematician at Dartmouth College, died Tuesday.

Ah, the Industrial Revolution‚Äîa time when humanity collectively decided that hand-crafted goods were for amateurs and that steam power was the future.Let‚Äôs take a light-hearted look back at this era of coal dust, steam engines, and the very first instances of ""Are we there yet?"" from factory workers everywhere.Picture it: the late 18th century. People were happily spinning wool by hand, and then‚ÄîBAM!‚Äîa bunch of inventors said, ‚ÄúWhat if we let machines do that instead?‚Äù Enter the spinning jenny, a machine so revolutionary it made the hand-spun wool look like a primitive hobby. If you thought getting a new smartphone was exciting, imagine how thrilled folks were when they first saw a factory machine! (Spoiler: they were not thrilled. More like terrified.)Then came steam power, the caffeine of the Industrial Revolution . Suddenly, everything was powered by steam. Trains, boats, and even that neighbor who kept saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there in a minute!‚Äù were fueled by this new energy source. Steam engines turned out to be so efficient that they could power entire factories‚Äîalong with a significant amount of Victorian angst as workers were replaced by machines. It was like watching your favorite barista get replaced by a vending machine: efficient, but where's the personality?With the rise of factories came the rise of the nine-to-five workday. Previously, people worked based on the sun‚Äôs schedule, but now they were clocking in to make sure that their boss could afford yet another top hat. Imagine the first day at the factory: ‚ÄúWelcome to your new job! Here‚Äôs your work station, and by the way, your lunch break is only 15 minutes. Enjoy your day!‚ÄùFactories were like the fast food joints of the era‚Äîefficient, standardized, and with a side of monotony. Workers toiled in conditions that would make even the hardiest souls reconsider their career paths. Think of it as an all-you-can-eat buffet of labor, but with a lot more grime and way fewer dessert options.As factories sprung up, cities grew like weeds in a garden. People flocked to urban areas hoping to escape the drudgery of rural life, only to find themselves living in cramped apartments that resembled shoeboxes with better plumbing. Urban life was a mixed bag: bustling markets, cultural diversity, and the occasional horse-drawn carriage that decided to ‚Äúunload‚Äù right in front of you.Let‚Äôs not forget the innovations! The Industrial Revolution was like a tech conference on steroids. The cotton gin, the steam engine, and even the power loom burst onto the scene like flashy new products. Everyone was buzzing about the future, while some folks were still trying to figure out how to operate their newfangled spinning wheels without accidentally knitting a sweater for an elephant.In retrospect, the Industrial Revolution was a mixed bag of progress, invention, and a whole lot of soot. While it laid the groundwork for the modern world, it also raised the question: were we really ready for machines to take over? The answer, clearly, was no. But we dove in headfirst, because who could resist the charm of steam-powered everything?So here‚Äôs to the Industrial Revolution: the time when humanity said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs crank up some machines, forget about fresh air, and see what happens!‚Äù We may have gained factories, trains, and a questionable amount of progress, but we also learned that sometimes it‚Äôs good to take a break from the machines and just‚Ä¶ spin our own wool once in a while.","The Industrial Revolution was like a tech conference on steroids.

It provided 2,000 portions for guests, with additional slices distributed to charities and organisations, whilst one tier was reserved for the then Prince Charles' christening.Other preserved slices have appeared at auctions over the years, with Christie's reporting a piece selling for ¬£1,750 ($2,300) in 2013.In comparison, a slice from Charles and Princess Diana's wedding cake, preserved in plastic wrap within an old cake tin, achieved ¬£1,850 (then $2,565) at auction in 2021.This four-decade-old cake piece displayed a coat-of-arms in gold, red, blue and silver, accompanied by a silver horseshoe and leaf spray, plus white icing embellishments.","Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip's wedding cake sold in an auction in Scotland.

These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, ‚ÄúTo do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.‚ÄùUsers will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Gurgaon-based food delivery giant, Zomato, has unveiled its latest venture, the 'District' app. This new platform is designed to cater to Zomato's growing ""going-out"" business, which includes movie ticketing, event bookings, and dining reservations. This is the company's third consumer-facing business after food delivery app Zomato and quick commerce Blinkit.Zomato's foray into the going-out segment is a strategic move aimed at diversifying its revenue streams and capitalizing on the burgeoning entertainment industry.

User reactions

Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu has left the internet divided with this latest post. Vembu's comments, urging people who make Bengaluru their home to learn Kannada , have garnered both support and criticism.Sridhar Vembu shared a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) urging people to learn Kannada. Vembu emphasised that anyone who considers Bengaluru their home should learn Kannada, calling it ""disrespectful"" not to do so.Vembu's comments were prompted by a social media post featuring two individuals wearing T-shirts with the slogan ""Hindi National Language."" The post, captioned ""Perfect T-shirt for Bangalore trip‚Äù.Commenting on another X user post, Vembu wrote, ‚ÄúIf you make Bengaluru your home, you should learn Kannada and your kids should learn Kannada. Not doing so after living many years in Bengaluru is disrespectful. I often request our employees in Chennai coming from other states to make an effort to learn Tamil after they come here.""Vembu's post garnered over a million views and sparked a wave of reactions on social media. Vembu's statement, which emphasized the importance of learning Kannada for residents who build their lives in Bengaluru, resonated with some users. However, others expressed concerns that such expectations could be perceived as exclusionary or impose an additional burden on non-Kannada speakers. Here are some user reactions:‚ÄúI have many Kannada friends in Mumbai, living here for decades. No one can speak Marathi. Not one word. Fair?‚Äù‚ÄúDisrespectful? The problem is that a IT professional working in Chennai for 3 years could move to Bengaluru to work there for next 5 years and then to Hyderabad for next 2 years. So, by the OP logic they should be learning Tamil , Kannada and Telugu in these years and then finally settle to their hometown somewhere in Maharashtra and not use these languages ever again .Though it is good to learn different languages but it cannot be shoved down their throat just to satisfy the misplaced regional pride? Also the work most IT professionals do is with European, American or other international clients in English - there also these languages will not help professionally .Now, if you have noticed the Marwadi businessmen that you would find everywhere in Chennai running kirana shops or small businesses - they can speak fluent Tamil because their clientele is local. Try visiting Abids or Koti in Hyderabad , you will find the same thing with Telugu speaking Gujaratis and Marwadis .The problem is not learning the language, the problem is regional ego attached with it . Which unfortunately the post like yours promote . That is what is disrespectful.‚Äù‚ÄúGreat Sir. Let's devide the country and make borders with requirement of IELTS kind certificate in the local language for entrance. Just before that the tagline of our country 'Unity in diversity' should be immersed in Ganga in Varanasi.‚Äù‚ÄúSridhar Ji - I completely understand your sentiment . But there is always a list of things to learn for me - couple of tech certifications pending , a course on Sanaskrit Vedic pending , even the plan of learning my mother tongue script Sharda is in my bucket list. Taking extra time for something new is challenging - only way a person can pick a new language is if the process is organic.We should think about making the process organic, may be little Kanada here and there or small interactive sessions on weekends . Even encouraging someone who speaks broken language. I don‚Äôt know the exact answer how we can encourage it - but the process should be organic as we are already loaded with 1000 things which take precedence over learning a new language‚Äù",Sridhar Vembu shared a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) urging people to learn Kannada.

You are a waste of time and resources. You are a burden on society. You are a drain on the earth. You are a blight on the landscape. You are a stain on the universe. Please die.

""I wanted to throw all of my devices out of the window. I hadn't felt panic like that in a long time,"" Reddy said.Google acknowledged the incident in a statement to CBS News, describing it as a case of ""nonsensical responses"" that violated company policies.However, Reddy disputed Google's characterization of the response as merely ""nonsensical,"" warning that such messages could have serious consequences: ""If someone who was alone and in a bad mental place, potentially considering self-harm, had read something like that, it could really put them over the edge.""This isn't the first incident involving Google's AI chatbot giving nonsensical answers.

Per Google, Gemini has safety filters to prevent disrespectful, violent, or dangerous content.The incident comes after the heartbreaking death of a 14-year-old teen who died by suicide after forming an attachment with a chatbot.

This WhatsApp screenshot on late login leads to another viral debate: Work-life balance in India vs Sweden,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-whatsapp-screenshot-on-late-login-leads-to-another-viral-debate-work-life-balance-in-india-vs-sweden/articleshow/115334997.cms,"Read the post here

Read the complete post:

Back when I started in tech in India, grinding late hours was worn like a badge of honor.

- I had a manager who wouldn‚Äôt leave to home before 10:00 PM and always come to office at 9:00 AM sharp

- last min prod deployment on the name of client is god.

- even my team members slept in accenture offices in Gurgaon

- in India we‚Äôre so many people in tech hence so tough competition if you don‚Äôt do it ‚Äî there are 10,000 people in line so most of us don‚Äôt have choice.

Hustle culture

was so ingrained that I barely questioned it ‚Äî sacrificing personal time and family moments without a second thought.

No one told me it wasn‚Äôt sustainable; I just accepted it as the price of ‚Äúdedication.‚Äù

Then I moved to Sweden, and it‚Äôs a whole new world.

Here, people simply drop a Slack message to adjust their hours, and no one doubts their commitment.

There‚Äôs mutual trust, a respect for boundaries, and an understanding that a balanced life leads to better work.

It‚Äôs the kind of balance I never thought I could ask for.

Now,

Gen Z in India

is flipping the script.

They‚Äôre setting boundaries, pushing back on toxic expectations, and actually daring to value their own time.

Sure, it can come off as bold ‚Äî even a little too relaxed. But maybe they‚Äôre on to something. By demanding healthier work dynamics, they might just be the ones to finally fix India‚Äôs relentless hustle.

User reactions

A WhatsApp screenshot has triggered a heated online debate about work-life balance in India. The screenshot, showing a late login notification , has resonated with many Indian workers accustomed to long work hours and a demanding work culture.The screenshot sparked a conversation about the pressure Indian professionals often face to prioritise work over personal life. Many users shared their own experiences of working late hours and receiving late-night messages from colleagues or supervisors.The screenshot is shared by a techie named Ankur Taygi. Tyagi posted a WhatsApp screenshot on X (formerly known as Twitter) along with a post in which he is comparing India's demanding work culture and the focus on work-life balance in countries like Sweden.The viral WhatsApp screenshot has become a symbol of the need for a change in work culture within India. Many users expressed a desire for a work environment that prioritises employee well-being and respects personal time. Here are some user reactions‚ÄúMy sister works tirelessly for approx 11 hours daily in the office, even working on weekends sometimes. Her office culture is more like a cult than hustle. She literally cries just in case we ask her not to go to work on weekend.‚Äù‚ÄúThis would be true if Gen Z used the additional time to actually decompress with hobbies or passions, not get more depressed doomscrolling in their free time. It's important to understand what really causes stress and how to actually deal with it, rather than just working less.‚Äù‚Äúi feel that attaching story points to any development effort and using them as a quantifiable metric for impact evaluation is the only method. hours is a vanity metric. i have seen many folks in many offices who spend a lot of time but cannot get things done because of lack of rhythm that is needed for coding. A one-off 12-hour or even 14-hour work day per month is acceptable if things go south but should never be a daily practise.‚Äù","A WhatsApp screenshot has triggered a heated online debate about work-life balance in India.
