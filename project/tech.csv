Kirk Cousins could end Aaron Rodgers' comeback dreams as Steelers move fast to replace their QB gap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/kirk-cousins-could-end-aaron-rodgers-comeback-dreams-as-steelers-move-fast-to-replace-their-qb-gap/articleshow/120749044.cms,"Kirk Cousins could cut Aaron Rodgers down the line and take the job in Pittsburgh (Getty Images)

With Aaron Rodgers undecided, Kirk Cousins emerges as top alternative

The Pittsburgh Steelers are currently facing a pivotal moment in their quarterback strategy, with two high-profile names in the spotlight Aaron Rodgers and Kirk Cousins. The team has reportedly offered Rodgers a one-year deal worth $10 million in hopes of bringing his leadership and experience to Pittsburgh. However, Rodgers, now nearing the twilight of his career, has yet to make a firm decision, potentially weighing retirement or a more favorable opportunity.Aaron Rodgers’ indecision has led the Steelers to look at backup options, and Kirk Cousins has emerged as a serious contender. Cousins, who signed a massive four-year, $180 million contract with the Atlanta Falcons, recently found himself unexpectedly sidelined. The Falcons chose to start rookie quarterback Michael Penix Jr., leaving Cousins' future with the team in doubt. Frustrated by the move, Cousins is now open to joining another team where he can continue as a starter, and the Steelers may offer that chance.Just days ahead of the 2025 NFL Draft, reports from The Athletic’s Dianna Russini suggest that a potential three-team trade is gaining momentum between the Browns, Steelers, and Vikings one that could include veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins. With Cousins openly expressing his desire to move on from the Falcons, Pittsburgh is shaping up to be the most appealing landing spot for him.""It's believed that Cousins would be against any trade that involves sending him to a situation involving a young QB, similar to the situation he faced in Atlanta last year,"" Russini stated, alluding to the entry of rookie Michael Penix Jr., who overtook Cousins for the starting role during the 2024 campaign.Despite his availability, Cousins brings both promise and concern. On the one hand, he offers veteran experience and consistent performance in the regular season. On the other hand, he has a reputation for struggling under pressure, particularly in high-stakes games, and he posted a high number of interceptions in his last season. For the Steelers, who prioritize ball control and limiting turnovers, this could be a significant red flag.Financially, bringing Kirk Cousins to Pittsburgh won’t be easy. His contract is massive, and the Falcons are reportedly seeking a team willing to take on a substantial portion of his salary. This could become a major obstacle unless both teams agree to a restructuring deal. Still, if the Steelers decide that Cousins is the right fit, they may be willing to negotiate.Currently, the Steelers' quarterback depth includes Mason Rudolph, Skylar Thompson, and rookie Will Howard. While all three have potential, none bring the same level of experience or immediate impact that Rodgers or Cousins could offer. The Steelers are clearly looking for a proven starter to elevate their playoff hopes in a competitive AFC.Also Read: Are the Jets setting themselves up for disaster? Ignoring defensive tackles in record-breaking NFL Draft could be a colossal mistake In the end, the decision hinges on Rodgers’ choice. If he declines, the Steelers must weigh whether Cousins is worth the financial and performance risk. Either way, Pittsburgh appears committed to making a bold move at quarterback in 2025.","Pittsburgh Steelers have reportedly offered Aaron Rodgers a one-year deal worth $10 million.

Skylar Diggins clarified her name to the media



Seattle Storm point guard Skylar Diggins has officially dropped her husband's name “Smith” from hers whom she married in 2017, choosing to be publicly known simply as Skylar Diggins moving forward. The WNBA player confirms the change during the team’s media day ahead of the 2025 season, putting an end to the speculations that have been swirling online in recent weeks after the fans began noticing the change in her social media handles.Diggins, who rose to national visibility during her college years at Notre Dame, has long been one of the most recognizable faces in women’s basketball. She tied the knot with former Fighting Irish footballer Daniel Smith in April 2017, the couple has two children together and managed to maintain a relatively private life.Skylar Diggins recently changed her social media handles, removing “Smith” from her name, causing speculations of a drift in the relationship.

Thank you for the question, too, yes, it does say Skylar Diggins, and I would like to be addressed as that moving forward,” she said.While Diggins hasn’t officially offered a detailed explanation for the change, fans were quick to notice that she had not only updated her social media handles and bio but also removed several photos with her husband, Daniel Smith. The move led to plenty of speculation, but no official word about her personal life has been shared.Beyond the headlines about her name, Diggins looked genuinely excited about the upcoming season. The Storm have undergone some major transformations, including the trade of longtime after Jewell Loyd. In return, Seattle secured the No.2 overall pick in the 2025 draft, adding future potential to the team.Diggins mentioned,” This is definitely the most talented roster I’ve been a part of in my 13 years, 11 on the floor,” adding, “Everybody looks really good, the vibes have been really good.”Skylar Diggins enters the 2025 WNBA season ready to turn the page and lead by example both on and off the court.Also Read: “You make us proud” — Giannis Antetokounmpo’s wife Mariah Antetokounmpo poured heartfelt tribute after Milwaukee Bucks’ series loss","Seattle Storm point guard Skylar Diggins has officially dropped her husband's name “Smith’ from hers.

A few selfies, some outfit shots, and then——a shot of her and Sauce Gardner looking real cozy. No fanfare, no heart emojis. Just that soft-launch energy that says, “Yeah, it’s what you think.”It didn’t take long for fans to zero in on the pic. Within minutes, the comments were flooded with reactions.Not everyone’s onboard with Sauce and Ice Spice’s new public status.

Geoffrey Hinton has thrown his weight behind Elon Musk , in his fight to stop ChatGPT-maker OpenAI’s shift from nonprofit to a for-profit structure. The 2024 Nobel Prize winner in Physics, citing risks to its mission of ensuring artificial general intelligence ( AGI ) benefits humanity, wants to stop OpenAI 's move. Musk shared a post on X, amplifying Geoffrey Hinton’s concerns, posting a screenshot of Google search of Hinton, and highlighting that he's a nobel laureate, trying to emphasise on his and the godfather of AI's worry.Hinton’s open letter to the Attorneys General of California and Delaware, urging them to halt OpenAI’s restructuring. Hinton, revered as the “Godfather of AI” for his contributions to artificial neural networks, warned that the shift could prioritize profits over safety, undermining the ethical development of AGI.Hinton, joined by over 30 AI experts and former OpenAI staff, described AGI as “the most important and potentially dangerous technology of our time,” emphasizing the need for robust safety structures. His letter, backed by Encode, criticizes OpenAI for abandoning its original safety-focused nonprofit charter, a move he believes could have catastrophic consequences.Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but later sued the company over its alleged betrayal of its nonprofit roots, has long advocated for truth-seeking AI, as he reiterated at the Breakthrough Prize ceremony in 2024, stressing AI’s need to prioritize curiosity and humanity’s well-being.OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT , announced plans in December 2024 to restructure, reducing its nonprofit arm’s authority to attract significant investments, including $40 billion from Japan’s SoftBank . The company insists it will maintain its mission by converting its for-profit arm into a public-benefit corporation, similar to models used by Anthropic and Musk’s xAI. However, critics, including Hinton and Musk, argue this hybrid structure risks diluting safety oversight at a time when Hinton estimates a 10-20% chance of AI surpassing human control within decades.","OpenAI announced plans in December 2024 to restructure, reducing its nonprofit arm’s authority to attract significant investments.

A long-standing rivalry between Antonio Brown and Ben Roethlisberger: The origins of their bad blood



The feud between former Pittsburgh Steelers stars Antonio Brown and Ben Roethlisberger has been one of the most dramatic in NFL history , but it just got even more bizarre. In a recent twist, Brown dropped a bombshell, claiming that he once hooked up with Roethlisberger’s sister during the 2011 Pro Bowl. This revelation has sent shockwaves through social media, adding fuel to an already intense rivalry. Fans are now wondering: just how deep does this animosity go?In a recent tweet, Antonio Brown claimed that during the 2011 Pro Bowl, he and Roethlisberger’s sister had a one-night fling.Brown stated, leaving fans and media alike reeling.This revelation comes at a time when both players have long since left the Steelers, but their beef seems to have evolved from professional disagreements to something far more personal.The timing of this revelation is also significant while Roethlisberger has retired, Brown’s career has been marred by controversy, with his behavior frequently making headlines. But this latest bombshell may just be his most jaw-dropping move yet.The reaction from fans has been explosive.

Brown has often criticized Roethlisberger, calling out his leadership style and claiming mistreatment during their time together.

The clip, shared widely on X (formerly Twitter), has revived long-debunked conspiracy theories about Obama’s gender.The short clip, posted by conservative commentator Paul Szypula on April 30, shows Obama saying, “That warms my heart, particularly as a Black man.” Szypula captioned it, “Interpret as you wish.” The implication quickly spread, with some users calling it a “slip up.”But a review of the full April 23 episode of IMO With Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson shows the clip was taken completely out of context. Obama was addressing guest Marlon Wayans and referencing his experience as a Black man. She was not speaking about herself.The full sentence, community notes on X clarified, should be read as: “That warms my heart. Particularly as a Black man, would you care to share…”, a question directed at Wayans during a conversation about his transgender child and the experiences of Black men and women in public life.Snopes and other fact-checking organizations have repeatedly debunked the conspiracy that Michelle Obama is transgender.

Written on a Titanic letter card and postmarked in Queenstown and London, it is ominous in tone, with the following ominous words: ""It is a fine ship but I shall await my journey's end before I pass judgment on her.""Auctioneer Henry Aldridge and Son described it as ""a truly exceptional, museum-grade piece,"" saying it is the record price for a Titanic letter. Survivor letters of Gracie's stature are extremely rare, with this one never previously on the market.The four-page letter, written to a family acquaintance who befriended Gracie at the London Waldorf Hotel, is warm in its reminiscence about his earlier crossings on the Oceanic, remembering, ""Her sea-worthy qualities and yacht-like appearance make me miss her,"" while also marveling at the size of the Titanic.Days later, Gracie would be a participant in one of history's most horrific nights. Following an evening of squash, a dip in the ship's pool, and a Sunday church service, Gracie was rudely awakened at 11:40 pm by the abrupt shutdown of Titanic's engines. Without hesitation, he assisted women and children into lifeboats, procuring blankets to protect them from the cold.When the ship finally went down into the Atlantic waves, Gracie crawled onto an upturned collapsible boat with other survivors. In the blackness, frantic swimmers cried out for assistance, but fear of capsizing prevented those on board from taking on more. Gracie remembered with sorrow that over half the men holding on to the upturned boat died before dawn, exhausted and chilled.""In no instance, I am happy to say, did I hear any word of rebuke,"" Gracie wrote in his later memoir, The Truth About the Titanic, recounting the final moments of those left behind, some offering blessings rather than curses.Col. Gracie's eye-witness account is still one of the most detailed and graphic accounts of the tragedy. The auctioneers titled the letter an invaluable relic, ""It is impossible to overstate the rarity of this lot,"" they added. ""Written by one of the most famous survivors, it captures a moment frozen in time.""","Col. Archibald Gracie was one of the Titanic's most distinguished survivors.

TOI Correspondent from London:

Over the years, patrons of Britain’s oldest Indian restaurant, ‘Veeraswamy’, have included Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Charlie Chaplin, Winston Churchill, Marlon Brando, Sharon Stone and David Cameron.A haunt of Indian maharajas and European royalty too, the King of Denmark even shipped out a cask of Carlsberg for staff to store for whenever he dined there.Now the Michelin-starred restaurant , which opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London, and today serves pineapple curry and chicken makhana au vin, is at threat of closure as the Crown Estate (property portfolio owned by King Charles), which owns Victory House, the building in which the restaurant is based, is refusing to renew its lease, which expires in June.The Crown Estate claims it needs to take the restaurant space back to extend the ground floor reception for offices on the building’s upper floors. Knocking through into Veeraswamy would give it an extra 11 sq mts.Veeraswamy’s founder, Edward Palmer, was the great-grandson of General William Palmer, and his wife, Begum Faiz Baksh, a Mughal princess. Gen Palmer was private secretary to Warren Hastings, first governor-general of the Presidency of Fort William. It was acquired by Ranjit Mathrani and Namita Panjabi in 1996.“Had they wanted to, they could’ve easily put the office reception on the first floor. I think they’ve come to the view that it’s too tiresome having a restaurant there, they want it to be all offices,” Mathrani (81), told the Times of London.If the Crown Estate refuses to allow the restaurant to stay put until he finds and fit out an alternative space, with its iconic décor inspired by the art nouveau of the 1920s and maharaja’s palaces, the restaurant will have to close, leading to possible redundancies and loss of business until a new site is found.Mathrani is taking the Crown Estate to court.A spokesperson for The Crown Estate told TOI: “The Crown Estate has a duty to generate value for the nation, while acting as responsible stewards for this historic part of London. We need to carry out a comprehensive refurbishment of Victory House. This includes a major upgrade to the offices and improving the entrance to make it more accessible. Due to the limited options available in this listed building we need to remove the entrance to the restaurant, which means we will not be able to offer Veeraswamy an extension when their lease expires.”","Michelin-starred restaurant Veeraswamy opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

HUID in the hallmarked gold jewellery



Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Ed Sheeran’s old phone uncovers a pop culture time capsule

The long shadow of a VMA moment that changed everything

A quirky throwback from 2015 has unexpectedly reignited the pop culture saga between Taylor Swift and Kanye West. The spark? A handwritten message on a jar of homemade jam that Swift gave to fellow artist Ed Sheeran, now gaining attention after Sheeran shared the image from an old phone he recently recovered.Ed Sheeran, who’s currently battling a copyright lawsuit over his track Thinking Out Loud, recently stumbled upon an old phone and decided to share some of its nostalgic contents on his new Instagram account, @teddysoldphone. Among the throwbacks was a photo of a jam jar with a cheeky message from Swift: ""Yo Ed - I'm really happy 4 you and I'm gonna let you finish but this is the best JAM OF ALL TIME, - T.""This playful nod is, of course, a direct reference to Kanye West’s infamous interruption at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, where he stormed the stage during Swift’s Best Female Video acceptance speech, exclaiming, ""Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, I'mma let you finish. But Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all-time!""While Swift’s jam note is lighthearted and witty, it quickly stirred up deep-rooted memories of her rocky history with West. After their public reconciliation attempts in the years following the VMAs, things soured once again in 2016 when West released Famous, a track containing a controversial lyric about Swift. He claimed she had approved the line, but Swift vehemently denied ever consenting to it.The drama escalated when Kim Kardashian—then West’s wife—released a recording of a phone call between Swift and West, attempting to frame Swift as dishonest. This led to Kardashian dubbing her “a snake” on Twitter with the now-iconic tweet: ""Wait it's legit National Snake Day?!?!? They have holidays for everybody, I mean everything these days!""What seemed like a harmless jar of jam has become a cultural time machine, taking fans back to a defining era in pop music. Swift’s clever callback not only showcases her humor but also highlights how unforgettable the Kanye interruption remains in the collective memory.Also Read: Kayla Nicole throws shade at Travis Kelce as George Kittle becomes NFL’s highest-paid tight end As Taylor Swift continues to dominate headlines—and social media chatter—even her decade-old inside jokes hold the power to reopen old wounds and stir fresh discussions in the ever-evolving saga of celebrity feuds.",Ed Sheeran shared a photo of a jam jar with a message from Taylor Swift.
