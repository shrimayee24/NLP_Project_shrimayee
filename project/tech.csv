However, no official explanation has been provided regarding the cause of the outage or a timeframe for full service restoration. This unexpected downtime has left many gamers unable to access their favorite multiplayer games, cloud saves, and digital content, leading to widespread speculation about whether the issue was caused by maintenance, a technical glitch, or a more significant underlying problem.The outage disrupted essential PlayStation services, preventing users from engaging in various online activities. Many players reported being unable to log into their PSN accounts, access their friends lists, or join multiplayer games. Online-based titles such as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Fortnite, Grand Theft Auto Online, EA FC 24, and Destiny 2 were rendered inaccessible, leaving competitive gamers particularly frustrated.Additionally, players attempting to make purchases on the PlayStation Store encountered difficulties, with transactions failing or the store failing to load entirely. Some users also experienced issues with their cloud saves and game updates, which rely on PlayStation’s online infrastructure to sync data across devices. Error messages such as ""PlayStation Network is currently undergoing maintenance (WS-37432-9)"" appeared frequently, giving users no choice but to either dismiss the message or visit PlayStation’s support page for updates.The PlayStation Network outage was not limited to a specific device, as players on PS5, PS4, PS3, and PS Vita all reported experiencing connectivity issues. The disruption also extended beyond consoles, affecting PlayStation’s web-based services, including PlayStation Direct and the PlayStation mobile app. This meant that users who attempted to manage their accounts, purchase digital content, or check their subscription details were also unable to do so.As the outage impacted regions worldwide, it led to disruptions across multiple time zones, affecting both casual gamers and esports players alike. The inability to access online game modes, leaderboards, and competitive matches added to the frustration, as many gamers rely on PlayStation’s network for their daily entertainment.

What a joke. We can’t even play the games we purchased.”A third user, visibly upset, wrote, “I’m sick and just trying to play, but you always ruin everything. It’s been over eight hours—fix it already!” Another echoed similar concerns, stating, “This is ridiculous—over 12 hours and still no access. What am I even paying for with PS Plus?”The service disruption occurred during peak hours when numerous gamers were logging in after work or school, anticipating access to PlayStation's online features. Players experienced difficulties connecting to their friends lists, navigating account management sections, and completing transactions on the PlayStation Store and PlayStation Direct.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop.We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes the cost of inference will come down which will make it easier for companies to be able to infuse all their applications with inference and with generative AI.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.

Microsoft’s AI-powered “first line of defense against scams” is now available for these users,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsofts-ai-powered-first-line-of-defense-against-scams-is-now-available-for-these-users/articleshow/118029154.cms,"What is a scareware scam

How does Microsoft’s scareware blocker work

Microsoft has started to roll out a new feature in its Edge browser called “scareware blocker” to protect users from increasingly sophisticated online scams, particularly those employing scareware tactics . The company announced the feature at its Ignite conference last November and is now inviting users to preview and test it.Scareware scams employ aggressive web pages designed to deceive users into believing their system is infected with malware.These scams often pressure victims to call fake tech support numbers, potentially leading to financial loss and compromised personal information.Microsoft says that its data revealed a significant rise in online scams, with Edge blocking five times more scams in 2024 compared to just three years prior. While Edge currently utilizes Microsoft Defender SmartScreen to block known scams, the new scareware blocker aims to provide a proactive defense against emerging threats.Microsoft says that its scareware blocker leverages a machine learning model to identify the characteristics of scareware scams and empowers users to regain control of their browsing experience.“Scareware blocker adds a new, first line of defense to help protect the users exposed to a new scam if it attempts to open a full screen page. Scareware blocker uses a machine learning model that runs on the local computer. The model uses computer vision to compare full screen pages to thousands of sample scams that the scam-fighting community shared with us. The model runs locally, without saving or sending images to the cloud,” Microsoft said.Users can then choose to report the malicious site to Microsoft, contributing to the improvement of Defender SmartScreen's ability to detect and block similar scams across the web. Users can also report false positives, helping to refine the scareware blocker's accuracy and reduce the likelihood of legitimate pages being mistakenly blocked.","Microsoft has started to roll out a new feature in its Edge browser called “scareware blocker” The feature aims to protect users from increasingly sophisticated online scams.

“The DeepSeek iOS app globally disables App Transport Security (ATS) which is an iOS platform-level protection that prevents sensitive data from being sent over unencrypted channels. Since this protection is disabled, the app can (and does) send unencrypted data over the internet,”

“While none of this data taken separately is highly risky, the aggregation of many data points over time quickly leads to easily identifying individuals. The recent data breach of Gravy Analytics demonstrates this data is actively being collected at scale and can effectively de-anonymize millions of individuals,”

“The encryption algorithm chosen for this part of the application leverages a known broken encryption algorithm (3DES) which makes it a poor choice to protect the confidentiality of data,”

“[A sample user] is operating on the latest iPad, leveraging a cellular data connection that is registered to FirstNet (American public safety broadband network operator) and ostensibly the user would be considered a high value target for espionage. Bear in mind that not only are 10’s of data points collected in the DeepSeek iOS app but related data is collected from millions of apps and can be easily purchased, combined and then correlated to quickly de-anonymise users,”

The DeepSeek app has been popular among iPhone users since its launch and even topped the App Store charts in the US. However, a mobile security company has discovered multiple new security vulnerabilities in the app offered by the Chinese AI startup. These flaws are considered more severe than a previous security issue that exposed chat history and sensitive data due to a lack of database authentication. However, the company didn’t fully disclose the extent of the new vulnerabilities and their potential impact.The security flaws in DeepSeek’s iPhone app were discovered by the mobile security company NowSecure. One of the vulnerabilities includes the lack of Apple’s built-in App Transport Security (ATS). ATS is meant to protect sensitive personal data by ensuring it is transmitted only over encrypted channels. The company claims to have discovered that DeepSeek had disabled this feature on its iPhone app.NowSecure said in a blog post.The company said that even though the exposed data may seem harmless, it can be easily combined to reveal a user's identity.the company added.NowSecure also noted that even though DeepSeek does encrypt data, it uses an outdated method that is known to have security flaws.the company continued.Moreover, the company also said that the data gathered by DeepSeek’s iPhone app can help identify potential targets for spying.the company explained.",The DeepSeek app has been popular among iPhone users since its launch and even topped the App Store charts in the US.

These channels, available from February 4, 2025, will offer 24/7 streaming of back-to-back episodes, bringing uninterrupted entertainment to Virgin TV subscribers.The channels are part of Virgin Media’s Free Ad-Supported Television (FAST) lineup, which allows users to access content without additional subscription costs.This expansion comes at a time when traditional TV providers are increasing prices, and streaming services are becoming more expensive, making FAST channels an attractive alternative for cost-conscious consumers.Virgin Media customers using Stream, V6, and Virgin TV 360 boxes will be able to access these new channels directly through their TV guide. The move reflects the growing popularity of reality TV and quiz-based content, as well as the increasing demand for free and easily accessible entertainment options.Virgin Media has assigned channel number 233 to Hell’s Kitchen and channel number 253 to Eggheads, making it easy for fans to tune in.The introduction of these dedicated reality TV channels is part of Virgin Media’s broader FAST channel strategy, which aims to provide cost-effective entertainment solutions to viewers. Unlike traditional cable or premium streaming services, FAST channels are delivered over the internet and supported by advertising, making them a free alternative to paid subscriptions.Virgin Media has previously introduced over 30 FAST channels, featuring content from popular shows such as Tipping Point and Deal or No Deal. The integration of these channels into Virgin TV’s program guide makes them more accessible compared to app-based streaming services, where users often need to search for content manually.The launch of new FAST channels coincides with rising television and streaming service costs across the UK.At the same time, traditional broadcasters are losing key channels, as seen with Eurosport’s recent announcement to exit the UK market after 35 years. These factors have driven a shift towards free, ad-supported TV, making FAST channels an increasingly attractive option for budget-conscious viewers.Virgin Media sees the expansion of its FAST channel lineup as a way to provide more value to its customers. David Bouchier, Chief TV and Entertainment Officer at Virgin Media O2, emphasized the growing importance of free streaming content in the current media landscape.""Reality TV doesn’t just entertain us but also tests our knowledge, gives us conversation starters, and most importantly, brings TV fans together,"" Bouchier stated.""The expansion of our streaming channel offering is brilliant news for our customers. With some of the most recognizable reality content available, our viewers can sit back, relax, and enjoy extra value— and extra drama—on us.""The Hell’s Kitchen and Eggheads channels are available to all Virgin Media TV customers with Stream, V6, or Virgin TV 360 set-top boxes. Unlike many streaming services that require separate apps, these channels are integrated directly into Virgin TV’s electronic program guide, making them as easy to access as traditional cable channels.For customers looking to explore more free content options, Virgin Media’s growing FAST channel lineup provides an alternative to costly subscription services, ensuring that viewers have access to quality entertainment without additional fees.","Virgin Media launches dedicated channels for Hell’s Kitchen and Eggheads.
