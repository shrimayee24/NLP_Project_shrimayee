A notable highlight from the trial was a stability demonstration in which glasses filled with water remained perfectly balanced without any water spilling even at over 180 kmph speed.“Vande Bharat Sleeper tested today by Commissioner ailway Safety. It ran at 180 kmph between Kota Nagda section. And our own water test demonstrated the technological features of this new generation train,” Ashwini Vaishnaw wrote in his post on X.Designed for overnight and long-haul journeys, the Vande Bharat sleeper train is the sleeping-class counterpart of the Vande Bharat chair car services already operating across the country.At present, two prototype rakes of the Vande Bharat sleeper train have been produced by BEML. Indian Railways is also gearing up for a broader transformation of long-distance travel, with plans to roll out more than 200 such sleeper trains in the coming years, supported by several ongoing manufacturing initiatives.BEML is jointly producing 10 Vande Bharat sleeper train sets in partnership with the Integral Coach Factory. Another batch of 10 sleeper rakes is being built by Kinet, a joint venture involving Indian and Russian entities. In addition, a consortium led by Titagarh Rail Systems along with BHEL has secured an order to manufacture 80 sleeper-class trainsets. Separately, the Integral Coach Factory is also developing its own sleeper configuration of the Vande Bharat train as an internal project.","The first Vande Bharat sleeper train will run between Guwahati and Kolkata.

NEW DELHI: Soon all private vehicles like cars and bikes will have to get their fitness and pollution tests done at automated test stations (ATS) for renewal of registration as it is in the case of commercial vehicles. The ATS or the inspecting officer will also need to upload at least a 10 seconds geotagged video of the vehicle at the time of fitness test before issuing any certificate.The road transport ministry has proposed key changes in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, including this, through a draft notification to prevent the malpractice of vehicle owners managing to get fitness certificates even without visiting ATS or other testing centres. This also gains significance in the light of increasing concern over air pollution and fitness of vehicles.Fitness certificate is mandatory for renewal of registration of private vehicles after attaining 15 years, and subsequently, in every five years.As per the draft notification, private vehicles, like commercial ones, will need to visit ATS, where these are established, for fitness tests. At present, there are over 160 ATS operational across the country.To ensure that the certificates are issued after carrying out genuine tests, the draft notification says that “the renewal of a certificate of fitness shall be made only after uploading at least a 10 seconds geotagged video of the vehicle at the time of fitness test, capturing the vehicle from front, rear, right side and left side ensuring clear visibility of the registration number plate, chassis number, engine number and features of the vehicle” by an authorised testing station or inspecting officer after carrying out the specified tests.In a bid to avoid vehicle owners using legal provisions to apply for multiple re-tests after vehicles fail to pass the fitness test, the proposed norms say that if a vehicle is not declared as ‘fit’ within 180 days from the first date of vehicle declared as ‘unfit’ the vehicle shall be categorised as ‘End of Life Vehicle (ELV)’ and flagged in the Vahan database as ‘ELV’.Officials said till now people used to get the timeline extended by simply submitting fees just days before the expiry of 180 days. “That won’t be possible any more. They need to get the fitness certificate within 180 days from the day the first test found the vehicle as unfit. Enough safeguards have been put in place to ensure that any ATS doesn’t give incorrect test result,” said an official.",The road transport ministry has proposed key changes in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules.

Ex-Rockstar developer has a GTA 6 warning: ‘If the game is delayed again…',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/ex-rockstar-developer-has-a-gta-6-warning-if-the-game-is-delayed-again/articleshow/126189019.cms,"Former Rockstar developer Mike York warns that further delays to Grand Theft Auto 6 could significantly diminish public interest. He believes Rockstar is prioritizing polish to meet high expectations, but prolonged waits risk alienating fans. York anticipates a November 2026 release, citing it as an optimal period for sales.

“We’ve been waiting so long for

GTA 6

already that if there was to be another delay, people will probably stop caring about its release even more. If

Rockstar

Games delay GTA 6 again then the hype around the game will die down almost completely. Right now, nobody is searching for GTA 6. Everyone knows there’s no news, there’s nothing to talk about… There’s a point to where you delay something so much that you start to make people angry.”

“People aren’t itching to find new details or a latest leak anymore, they’re over it. They are thinking, ‘it will come out when it comes out’, as they’re so burnt out from thinking it will come out soon and then it doesn’t… And then they’re like, ‘OK, whatever…’”

Why Ex-Rockstar developer thinks Rockstar has been delaying the game

“If I know Rockstar Games, and I know the guys over there, one of the reasons for the delay in releasing GTA 6 is because they’re trying to make it look as best as it can possibly be. They’re polishing stuff.

I don’t think they’re completely finished with the game, given how much is on the line and how big everyone’s expectations are for it.”

“I think the game will be released in November 2026 as it’s a good time for the game to come out for Rockstar for multiple reasons to sell video games. If you want to sell a big amount of video games then that’s the perfect time for GTA 6 to come out with it being a month before Christmas. Usually companies only delay these things once or twice when they need to, so I think it will come out around that time,”





Former Rockstar Games developer Mike York has a critical warning for the Take-Two-owned gaming studio. He has warned that the hype and public interest around Grand Theft Auto 6 will “die down” almost completely if the game faces any more delays. In an interview with Esports Insider (as seen by Dexerto), York said:York cited fan reactions showing growing frustration, with some saying they “don’t even care anymore” because repeated delays keep letting them down.he added.The game’s delay from May to November 2026 even caused anger in Poland’s parliament, with an opposition lawmaker calling the postponement “a huge scandal” during a session.Explaining Rockstar’s reason behind GTA 6 delay, York said:York believes Rockstar is aiming to meet very high internal standards and may not feel it has reached that level yet.York noted.Till date, Rockstar has released two official trailers of the highly anticiapted game which have confirmed that GTA 6 is set in a modern Vice City. The game will feature dual protagonists, deeper RPG systems, realistic physics, new heist tools and a more evolving open world.Rockstar has not announced the official price for India. However, early industry estimates suggest the standard edition may be priced around ₹9,000, which is much higher than GTA V’s console launch price of ₹3,499.","Former Rockstar Games developer Mike York has a critical warning for the Take- Two-owned gaming studio.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu was recently asked by an X (formerly Twitter) user why there is no talk about Arattai now?

Alexandr Wang is reportedly clashing with Meta’s old guard

Meta’s Secret AI Army: Top Talent Hired from OpenAI, Google & More

Alexandr Wang memo on Meta's massive AI restructure





In June this year, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms agreed to take a 49% stake in artificial intelligence (AI) startup Scale AI for $14.8 billion. As part of the deal, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang took top position inside Meta, leading the company's new “superintelligence” lab, , Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL. The 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, Wang has been installed as the public face of Zuckerberg’s AI reboot. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board. However, it reportedly seems that all is not well between the AI wunderkind and his Boss, Mark Zuckerberg. The 41-year-old Zuckerberg is said to have backed his new hires with nine-figure compensation packages to lure top researchers from rivals, igniting a Silicon Valley poaching war.According to a report in Financial Times, Wang privately believes that CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s micromanagement of the company’s AI push is ""suffocating"". Wang is said to have complained to associates that Zuckerberg’s tight grip on the effort is stifling progress, the report said, citing multiple people familiar with the situation. Report adds that cracks have begun to emerge at an executive level and that tensions have been bubbling between Wang and Zuckerberg for sometime now.As per the report, internally, some staff question whether Wang is out of his depth, given his lack of experience managing teams in a large corporation but also his expertise in AI data services rather than as an AI researcher pushing technical breakthroughs.Incidentally, Alexander Wang’s arrival at Meta has created friction over the company's fundamental approach to AI development, with his superintelligence team pushing to make the company’s next model “closed” — keeping its technology secret. This is said to mark a major departure from Meta’s longtime philosophy of open-sourcing its models for other developers to build upon, causing some old guard members to chafe at the change, the Times reported.The new leadership has chosen to abandon Meta’s previous frontier model called Behemoth, which saw its release delayed last spring after disappointing performance tests. Meta’s AI division faces a dramatic four-way split as Meta reorganizes into groups focused on research, superintelligence development, products, and infrastructure, according to the report.As the new vision and leadership have crystallised, some top names have left. Among them, in recent weeks, Meta’s longtime chief legal officer Jennifer Newstead was poached by arch-rival Apple, while chief revenue officer John Hegeman announced he too was leaving to launch a start-up.Similarly, chief AI scientist and Turing Award winner Yann LeCun is departing Meta to launch a new AI initiative. He had reportedly taken exception at having to report to Wang. Another reason cited for his resignation is that his longer-term research was reportedly hit hard by the recent cuts announced at Meta.Meta reorganized its AI teams in June this year. The memo said that most team leaders will report directly to 28-year-old Wang. This included investor and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who heads MSL's product team and was announced as an MSL leader alongside Wang in June. In the email sent to employees, Wang wrote that ""superintelligence is coming,"" and to ""take it seriously,"" Meta needs to make major changes. This includes establishing four distinct teams that focus on research, training, products, and infrastructure.The reorganisation is the latest in a series of AI reorgs for Meta. Incidentally, Meta had already dissolved two major AI teams in the past six months.","Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board.

Meta AI chief Alexandr Wang says will have kids only after Elon Musk’s Neuralink …,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-ai-chief-alexandr-wang-says-will-have-kids-only-after-elon-musks-neuralink-/articleshow/126263932.cms,"Here’s what Alexandr Wang said about Elon Musk's Neuralink

“Billionaire Alexandr Wang says he wants to wait to have kids until Neuralink is very advanced, because children’s brains in the first seven years are more flexible and can learn brain-computer interfaces, unlocking more potential than adult brains

Speaking on a podcast, Wang explained that he wants to wait until Neuralink or similar BCI technology is reliable and widely available. His reasoning is that children born into such a world could integrate the technology directly into their developing brains, rather than having to adapt to it later in life

He pointed to neuroplasticity, the brain’s heightened ability to form neural connections in early childhood, arguing that during the first ~7 years, children could learn to use brain-computer interfaces in ways adults simply cannot

At a deeper level, Wang’s comments reflect a broader concern: artificial intelligence is advancing at an exponential pace, while human biological evolution is slow. He suggests that direct neural links to AI may eventually be necessary for humans to remain cognitively competitive in a future shaped by superintelligence.”

“It's never an easy decision to say goodbye to colleagues. These are talented people who have worked extremely hard and contributed to our Al effort. Anyone in North America whose role was impacted has already been notified. Those who may be impacted in EMEA have been notified and remain subject to consultation,” Wang said.

“This by no means signals any decrease in investment. In fact, we will continue to hire industry-leading Al-native talent. Our goal is to enable MSL to move faster. We remain excited about the models we are training, our ambitious compute plans, and the products we are building, and I'm confident in our path to superintelligence,” he added.





Alexandr Wang, the head of Meta’s artificial intelligence division — SuperIntelligence Labs has now gave a new statement on his plans of having kids. Speaking at The Shawn Rayan Show, Wang said that he wait until Elon Musk ’s Neuralink or similar brain‑computer interface (BCI) technology is highly advanced before having children. Wang is of the opinion that child neuroplasticity offers the best window for adopting brain‑computer interfaces, and that future generations could grow up learning to use superintelligence tools intuitively. “I’ll have kids after Neuralink is very advanced, because children’s brains in the first seven years are more flexible and can learn brain-computer interfaces, unlocking more potential than adult brains,” said Wang.Tesla CEO Elon Musk founded Neuralink is presently conducting clinical trials and is working at restoring mobility for patients with paralysis. Musk has long promoted the idea of expanding the technology to enhance human cognition. Wang’s remarks highlight how some tech leaders see BCIs not just as medical tools, but as essential upgrades for future generations.Meta Superintelligence Lab (MSL), the billion-dollar team that Mark Zuckerberg created to take on Google and OpenAI in artificial intelligence (AI), is hiring. Alexandr Wang, the head of the team and Chief AI officer of Meta, has announced that the company is hiring for its team in Singapore. This comes hours after the social media giant acquired Manus AI, a Singapore-based company working on AI agents.“MSL is hiring in Singapore! We already have some amazing researchers and engineers there, buoyed now by the 100-strong Manus team, and we’re growing fast,” Wang said in a post on X (formerly Twitter). “Feel free to DM with a resumé if interested!,” he added.In the memo, Alexandr Wang writes:","Alexandr Wang, the head of Meta’s artificial intelligence division — SuperIntelligence Labs has now gave a new statement on his plans of having kids.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Coup In Britain? Starmer’s ‘Own Cabinet Plots’ His Downfall | ‘Full Bunker Mode’ In No. 10





The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true. ""The UK is set to introduce a nationwide curfew, beginning at 11pm each night,"" he appears to say on one of thousands of TikTok videos of him posted in last six months. ""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok. By Dec 19, most appeared to have been removed from the platform. Howard said the use of AI in politics is increasing rapidly. ""We know it's internationally pervasive now,"" he said. ""Four of every five elections around the world now have AI-generated political junk that is unattributed and clearly misleading.

Dubai is set to reclaim its crown for the world’s most dazzling New Year’s Eve celebration. The centerpiece, as always, is the Burj Khalifa, where Emaar has planned a record-breaking fusion of pyrotechnics, LED light displays, and synchronized fountain shows. This year, the ""Brightest Show on Earth"" will feature a new laser choreography designed to be visible from miles away.Dubai’s New Year’s Eve fireworks display is set to be one of the most spectacular globally, with the Burj Khalifa and Downtown Dubai as the centerpiece. Fireworks will light up the skyline starting at midnight, with a staggering 48 fireworks displays across 40 approved locations. While the Burj Khalifa remains the ""Main Event"" with its record-breaking laser and pyrotechnic show titled, there are plenty of other world-class spots to ring in the New Year.Getting into central Downtown Dubai requires a tactical plan as the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) implements a massive, phased closure strategy. To keep the city moving, authorities will begin shutting down major road arteries as early as 4:00 PM on December 31..The RTA strongly advises residents and tourists to reach their destinations before 4:00 PM. Once a road is closed, it will remain closed until well after the fireworks end, usually until 2:00 AM or 3:00 AM on January 1, to allow for the safe dispersal of millions of spectators.If you are planning to head to the Burj Khalifa area, the Dubai Metro is your best friend, but it comes with specific rules. The Burj Khalifa/Dubai Mall Metro Station is expected to close or become ""exit-only"" as early as 5:00 PM to prevent overcrowding on the platforms. If you arrive after this time, you will likely be redirected to the Financial Centre or Business Bay stations.To bridge the gap, the RTA is deploying a fleet of over 200 ""shuttle buses"" that will transport visitors from remote parking lots (like Al Wasl and Al Jafiliya) to the Downtown area for free. Taxis will be in high demand, and ""Dubai Taxi"" and Uber/Careem will have designated pick-up zones, though wait times can exceed two hours after the clock strikes twelve. Using a Nol card with a balance of at least AED 20 is essential to avoid long queues at ticket machines.","Dubai is set to reclaim its crown for the world’s most dazzling New Year's Eve celebration.

The founder responds







Indian-origin startup founders are facing a hard time with their companies right now. From being blackmailed to being defamed, anything is up for grabs when it comes to them. Recently, a 16-year-old Indian-origin founder has called out a customer for bullying and threatening to 'destroy' his startup over what he claims is a misunderstanding.Om Patel, a Canada-based entrepreneur shared that the customer began threatening him after facing a login issue, even though it was fixed immediately. Patel, is the founder of BigIdeasDB. In a September 2025 interview with Indieniche, he described his startup as “a platform that helps entrepreneurs and founders discover validated startup ideas by analysing real user complaints from G2 reviews, App Store reviews, and Reddit threads. ”It was during the COVID pandemic, that Patel began to learn coding at the age of 12. He launched his startup in early 2024 and since then, it has generated over CAD$23,000 in revenue.Earlier this week, a customer named Adam emailed Patel and called his product a scam. He demanded an immediate refund, failing which he threatened to post negative feedback about the company on “every Hackernews article and Reddit post”.“Hi, as you know, this product is clearly a scam. The content is fake, the login does not work (redirects to localhost), and the platform is broken. Either refund immediately or I will:Adam's email was sent at 9:45 pm and within four minutes Patel responded saying an update had been pushed which would fix the problem in under 30 minutes. “Somehow, a pull request was merged into main with a redirect to localhost (that's why you weren't able to get in) after the Stripe Webhook was created,” he explained.“I can assure you this product is NOT a scam, just a simple misunderstanding and that's 100% on our part,” he added. Adam however, did not buy the explanation and pushed on his demand for a refund.Thus, Patel took the matter to X. He shared the screenshots of their exchange and accused Adam of trying to ""destroy"" his startup and reputation. He claimed the customer continued with his threats even after the refund was processed.He explained that Adam purchased a subscription to his product but found a login issue within minutes. “I offered a full refund immediately. No questions asked. Problem solved, right? Wrong. Even AFTER processing his refund, he continued with threats and hostile messages.”Additionally, he also accused the customer of bullying him because of his age. ""Some people think they can bully you because of your age. Imagine being so entitled that a 30-second technical glitch makes you try to destroy a 16-year-old's entire future,"" he wrote at the end of the post.The netizens rallied behind the founder, advising him to move on and continue improving his startup.","Om Patel, a 16-year-old Indian-origin founder has called out a customer for bullying and threatening to 'destroy' his startup over what he claims is a misunderstanding.

Ask Dhirendra: 'How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/mutual-funds/ask-dhirendra-how-do-i-decide-how-much-to-save-and-invest-when-my-income-is-just-about-enough/articleshow/126072787.cms,"The problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

If you have any queries for Dhirendra Kumar you can drop us an email at: toi.business@timesinternet.in

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

Apple may skip iPhone 18 launch in 2026: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-may-skip-iphone-18-launch-in-2026-report/articleshow/126298730.cms,"Why iPhone 18 may not launch in 2026





Apple iPhone 18 standard model may not launch this year, says a new report by MacRumours. Other models under the iPhone 18 series – iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max are likely to have the usual launch timeline and are expected to come in September 2026. As per the report, the Cupertino-based company may unveil its first foldable ‌iPhone‌ during the fall event.“For more than a decade, Apple has introduced its mainline ‌iPhone‌ lineup in the fall, with all core models launching simultaneously in September,” MacRumors reported. “That pattern is expected to change this year, when the company is widely rumored to split its upcoming ‌iPhone‌ releases across two distinct release windows rather than unveiling the entire lineup at once. Under this strategy, Apple is expected to prioritize higher-end models in the fall while delaying lower-cost or standard models until the following year,” the report says.According to the report, iPhone 18 may not arrive until the spring of 2027, leaving the ‌iPhone 17‌ “as the latest standard model for over 18 months.” To recall, iPhone 17 debuted in September 2025 along with other iPhone 17 series models. “This would mark the first time Apple skips an entire calendar year without releasing a new generation of its flagship non-Pro ‌iPhone‌,” it says.MacRumours says that the rumoured change is likely due to Apple’s expanding iPhone lineup. Apple introduced iPhone 16e and iPhone Air last year. The company is rumoured to bring its first foldable iPhone in 2026. With the continued presence of iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, there could be at least eight iPhone models on sale by the end of 2026 (considering Apple’s next iPhone lineup continues to include – iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max and iPhone 18).“A staggered release schedule would allow the company to further differentiate its models, give them a longer sales window without internal competition, and spread ‌iPhone‌ launches more evenly across the year,” the report says.According to supply chain analysts, the rumoured shift will also result in manufacturing and logistics benefits for the iPhone maker. “By spacing out launches, Apple could reduce production bottlenecks, better manage component supply for advanced technologies, and smooth revenue recognition across fiscal quarters rather than concentrating ‌iPhone‌ sales in a single period,” the report adds.","Apple iPhone 18 standard model may not launch this year, says a new report by MacRumours.

What hackers said about attacking ESA systems





The European Space Agency (ESA) has confirmed a cyberattack on some of its systems after a hacker offered to sell data allegedly stolen from the organisation. The agency's forensic investigation has revealed that servers located outside the ESA corporate network have been compromised. According to ESA, only a very small number of external servers may have been impacted.The compromised servers support unclassified collaborative engineering activities within the scientific community, the agency stated in a post on microblogging site X (formerly Twitter). ESA is conducting a forensic investigation and working to secure the compromised devices. All relevant stakeholders have been informed. The agency said it will provide further updates as soon as additional information becomes available from the ongoing investigation.In the X post, ESA wrote:“ESA is aware of a recent cybersecurity issue involving servers located outside the ESA corporate network. We have initiated a forensic security analysis—currently in progress—and implemented measures to secure any potentially affected devices.Our analysis so far indicates that only a very small number of external servers may have been impacted.These servers support unclassified collaborative engineering activities within the scientific community. All relevant stakeholders have been informed, and we will provide further updates as soon as additional information becomes available.”ESA's statement came after a hacker using the username '888' posted on BreachForums (a website where cybercriminals gather), claiming they broke into ESA's computer systems last month.The hacker is trying to sell 200 GB of data, a massive amount, which they say was stolen from ESA. This includes files from private online storage spaces where ESA keeps computer code.The hacker claimed they obtained source code (the instructions that make computer programs work), digital keys that grant access to systems, setup files, passwords and usernames, and secret documents.To prove their claims are real, the hacker even shared several screenshots showing some of the stolen information publicly online.","The European Space Agency has confirmed a cyberattack on some of its systems.

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason

What Raymond Chen said about Microsoft making customers talk to Bill Gates

A colleague of mine who used to work in product support told me that they had a procedure if a customer became irate and demanded to speak with Bill Gates. (This was, of course, back in the days when Bill Gates still ran the company.)

The product support technician would apologise for not resolving the problem to the customer’s satisfaction, but if the customer continued to demand to speak with The Boss, the technician would indeed transfer the customer.

The customer was transferred to a special internal phone number, and when the operators saw a call on that line, they took the call and said, “Bill Gates’s office.” They weren’t actually in Bill Gates’s office. They were just pretending to be Bill Gates’s secretary. Their job was to tell the caller that Mr. Gates is currently unavailable, but if the customer leaves a message and their contact information, they will pass the information to Mr.

Gates.

Of course, I assume¹ the information was never actually passed along to Bill. The information went back into the product support channel with a note that the customer was escalated to “Bill Gates’s office.” The technician who returned the call would probably say something like “Bill Gates asked me to contact you to follow up on an issue you had earlier.”

¹ Maybe Bill got a copy or a summary of these messages, I don’t know.”

In hisblog, veteran Microsoft engineer Raymond Chen shared the insider procedure that product support staff used to handle such situations while keeping customers satisfied.He said when a customer (typically a high-value one) became angry enough during a support call to demand speaking with Gates, staff followed a specific protocol.

Apple's Secret 3-Year Plan: A New iPhone Era is Coming!

iPhone Fold expected design and features



iPhone Fold expected price







Apple is expected to launch its first foldable smartphone next year. Now, the long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders offering a clear look at the design of first foldable iPhone. As per the YouTube channel Front Page Tech and popular tipper Ice Universe, the design of Apple’s first foldable iPhone may resemble to Google’s Pixel Fold. As per the images leaked online, the yet-to-launch foldable iPhone is said to feature a book-style foldable design.As per the leaks, the upcoming foldable iPhone is said to feature a large internal display and a smaller cover screen. The renders also highlight a minimal crease along with fold area where rival devices like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold have often drawn criticism. The design appears to prioritize durability and a seamless viewing experience, aligning with Apple’s reputation for premium hardware aesthetics.“The comparison of the design of the Samsung Galaxy Wide Fold and the Apple iPhone Fold is almost identical, with the only difference being the R-angle. Samsung is more square, while Apple is more rounded. Do you prefer the square one or the rounder one?,” wrote Ice Universe.Early leaks suggest that the first foldable iPhone may look and function differently from the current iPhone lineup. It is expected that the foldable iPhone may ditch the Face ID in order to accommodate the thinner foldable design. It is also said that the company may include a 24MP under-display selfie camera which will offer a cleaner and uninterrupted look to the display. The is also tipped that the foldable iPhone may feature another 24MP camera on the cover display making it easier for the users to take selfies or answer video calls.On the back, the foldable iPhone may feature a dual-lens setup with two 48MP sensors — one standard and one ultrawide — but no telephoto lens. This simplified camera system seems to be a design trade-off to maintain the slim build that a foldable phone requires.

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Mustafa Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.Suleyman also warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Google’s Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ In the same interview, he outlined his approach to ‘humanist superintelligence’ Microsoft will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126036637,imgsize-27400,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman.jpg"
