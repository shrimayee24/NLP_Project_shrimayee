Travis Kelce ’s woodland look is packed with subtle symbolism

A fashionable wink to a love that’s front and center in her music

Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce has once again proven that his game-day looks aren’t just about fashion, they’re about affection. The 36-year-old tight end turned heads on Monday, Oct. 6, when he arrived in Jacksonville, Florida, wearing an earthy-toned outfit that seemed to nod directly to “Wood,” one of the cheekiest and most talked-about tracks from his fiancée Taylor Swift ’s new album, The Life of a Showgirl.Travis Kelce stepped off his private jet wearing a $2,650 shirt from luxury brand J. Logan Home, a handmade piece crafted from vintage scarves featuring a woodland design of sticks, feathers, leaves, and ducks. The muted brown and green palette, paired with suede boots, a tan jacket, and a matching hat, gave him a rugged yet refined aesthetic. Fans quickly connected the outfit to Swift’s new track “Wood,” a sultry and innuendo-filled song that many believe was written about him.To complete the look, Kelce carried a suede and leather duffle bag adorned with a “Just for a Moment” Hunter Orange hat, a shade that fits perfectly within The Life of a Showgirl’s signature orange aesthetic.The color itself holds special meaning for Swift, who told Travis and his brother Jason on their New Heights podcast, “It feels like energetically how my life has felt — and this album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during [The Eras Tour], which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant.”While Swift’s album has already broken streaming records, “Wood” has stood out for its bold lyrics and clear references to Kelce. “Forgive me, it sounds cocky / He ah-matized me and opened my eyes,” Swift sings, before delivering the eyebrow-raising line, “Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see / His love was the key that opened my thighs.”Also Read: “That is dangerous”: Taylor Swift reveals why she turned down the Super Bowl halftime show and why it’s not about Travis Kelce Whether by coincidence or careful coordination, Kelce’s look felt like a fashionable inside joke, a wearable love letter that tied his signature confidence with Swift’s artistic boldness. As the Chiefs faced the Jaguars, Kelce once again proved that his pregame walk-ins are as much about heart as they are about style.","Travis Kelce’s woodland look is packed with subtle symbolism.

At just 30 years old, Lucy Guo has joined the ranks of billionaire college dropouts like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, amassing a $1.25 billion net worth, according to Forbes. Guo’s meteoric rise came after her first company, Scale AI, was acquired by Meta in a deal valuing the AI data labeling firm at $29 billion, CNBC reported. Guo, now the founder of Passes, a content creator monetization platform launched in 2022, shared with 'CNBC Make It' that she veered from the traditional path of higher education. After studying computer science and human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University, Guo left the program just two years in, with only one year and eight classes left to graduate. The decision stunned her Chinese immigrant parents.“They sacrificed everything to immigrate from China to America to give their kids a better future,” Guo told CNBC Make It. “For their kids to suddenly let go of their education when they were almost done was like a slap in the face.” “I think they [parents] viewed that as a sign that I didn’t love them, and they weren’t very happy with it, when it was just me making a bet on myself and choosing to optimize for what I thought would be a better future for myself,” she said.Instead of finishing her degree, Guo pursued the Thiel Fellowship, a program by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel that awards $200,000 to young entrepreneurs to build innovative companies. “I think [my parents] viewed that as a sign that I didn’t love them,” Guo said. “It was just me making a bet on myself and choosing to optimize for what I thought would be a better future.” Despite her unconventional path, Guo sees value in college for its networking opportunities.“One to two years in college is actually just incredibly great because you’re going to make the best friends in college, and you’re going to meet the smartest people,” she told CNBC Make It. “There’s no other scenario where there’s such a high concentration of smart people who are also looking to make friends.”Guo noted that unlike workplaces or social events, where people may already have established circles, college offers a unique environment for building lifelong connections. Her story underscores a growing trend of entrepreneurs prioritizing real-world experience over traditional education, while still recognizing the social benefits of a campus environment.","Lucy Guo is the founder of Passes, a content creator monetization platform.

Apple CEO Tim Cook shares post on Steve Jobs' death anniversary; Elon Musk reacts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-ceo-tim-cook-shares-twitter-post-on-steve-jobs-death-anniversary-elon-musk-reacts/articleshow/124322484.cms,"When Steve Jobs refused Tim Cook’s offer of liver transplant





Apple CEO Tim Cook paid a heartfelt tribute to Steve Jobs on his death anniversary. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Cook wrote: “Steve saw the future as a bright and boundless place, lit the path forward, and inspired us to follow. We miss you, my friend.” For those unaware, Jobs died on October 5, 2011 after 8 eight years of battling pancreatic cancer. Tim Cook’s post caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk who reposted it on his timeline.Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in 1976 alongside Steve Wozniak. During his leadership, Apple launched groundbreaking products like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, reshaping entire industries and redefining the way people communicate, work, and consume entertainment.Renowned for his focus on design and user experience, Jobs was instrumental in making technology simpler and more accessible. His vision not only revived Apple from the brink of collapse but also propelled it into becoming one of the most valuable and influential companies in the world.When Steve Jobs was battling severe health issues in the late 2000s, Apple’s then–Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook made a deeply personal gesture.Cook offered to donate a part of his liver to Jobs, since both shared the same rare blood type.According to accounts later revealed in Tim Cook’s biography and media reports, the Apple executive underwent extensive medical testing and found that he was indeed a suitable donor. However, Jobs firmly declined the offer.Cook recalled that Jobs became emotional but quickly dismissed the idea, telling him: “I’ll never let you do that. I’ll never do that.” Jobs, who was known for his uncompromising principles and independent spirit, made it clear he would not accept such a sacrifice from a colleague and friend.This episode highlighted both Cook’s deep loyalty to Jobs and the unique bond the two shared during Apple’s most transformative years. While Jobs continued to struggle with his health, he refused to let anyone else bear the risks of a major procedure on his behalf.Jobs eventually underwent a liver transplant in 2009, performed by a medical team in Tennessee, but not with Cook as a donor. He returned to lead Apple after the surgery, but his health continued to decline until his passing in October 2011.","Apple CEO Tim Cook paid a heartfelt tribute to Steve Jobs on his death anniversary.

Full text of Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu’s post

Arattai is on the surface a simple product but it has a lot of depth inside.

Let me list the engineering frameworks (all homegrown) that power Arattai.

First is what we call our messaging/AV framework. This has been the ""real time"" workhorse of Zoho for a while and this is what offers you those crisp calls and meetings that connect quickly. It has been perfected for 15 years.

Then we have a distributed framework that allows us to distribute the workload among many servers and databases, and provides fault tolerance, performance monitoring, security and so on. This is the backbone of Zoho and powers a lot of what you see on the surface and also keeps our systems secure. We have been perfecting this for over 20 years now!

We have teams actively working on these frameworks and they provide strong support to the Arattai team.

Our staying power comes from the depth of all the R&D we do. Recently I have moved full time to R&D and you will see many more innovations from us.





Zoho founder and former CEO Sridhar Vembu recently said that being a dedicated engineer is like being a Rishi. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Vembu highlighted that the company’s recently launched messaging platform – Arattai may see a “simple product” on the surface, but “has a lot of depth inside”. Praising the Arattai team, he wrote “all of you have worked hard for over 5 years without expecting that the product would ever take off.” “Allow neither praise nor criticism nor fame to distract you, resolutely stay the course,” Vembu added.In the post, he also shed light on the engineering framework that power Arattai.

“My philosophy here is pretty simple. I want to define what is important in my life. I don't want other people or companies, all kinds of organisations, telling me what is important today and what I should be thinking about.”

“the more connected and accessible you are, the less productive you are.”





Telegram CEO Pavel Durov begins his day without checking his phone. This is because he views the device as a distraction that can prevent people from forming their own ideas. On a recent episode of the Lex Fridman podcast, Durov said he tries to limit his phone usage, explaining that he doesn't want other people telling him what to think. Durov's discipline regarding his phone is part of a broader routine aimed at maximising mental clarity. He revealed that he allocates 11 to 12 hours for sleep, often spending part of that time with his mind racing, as he finds that brilliant ideas come to him during these extended rest periods. Fridman, the podcast host, also noted that he spent two weeks with Durov and never saw him use his phone for social media as most people do.In the podcast, Durov said:However, Durov acknowledged the need to stay connected while maintaining balance, as his career has been built on apps that promote smartphone use. He noted:Durov has also been vocal about his views on technology and data privacy.In August, he said he’d “rather die” than give third parties access to Telegram messages.He has become a central figure in the ongoing tension between social media platforms and governments. In August 2024, he was arrested by French authorities over allegations that Telegram enabled illegal activity, claims that he has firmly denied.

I built my career by sensing and riding successive technological waves. I started my career in the PC and client server era and pivoted quickly when the internet boom came. Being a technologist means recognising paradigm shifts early on and aligning one’s work to them.Overcoming early career barriers: Like many women in tech, I faced moments of self-doubt and the challenge of being a minority in my field. Mid-career, I encountered setbacks that tested my confidence. My response was to commit to reinventing myself. I learned to silence my inner critic and embraced support from my mentors and peers, believing it often takes a village to succeed. It required resilience and grit to transform obstacles into learning experiences, emerging stronger and more self-reliant.Innovating in the internet era: In the early internet era, I pushed myself to innovate. I had the chance to help expand Microsoft’s SQL Server onto early mobile devices, allowing businesses to synchronise data to smartphones long before app stores existed. That leap – essentially speculating where the puck was headed – paid off and taught me the value of foresight in a rapidly changing landscape.Leading in the cloud revolution: As I stepped into bigger leadership roles, I led teams that made disaster recovery much more affordable.Azure Site Recovery became one of the first disaster recovery-as-a-service offerings, eventually earning recognition. These wins came from staying customer-focused and balancing short-term results with long-term bets.Reinventing leadership for an AI future: Now, in the age of AI and ambient intelligence, I continue to reinvent myself. My journey has taught me the importance of continuous learning and having courage to evolve. I urge women in tech to be bold and manufacture their own success through focus and perseverance.Climbing the career ladder is not one big leap but a series of intentional steps. As Amelia Earhart said, “Some of us have great runways already built for us. If you have one, take off. But if you do not, grab a shovel and build one for yourself and those who will follow.”Collective growth and shared success: In the spirit of Ubuntu, “I am because we are,” true progress is not a solo journey. It is about moving forward together, recognising that our individual success is deeply intertwined with the success of our team. When we align our goals, support one another, and share in both challenges and victories, we create a culture where everyone thrives.",Being a technologist means recognising paradigm shifts early on and aligning one’s work to them.

AI is expected to help improve production life cycle times, quality, and efficiency.“Earlier, data, the raw material for AI, was not available in a usable form. Now, with real-time data, AI kicks in to improve operations,” says JS Gujral, managing director of Syrma SGS Technology.EMS companies have long used automation and robotics to improve operations and handle repetitive tasks like welding and on assembly lines. Now, thanks to sensors on every device generating millions of data points, AI is coming in to also make factories 'intelligent’.“AI is needed to separate the good from the bad,” says Vinod Sharma, MD of Noida-based Deki Electronics, one of the largest capacitor manufacturers in the country. He adds: “When the scale was small, say 100,000 units a day, you could do with automation. But now, as manufacturing scales up to like 1 million parts per day, that needs intelligence in factory operations.”Surface-mounttechnology (SMT) machines that place components on circuit boards have been used for decades. Now, Josh Foulger, president of Zetwerk Electronics, says computer vision models can detect whether a chip has been placed correctly or if solder is done right. “The algorithms improve yields,” he says.Such improvements are vital, given that electronics manufacturing runs on low single digital margins. For Foulger, who began working on neural networks and robotics in the 1990s, the leap is significant. He sees AI being used to shave hours off production cycles, optimise shop floors, and reshape supply chains.Zetwerk Electronics has seven factories, four in Delhi-NCR. Last month, it manufactured about four million devices for top global brands. AI, Foulger says, can unlock “double-digit gains” if applied to scheduling and workflow optimisation, given that factories now rely on human judgment for what to produce, in what order, and with what skills.At Syrma, Arch Systems’ AI is being rolled out across multiple SMT lines. Each line now tracks rated capacity, actual capacity, downtime, identifies defects, does preventive maintenance and checks causes of production delays, if any. “If say 35 machines run for 20 hours (in a 24-hour cycle), that’s a total of 700 hours. Even a 5% improvement gives me 35 extra hours daily. Over a month, that’s like adding an extra line,” Gujral says.AI is bringing efficiency to the ₹request for quote’ (RFQ) process. A product like a smartphone, laptop, or digital camera, could have 500 parts. What parts are already with the company, what has to be ordered at what cost and from where was mostly a manual process. Now the 'quote cell’ (an estimate of cost) is linked to the SAP database via a customised AI that will automatically generate an optimum bill of materials (BoM).Earlier, if a component distributor quoted 15 cents per component while it was available for 10 cents in some global markets, manufacturers in India would not know and start negotiating at 15 cents. “While I might go from 15 to 13 cents, a global manufacturer goes from 10 to 7 cents. Now, AI is making us globally competitive,” says Gujral.Sharma of Deki Electronics, which makes millions of capacitors daily, says if a factory is doing six million welding joints per day for an automobile component, the auto maker wants to know the power (current) tolerances tracked to within one ampere. “AI can be very useful for such applications,” he says.","Gurgaon-based Syrma SGS Technology, an electronics manufacturing services (EMS) firm, signed up with Arch Systems of the US to bring AI into its factories.

Cheap flights Wizz Air Abu Dhabi → Larnaca: Dates, price & how often



WIZZ Go (from around AED 250–300 one-way): includes a 20 kg checked bag, seat selection, and priority boarding.

WIZZ Plus (from around AED 400+): adds flexible rebooking, larger luggage, and refund options.

Larnaca on a shoestring, what to see and where to save

Smart booking guide for middle-class travelers — How to fly cheaper and smarter

Book Early, Not Last-Minute: Wizz Air uses a dynamic pricing model the earlier you book, the cheaper it gets. Aim to book at least 6–8 weeks before travel. Prices jump closer to holidays, especially Christmas, New Year, and school breaks.

Travel Light — One Small Bag Can Save You Hundreds: Wizz Air’s Basic fare only includes a small carry-on bag (fits under the seat). If you can pack light think roll-up clothes, travel-size toiletries, and digital boarding passes you can skip baggage fees entirely. For longer trips, one 20 kg checked bag shared by two people can be cheaper than paying for two separate ones.

Join WIZZ discount club (Optional but worth it for families): Frequent travelers or families can join WIZZ Discount Club for around €35 (AED 135) per year. It gives €10–20 (AED 40–80) off most fares and extra discounts on baggage often paying for itself in one round trip for two people.

Avoid paying extra at the Airport: Print your boarding pass or have it ready on the Wizz app airport printing fees can be steep. Also, always pre-book luggage and seats online. Adding them at the counter can cost 50–70% more.

Compare total cost, not just the ticket: A €25 fare looks great but remember to factor in:

Seat selection (optional: €5–10) Cabin baggage (optional: €20–30 if upgraded)

Airport meals and transfers: Even then, Wizz Air’s total cost is usually less than half of full-service airlines on similar routes.

Use Budget-Friendly Payment & Travel Tools: Book directly on wizzair.com or the Wizz Air app for the best deals. Pay in AED to avoid currency conversion fees. For accommodation, look for apart-hotels or local guesthouses in Larnaca Old Town — cheaper and walkable.

Bonus tip (Turn it into a smart Europe trip): Cyprus is part of the EU’s Schengen zone, so with a Schengen visa, you can easily connect to Greece, Malta, or Italy via short hops from Larnaca — all on budget carriers. Perfect for families or couples looking to stretch one visa into a full European experience.

Entertainment stations, cultural performances, and local volunteer groups are expected to add to the energy of the day.The Zayed Charity Run is one of the UAE’s most successful humanitarian sports initiatives, launched to honor the legacy of the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the Founding Father of the UAE. It reflects his vision of humanity, compassion, and community service through action not just words.The event began in Abu Dhabi in 2001 as a local race aimed at promoting health and social responsibility. Over the years, it evolved into an international movement that combines fitness, philanthropy, and diplomacy. Each edition raises funds for hospitals, medical research, and welfare programs in its host city all under the spirit of “giving without borders.” Unlike commercial races, the Zayed Charity Run’s core niche is humanitarian impact. Every stop donates its proceeds directly to local causes, from cancer treatment in Egypt to children’s hospitals in New York and now family welfare in Rio. The initiative has previously supported organisations such as the Sheikh Khalifa Medical City, Children’s Cancer Hospital in Cairo, and Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi.The goal is simple yet powerful: ""Use running as a bridge between nations and people, promoting health and kindness through collective action""Beyond the race itself, the Rio event is explicitly charitable: proceeds will support local organizations that help vulnerable children, women and families including partnerships with community groups such as Rio Solidario. The National and other coverage note that funds raised at the Rio stop will be channelled into programmes on education, social support and child welfare in the host city. That local focus is central to the Zayed Charity Run’s mission combining sport, culture and humanitarian aid.Participation in the Zayed Charity Run Rio 2025 is open to the public, with organizers encouraging people of all backgrounds to join from professional runners to families and first-time participants. The goal is to make the event accessible while ensuring that every registration contributes to a charitable cause.Runners can sign up online through the official Zayed Charity Run portal and affiliated sports websites.Every participant receives an official race T-shirt, bib number, timing chip, and finisher’s medal, along with access to hydration stations and first-aid support throughout the route.In keeping with its international editions, the Rio leg will also offer cash prizes for top finishers, alongside symbolic awards that honour participation and sportsmanship.Beyond the race itself, the Rio edition is designed as a community festival, complete with cultural showcases, live performances, and local food stalls. Families are encouraged to attend and cheer, turning the event into a day of joy and charity. The event organisers have emphasized that participation is open to all, with proceeds from registration fees and sponsorships directly funding local social welfare initiatives.","The Zayed Charity Run Rio 2025 is set to take place on Saturday, October 5, 2025. It is the first-ever edition in South America. The run will feature two main routes a 5km family-friendly course and a 10km competitive race. Proceeds from the race will support Rio-based welfare organisations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124321897,imgsize-1587779,width-400,resizemode-4/rio-2025.jpg"
Flydubai updates power bank rules from October 2025 following Emirates safety measures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/flydubai-updates-power-bank-rules-from-october-2025-following-emirates-safety-measures/articleshow/124319219.cms,"From October 1, 2025, Flydubai permits one 100Wh-or-less power bank in hand baggage only/Image: Flydubai

Flydubai’s power bank rules: Capacity, usage, and storage





Usage during flight is banned: Charging devices or the power bank itself using aircraft power sockets is not allowed at any time.

Storage location: Power banks must remain inside hand baggage, placed under the seat or in the seat pocket in front of the passenger. They are not allowed in overhead lockers.

Device status: The power bank must be switched off and secured to prevent accidental activation or short circuits.

Protective measures: It is recommended to keep power banks in their original packaging or a protective pouch for added safety.

Checked baggage: Power banks cannot be carried in checked luggage under any circumstances.



Lithium battery transport and related devices





Devices in checked baggage must be switched off and secured to prevent accidental activation during the flight.

Passengers uncertain about the compliance of their devices are advised to contact Flydubai before travelling for clarification.

Despite many aircraft offering in-seat charging, passengers should fully charge their devices before departure, especially on longer flights, as inflight charging is restricted for safety reasons.

Emirates’ influence on Flydubai’s policy





Allowing one power bank per passenger, limited to 100 Wh or less.

Prohibiting power bank use for charging personal devices or themselves via aircraft power sockets.

Mandating power banks be stored in seat pockets or under-seat bags, not overhead compartments.

Banning power banks in checked luggage altogether.





Starting October 1, 2025, Flydubai has implemented new, stricter guidelines for carrying power banks onboard flights, aligning with Emirates and UAE-wide safety standards. Passengers are allowed to carry only one power bank per person in hand baggage, subject to capacity limits and storage rules designed to reduce lithium battery-related risks during flights.Flydubai permits passengers to bring a single power bank in their carry-on luggage with a watt-hour (Wh) rating of 100 Wh or less. This capacity must be clearly indicated on the device itself, whether through labels, embossing, or printed information. Any power bank exceeding 100 Wh is strictly prohibited from all flights.Passengers must adhere to the following:Flydubai’s guidelines extend beyond power banks to all lithium-powered devices including laptops, mobile phones, e-cigarettes, rechargeable batteries, and digital cameras. Key points include:Flydubai’s new power bank restrictions follow Emirates’ announcement in August 2025, which took effect simultaneously on October 1. Emirates implemented similar measures after an increase in incidents linked to lithium battery-powered devices onboard. Their key restrictions include:Flydubai’s alignment with Emirates reflects broader UAE airline efforts to tighten inflight safety and prevent potential hazards related to portable electronic devices.","From October 1, 2025, Flydubai permits one 100Wh-or-less power bank in hand baggage only.

UAE: Sharjah police release hard-hitting video to curb phone use and distracted driving behind the wheel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-sharjah-police-release-hard-hitting-video-to-curb-phone-use-and-distracted-driving-behind-the-wheel/articleshow/124318198.cms,"Sharjah Police’s new video warns drivers: seconds on your phone risk lives — 267 crashes linked to phone use this year./ AI Representative Image, for illustrative purposes only

Sharjah police awareness video: seconds of distraction cost lives

Local toll and legal consequences: 267 accidents and strict penalties

Sharjah road accidents and phone-related crashes analysis

Total reported road accidents in Sharjah (2025, Jan–Sep): ~1,950

Percentage linked to phone use: ~14%

Fatalities linked to phone use: 12 deaths reported

Common scenarios: texting while driving, scrolling social media, answering calls without hands-free devices

Nationwide push: coordinated campaigns and traffic-safety programs

What drivers must do — simple actions that save lives

Put the phone on Do Not Disturb and stow it before you start driving.

Use hands-free only if absolutely necessary — best practice is to stop safely before interacting.

Rely on passenger assistance for navigation or calls, or set directions before you move.

Report distracted drivers to authorities when safe to do so.





Sharjah Police have launched a hard-hitting awareness video warning drivers that even a few seconds of phone use behind the wheel can lead to tragic accidents, highlighting 267 crashes this year linked to distracted driving and urging everyone to “Don’t Be The Next Number. ”Sharjah Police released a new awareness video on October 4, 2025, showing how a few seconds spent replying, scrolling or taking a photo behind the wheel can lead to irreversible tragedy. The message is blunt: every statistic is a person’s life, and every “number” in the tally represents a preventable story. The short film closes with the campaign slogan, “Don’t be the next number,” urging drivers to put phones away while driving.Sharjah officials say 267 traffic accidents this year were linked specifically to mobile-phone use while driving, a figure Sharjah Police are using to underline the growing scale of the problem. Across the UAE, distracted driving penalties are steep: using a hand-held phone can incur an AED 800 fine and four black points under federal traffic law, with repeat or severe aggravated offences sometimes attracting vehicle impoundment.Authorities now routinely use smart cameras and increased patrols to detect and deter offenders.Sharjah Police have revealed that 267 traffic accidents in 2025 so far were directly linked to mobile phone use while driving. These accidents include collisions ranging from minor fender-benders to serious crashes causing injuries and fatalities.To put this into perspective:Authorities note that distracted driving has overtaken speeding as one of the leading causes of accidents in Sharjah. Patrols and smart traffic cameras are being used to detect offenders, while the awareness campaigns aim to reduce these numbers significantly.Experts say that even 3–5 seconds of distraction at typical city speeds can result in a collision, emphasizing that campaigns like “Don’t Be The Next Number” are crucial for behavioral change.The Sharjah campaign is part of a broader UAE drive against distracted driving. Federal and emirate police forces (including Dubai and Abu Dhabi) have released similar hard-hitting videos and data in recent months, and the Ministry of Interior’s road-safety events have explicitly focused on “driving without a phone.” Authorities combine public education, technological enforcement (smart cameras, AI monitoring) and legal penalties to cut incidents.These steps take seconds to set up and dramatically reduce crash risk; the goal of the campaign is behavior change, not blame.","Sharjah Police released a new awareness video on October 4, 2025, showing how a few seconds spent replying, scrolling or taking a photo behind the wheel can lead to tragedy. 267 traffic accidents in 2025 so far were directly linked to mobile phone use while driving.

As 2025 draws to a close, residents of the UAE have an extraordinary celestial lineup to look forward to. From the giant Harvest Moon dramatically lighting up October skies alongside Saturn and Jupiter, to three consecutive supermoons and multiple dazzling meteor showers illuminating the night, the coming months promise a stunning and memorable display of natural cosmic events clearly visible without special telescopes.On October 7, the first of three year-end supermoons, the Harvest Moon—will dazzle skywatchers across the UAE and worldwide. This full moon will coincide with the moon’s closest approach to Earth, making it appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than usual. The moon’s size seems especially impressive near the horizon, thanks to the “moon illusion,” where our eyes perceive it as bigger against familiar foreground objects like trees or buildings.The Harvest Moon, historically named for its role in aiding farmers to gather crops before winter, will rise just after sunset and remain visible in full form until October 9. Leading up to this, starting October 1, the waxing gibbous moon will draw closer to Saturn, creating a striking pairing in the southeastern evening sky. By October 5, observers will see the moon and Saturn rising side by side on the eastern horizon, just below the Summer Triangle formed by the stars Vega, Altair, and Deneb.Though Saturn’s actual diameter is 35 times larger than the moon’s, its immense distance—over a billion kilometers—makes it appear only as a small golden point near the bright lunar disc. Jupiter will also be visible nearby, adding to one of the year’s most remarkable and easily observable astronomical displays, best seen away from city lights under clear, dark skies.The Harvest Moon on October 7 marks the start of a unique sequence for the UAE: three consecutive supermoons occurring over three months. These include:Each supermoon will be visible across the UAE wherever there is a clear horizon, offering residents a unique and accessible opportunity to witness these lunar phenomena.The cosmic calendar doesn’t end with supermoons. UAE skies are also expected to light up with three major meteor showers, each offering unique viewing opportunities:All these meteor showers will be visible without special equipment, though stargazers are encouraged to seek dark-sky locations away from city lights for the best experience.To maximize enjoyment of these celestial events, residents are advised to:According to Khadijah Al Hariri, Operations Manager at Dubai Astronomy Group, these lunar and meteor events provide a unique chance for UAE residents to engage with the universe’s natural wonders without needing specialized equipment.","The Harvest Moon on October 7 marks the start of a unique sequence for the UAE: three consecutive supermoons occurring over three months.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

"Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu: Whether it is Google or Apple, when they operate in India, they have to….",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zoho-founder-sridhar-vembu-whether-it-is-google-or-apple-when-they-operate-in-india-they-have-to-/articleshow/124376512.cms,"Sridhar Vembu ’s three faces of privacy

What Zoho’s Sridhar Vembu wrote on X

On the topic of privacy, there are three distinct cases I want to address:

1. The secret lover case

2. The violation we feel when a company uses our personal data to show ads to us

3. The secret rebel case

The secret lover case also applies to org trade secrets and confidential data but ""secret lover"" is more catchy 😁

We work hard to ensure your privacy in case 1. Our tech stack and product are designed with this as a major goal.

Let me come to case 2. By taking a vow to not use your data to try to sell you stuff, we protect you from that sense of distaste or violation. Our strong stand also ensures that corporate confidential data or trade secrets do not get leaked to those ad-related data mining systems.

The secret rebel case is subject to the laws of the nations we operate in. Any company operating in a jurisdiction promising to protect a secret rebel against their own government is making a false promise. Sovereign power always prevails over mere companies. Whether it is Google or Apple, when they operate in India, they have to comply with Indian law and likewise Zoho has to comply with US law when operating in America.

So while secret rebels can communicate like secret lovers do, secret rebels cannot expect courts to affirm their right to plot against their government.

Our stand has been consistent on this matter. I have said these in our Zoholics events in many locations around the world for well over a decade.





Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu outlined his company’s approach to users’ privacy and the limits of corporate responsibility on X (formerly Twitter) recently. In the post, he described three privacy cases – secret lover, use of personal data to show ads and secret rebel. He also emphasized that all companies must follow the laws of the country in which they operate. “Whether it is Google or Apple, when they operate in India, they have to comply with Indian law and likewise Zoho has to comply with US law when operating in America,” Vembu writes in the post. His remarks comes as the company's messaging platform Arattai gains popularity, topping both Apple App Store and Google Play Store.The first, which he called the “secret lover case,” refers to personal data, corporate trade secrets, and confidential information. He said Zoho designs its technology and products to protect such data and maintain strict privacy.The second, he said, involves the use of personal data for targeted advertising. Zoho has pledged not to use customer data to sell products or services, a practice Vembu said prevents a sense of violation and protects corporate confidential information from ad-related data-mining systems.The third, the “secret rebel case,” refers to situations where individuals may seek to challenge their governments.","Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu outlined his company’s approach to users’ privacy and the limits of corporate responsibility on X.

This keyboard from Google makes you dial every letter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-keyboard-from-google-makes-you-dial-every-letter/articleshow/124361412.cms,"Want One? You'll have to make It yourself





It's October, which means Google Japan's Gboard team is back with another wild keyboard concept. This time, they've ditched traditional keys entirely for spinning dials inspired by old rotary phones. You guessed it right—to type on this keyboard, which Google calls the Gboard Dial Version, you rotate discs to select characters instead of tapping keys.The concept keyboard features nine dials of varying sizes arranged across its surface, each representing different sets of alphanumeric characters and functions. There's even a dedicated dial just for the return key. To type, you stick your finger in the appropriate hole, rotate the dial to your desired character, and release—letting it spin back to its starting position with a satisfying whir.While rotary phones relied on pulse dialling with electrical signals, Google Japan's version uses modern sensors to track each dial's rotation and convert it into USB signals. The team argues this slower, more deliberate input method could actually reduce typing-related strain and minimise accidental key presses, though you definitely won't be breaking any speed records.True to form with Google Japan's annual keyboard experiments, the Dial Version isn't hitting store shelves.Instead, the team has released all design files—including 3D printer models, circuit board schematics, and firmware—on GitHub under an Apache 2.0 license. Anyone with the patience and tools can build their own rotary keyboard at home.This wouldn't be Google Japan's first rodeo into the territory of weird keyboards. The team is notorious for its concepts—a 65-inch-long single-row keyboard, a bendable version that wraps around objects, and a teacup-shaped cylindrical design.Google even created a matching accessory: a mouse stand that automatically turns off your webcam during video calls when you place your mouse on top—a modern twist on the old ""hang up to disconnect"" phone feature.","Google Japan's Gboard team has created a rotary keyboard.

I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.

I do not make any of my own clothing. I speak a language I did not invent or refine. I did not discover the mathematics I use. I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.

I am moved by music I did not create myself. When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive. I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.

OpenAI has a nonprofit governing board







Following the announcement that OpenAI could receive a 10% ownership stake in AMD as part of a new chip partnership, Elon Musk immediately questioned the move, asking a ""Good question"" about the ownership of OpenAI's nonprofit parent. Musk has repeatedly attacked the company's structure and criticised its shift away from its original mission. At one point, he even called CEO Sam Altman ""Scam Altman."".Tesla CEO’s ‘Good Question’ post quotes a financial analysis highlighting OpenAI's massive funding—$100B from Nvidia, option for 10% AMD stake, $500B Stargate project, and $500B valuation—questioning its nonprofit parent ownership, and signaling skepticism amid xAI competition.These claims align with 2025 announcements: Nvidia's phased $100B infrastructure investment (September), AMD's chip deal with 10% warrant option (October), Stargate's $500B multi-year buildout with Oracle and SoftBank (January onward), and a $6.6B share sale confirming the $500B valuation (early October).OpenAI maintains a nonprofit governing board overseeing its capped-profit subsidiary, a structure updated in May 2025 to a Public Benefit Corporation model retaining nonprofit control.It is to be noted that Microsoft and OpenAI signed a non-binding agreement in September to finalise the terms of their relationship. Under the new agreement, OpenAI is allowed to restructure into a for-profit company and secure more compute power by partnering with other firms like Oracle. The deal also aims to balance OpenAI's need for broader partnerships and compute independence with Microsoft's desire for continued access to OpenAI's advanced AI models.The key terms include the nonprofit arm receiving over $100 billion, though details on Microsoft's ownership stake and exclusive access remain undisclosed.",Tesla CEO questions OpenAI's nonprofit parent ownership.

Desi CEO Aravind Srinivas to companies: Perplexity's Comet browser can replace your next hire; ‘Instead of hiring one more person…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/desi-ceo-aravind-srinivas-to-companies-perplexitys-comet-browser-can-replace-your-next-hire-instead-of-hiring-one-more-person/articleshow/124363579.cms,"US Government Shutdown Enters Second Week: Why It Happened & Who It Impacts

Comet can help with productivity and financial gains







Aravind Srinivas, desi CEO and founder of Perplexity AI, has stated that the startup’s new AI browser, Comet, can boost productivity so significantly that companies can skip hiring new employees. He characterised the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered web browser as a ‘true personal assistant,’ allowing users to complete more tasks in the same amount of time.“Instead of hiring one more person on your team, you could just use Comet to supplement all the work that you’re doing,” Srinivas told CNBC in an interview.Comet functions by browsing the internet to assist with research and can asynchronously perform multiple tasks, with Srinivas noting, “It’s truly about delivering value and you being able to delegate tasks to it.”Srinivas estimated that the productivity gains from Comet could be worth $10,000 per year for a single person. He also believes the economic impact of such gains could be massive.Given that ""human digital knowledge work"" contributes around $25 trillion to the gross domestic product, he estimated that a 20% gain in productivity, facilitated by tools like Comet, could easily translate to $5 trillion in GDP growth.This comes as major tech companies continue to bolster their AI spending. Tech giants like Meta, Amazon , Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet are collectively expected to spend as much as $320 billion on AI technologies and datacentre expansions in 2025, the report noted.Perplexity initially launched Comet in July to users of its premium Perplexity Max subscription ($200 per month), quickly garnering a waitlist of millions of people. The browser was made available to download for free globally last week.","Aravind Srinivas, desi CEO and founder of Perplexity AI, has stated that the startup’s new AI browser, Comet, can boost productivity so significantly that companies can skip hiring new employees.

"Vinod Khosla comes to OpenAI's support on Sora 2 app, that critics called ""terrifying""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/vinod-khosla-comes-to-openais-support-on-sora-2-app-that-critics-called-terrifying/articleshow/124362669.cms,"Sora 2: Innovation or threat



Khosla: Creativity, not fear







ChatGPT creator OpenAI recently launched its new video-generation tool — Sora 2. Now, billionaire venture capitalist Vinod Khosla has stepped in to defend the platform. Khosla has also criticised the critics for their narrow-mindedness. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Khosla — one of the early investors in OpenAI has dismissed the negative reactions to Sora 2 as elitist and shortsighted. “Let the viewers of this ‘slop’ judge it, not ivory tower luddite snooty critics or defensive creatives,” he wrote, referring to those who have labeled the app as “AI slop” or “brain rot.” He further described detractors as “tunnel vision creatives.”Sora 2 is known for its ability to generate realistic, AI-powered video clips from the text prompts. The video generation tool has become the most-talked about AI tools of 2025. The viral demos and its integration with creative platforms have made it popular among content creators, marketers and educators. However, with this popularity comes imitation.Business Insider’s Katie Notopoulos described the app as “terrifying,” noting that it’s the first time AI has come close to mimicking real life so convincingly that viewers may struggle to tell what’s real and what’s fake.Khosla has compared the backlash received by Sora 2 to early skeptism around digital music in the 1990s and digital photography in the 2000. He argued that Sora 2 opens up “so many more avenues of creativity if you have an imagination.” His comments reflect growing tension between traditional creatives and tech innovators, as AI tools begin to reshape how content is produced, consumed, and monetize.","Venture capitalist Vinod Khosla has defended the AI-powered video-generation tool, Sora 2.
