‘Chasing shadow in room of mirrors’: Why Delhi Police can’t crack the school bomb threat puzzle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/chasing-shadow-in-room-of-mirrors-why-bomb-hoax-probes-hit-dead-end/articleshow/128571891.cms,"Blame It On Ironclad Privacy Of Swiss Servers, Geopolitical Opacity Of Foreign Domains, VPN Shields

AI Impact Summit, Supreme Court on CAA, India-France Ties & More





NEW DELHI: After some south Delhi schools received bomb hoaxes earlier this month, a technical probe led police to a virtual private network (VPN) service in Bangladesh. Days later, a spate of similar threats in northwest Delhi led them to a US-based VPN, while hoaxes reported in west Delhi schools a few months ago involved a Singapore-based VPN. However, even as police were busy writing to these networks to gather user details, they were flooded with more hoaxes.So, why is the law enforcement seemingly helpless in curbing this menace?When a threatening email lands in the inbox of a school in the city, the tactical response in the form of blaring sirens, evacuation of students and deployment of sniffer dogs and cops on the campuses is loud and swift.However, in tech dens of the police cyber cell, the reaction is quieter and the fightback uphill and borderline demoralising. For Delhi's cyber-investigators, each hoax call represents a forensic dead end.Despite a string of such high-profile scares stretching into early 2026, the perpetrators remain digital ghosts. The inability to crack these cases isn't due to a lack of manpower, but owing to unsurmountable technical hurdles: the ironclad privacy of Swiss servers, geopolitical opacity of foreign domains and multi-layered shields of VPNs.When investigators attempt to ‘ping' the origin of a threat, they aren't led to a desktop in Delhi, but to a server in a jurisdiction like Panama or the Seychelles. Using VPN chains — routing a connection through multiple encrypted tunnels — the perpetrator ensures that the IP address visible to Delhi Police is a dummy.""The hoaxers hide their actual location in Delhi or elsewhere behind a series of encrypted ‘tunnels'. The IP address that police see may belong to a server in Austria, Singapore or Netherlands. To us, it is like chasing a shadow in a room full of mirrors; every time we think we have a lead, the trail bounces to another country,"" said a cyber cell investigator.To get a real IP, police must request logs from a VPN provider. However, most premium services used by these actors operate on a strict no-log policy, meaning they do not store records of who use their services at a specific time. Simply put, there's no data to be handed over to the cops. So, the trail doesn't just go cold, it ceases to exist in the physical world.This wall of anonymity is reinforced by the choice of platform. In several high-profile waves of bomb threats, including the massive surge in hoaxes in May 2024 and the recent cases this month, the senders utilised Switzerland-based ProtonMail. Known for its militant commitment to privacy, ProtonMail uses end-to-end encryption, which even it can't bypass, and does not require a phone number or personal details to create an account. From an investigative standpoint, this is a nightmare.Because the service is protected by Swiss privacy laws, Delhi Police can't issue a standard search warrant. It must navigate the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty — a diplomatic marathon that requires proving ‘double criminality' (that the act is a crime in both India and Switzerland). Even then, the most police may receive is basic metadata — like the time of the creation of an account — which is rarely enough to identify a sophisticated user who had signed up using a masked identity.The ‘Russian angle' adds a final layer of complexity. Many hoax emails carry an ‘.ru' suffix, often from services like mail.ru. Investigators frequently find that these domains are used as a tactical smokescreen.By the time a request for information moves through the bureaucratic channels of Interpol, the specific account is usually deleted and the logs are overwritten.Occasionally, police do catch a break — usually when a ‘copycat' or a student makes a fundamental error in operational security, such as forgetting to turn on the VPN or using a personal recovery email. In late 2024, a student in Delhi was apprehended after sending a threat to his own school to avoid taking an an exam. He had forgotten to turn on his VPN, leaving his home IP address exposed.However, for the professional operators who target dozens of schools simultaneously, the global digital architecture is their greatest ally. The sheer volume of schools targeted — sometimes over 100 in a single morning — suggests a level of planning that involves scraping school databases from the dark web or using automated crawlers.So, as long as this infrastructure allows for perfect anonymity, all Delhi Police can do is operate within a reactive loop: evacuate students, search bags and declare hoaxes, while those behind the screen remain digital phantoms.","Delhi's cyber-investigators, each hoax call represents a forensic dead end.

Jordan Cowan, figure skating cameraman, transforms Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics coverage experience



At the Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics, figure skating fans are seeing moments never shown before on television. As skaters finish their routines and emotions take over, a camera now follows them across the rink. The person behind this new view is former American competitive ice dancer Jordan Cowan. Skating alongside athletes with a special camera rig he designed, Cowan records reactions immediately after performances, showing relief, tears, and celebration in real time.Broadcasts traditionally cut away once the music ends, but Cowan calls that period an unexplored part of the sport. Olympic Broadcasting Services introduced the experiment to make coverage more personal. Viewers now see athletes leaving the ice before they reach coaches in the kiss-and-cry area. Cowan’s work has quickly gained attention because it reveals emotions usually hidden from audiences and gives fans a closer connection to the skaters’ experience.Jordan Cowan grew up in Los Angeles and began skating as a child. Speaking to Reuters , he joked that the rink felt special because it had air conditioning while his home did not.His curiosity about the sport led him to train seriously in Michigan, where he competed in ice dance before retiring from competition.After stepping away from skating, he struggled to choose between film and science. He eventually combined both interests. While filming an ice show in Sun Valley for a PBS production, he recorded behind-the-scenes footage using a phone and small stabilizer. Producers later used the shots, impressed by the camera appearing to float across the ice.Since then, Cowan has upgraded his equipment from a phone to cinema-style cameras. He uses manual focus and zoom, believing a skater can anticipate motion better than autofocus systems. His skating skills allow him to follow athletes smoothly without interrupting their performance environment.Cowan says his presence can also comfort competitors during difficult moments. Some athletes told him having another skater nearby makes the experience feel less lonely. He keeps distance so they can process emotions while still capturing the crowd’s reaction.He worked closely with Olympic Broadcasting Services, which also introduced drones and overhead cameras at these Games. For Cowan, the role is meaningful even though he never competed in the Olympics. He hopes his footage becomes part of a long-lasting record of the sport and remains meaningful decades from now.","Jordan Cowan, figure skating cameraman, transforms Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics coverage experience.

Kayla Nicole Talks about ""Right Person, Wrong Timing"" as Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift Plan Summer 2026 Wedding



""You were in it for real / She was in her phone / and you were just a pose.""

America's Next Top Model

""She’s out here romanticizing a situationship that ended in 2022… we’ve had two Olympics since then""

It’s been nearly four years since Kayla Nicole and Travis Kelce called it quits, but it seems like the drama is fresher than ever in 2026. A recent interview clip has gone viral where Kayla gets vulnerable about her relationship history, specifically using the phrase ""right person, wrong time. "" While she was trying to be deep about the ""headspace"" needed for marriage, fans aren't buying it.The reaction from the internet has been swift (no pun intended) and blunt: ""Just accept he didn’t pick you.""The reason this specific interview is causing such an uproar is because of what’s happening in Travis’s actual life. He’s currently planning a summer 2026 wedding with Taylor Swift. To fans, hearing Kayla talk about ""wrong timing"" makes it sound like she believes they’d still be together if the stars had aligned differently. The harsh reality, according to commenters, is that he simply found the ""right person"" in someone else.Adding fuel to the fire is Kayla’s recent Super Bowl commercial for the Sleeper app. In the ad, she plays a woman getting ""ex-communicated"" from a famous ex, with a punchline that literally uses the word ""Swiftly."" While Kayla has claimed she wants to ""reclaim her narrative,"" fans feel she’s doing the opposite. By constantly accepting jobs and doing interviews that center around being ""the ex,"" she’s keeping herself in a shadow that Travis moved out of years ago.Just last week, Kayla posted content joking about being single on Valentine's Day. While usually harmless, because Travis and Taylor are currently in the news for planning their summer 2026 wedding. In late 2025, Taylor Swift released a song called ""Opalite"" (from her latest album). Fans are convinced the lyrics shade Kayla:Kayla responded on Instagram with a cryptic clip of Eva Marcille fromsaying, ""I don't compare myself to other girls... I'm no comparison to anyone else.""The consensus on social media is that there’s a fine line between sharing your truth and being stuck in the past. With Travis and Taylor’s wedding just months away, the ""right person, wrong time"" excuse feels more like a refusal to move on than a relatable life lesson. As one viral comment put it:Whether the comment was for Travis or someone else only she knows but fans aren't letting it slide easily.","A recent interview clip of Kayla Nicole has gone viral.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Japan’s legendary Samurai: Unveil the mysterious legacy of knights from fearsome swordsmen to masterful artists,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/japans-legendary-samurai-unveil-the-mysterious-legacy-of-knights-from-fearsome-swordsmen-to-masterful-artists/articleshow/128598045.cms,"AI Generated

Japan’s samurai warriors: History and origin



Samurai were more than warriors: Skills went beyond the sword

Are samurai only men



What do samurai wear when off the battlefield



What is the meaning of the word ‘samurai’



Do samurai exist today







What comes to your mind when you hear the term ‘samurai’? For most people, the imagination rolls out like men on the battlefield, clad in armour, wielding a sword, and unwavering in loyalty. From the medieval period, the story began during that period with an over 1000-year history, which holds great significance in understanding the evolution.The legacy of the samurai from the medieval cultural history years ago to today has been relentlessly celebrated as part of the contemporary video games, TV shows, films, and more. The samurai were believed to be the knights of old, as fearless, loyal, disciplined Japanese warriors from the ukiyo-prints of the 18th century to the present. But the story isn’t that simple; it is quite complex and more surprising than what Hollywood reveals.According to the British Museum’s new Samurai exhibition, the samurai, who are often imagined as part of a fantasy world, are not only featured in Star Wars or popular video games but were also real, mysterious warriors with a rich and compelling history. Their lives were disciplined, marked by strict codes of honour, and intertwined with both politics and culture.Here’s how the true story of the samurai unfolds.As per the curator of the exhibition, Rosina Buckland, the perception of the samurai as warriors is accurate in terms of how they rose to positions of power. ‘But that’s not everything,’ says Buckland, highlighting their influence beyond battle and warfare.As reported, the origins begin in the 10th century when they were first recruited for the imperial courts as mercenary warriors. By the 12th century, Japan faced a series of open battles on the streets, uprisings, and rebellions, which allowed the samurai to capitalise on the unrest, acquire major political power, and establish a military government (shogunate) in 1185, reshaping the country’s social and political landscape for centuries.The samurai were also open to new ideas and technology from other cultures. For example, a samurai armour on display at the exhibition was based on a Portuguese design, with a pointed front and angled sides to deflect musket bullets. These features became necessary after European firearms arrived in Japan in 1543.Alongside their military skills, samurai learned refined arts like painting, poetry, music, theatre, and tea ceremonies. Military leaders, called Shōguns, realised that brute force alone wasn’t enough to rule effectively. They combined military strength with subtle forms of influence within court society.Their approach to governing was influenced by Chinese philosophy, especially Confucian ideas. Buckland explains, “In Neo-Confucian thought, you need a balance between military power and cultural skill.” This led to an emphasis on soft power, such as diplomacy and courtly culture. The exhibition also displays a 19th-century fan painted by a samurai artist, showing the unexpected artistry of these warriors.From the 12th century to the 16th century, high-ranking women also held great power. For example, Hojo Masako, who was married to the first shogun Minamoto Yoritomo, acted as the regent several times. During the Tokugawa period, half of the samurai class was comprised of women who had important household chores and raised children.As reported, the objects in the British Museum’s exhibition, accessories, robes, and various other objects explains the story of samurai women.According to their ranks, samurai wear outfits depending on their rank. Their outfits might vary from the lavish textiles of high-ranking samurai to imported textiles. This is far different from the low-ranking samurai whose clothing was expressed by wearing long katana and short wakizashi with different mounts. Tsuba is believed to come in all shapes and sizes, which is mostly made of iron but can also be made of copper, brass, or enamel.The term emerges from the Japanese verb ‘saburau’, which means to serve. This hints at the men of origin who served as the governors. And historically, the terms are used to describe the members of the ruling class.Not really. As a distinct social-military class, it no longer exists. As per the reports, their official status ended in the late 19th century when Japan modernised its military and government.However, their legacy lives on. Samurai values like loyalty, discipline, and honour influence Japanese culture. Martial arts such as kendo and iaido, traditional ceremonies, and cultural storytelling still carry their spirit. Samurai armour, swords, and art are preserved in museums, exhibitions, and collections worldwide.","The British Museum’s new Samurai exhibition explains the true story of the samurai.

"In New Zealand, a judge wrestles with AI-assisted apology",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/in-new-zealand-a-judge-wrestles-with-ai-assisted-apology/articleshow/128536265.cms,"Image: IANS





A judge in New Zealand who discovered last week that apology letters from a defendant in an arson case had been written with the help of artificial intelligence raised questions about the sincerity of her sentiments.“The issue of remorse is interesting,” said the judge, Tom Gilbert, of the district court in Christchurch, as he mulled the punishment of a woman who had pleaded guilty to arson and other charges. Remorse can be a mitigating factor in sentencing. Her letters to the victims and the court were nicely written, the judge said. “Out of curiosity I punched into two AI tools ‘draft me a letter for a judge expressing remorse,’” the judge said, according to a transcript of the sentencing hearing. “It became immediately apparent that these were two AI-generated letters, albeit with tweaks around the edges.”Judge Gilbert said he was not criticising the defendant’s use of AI. “But certainly when one is considering the genuineness of an individual’s remorse, simply producing a computer-generated letter does not really take me anywhere as far as I am concerned,” he said, according to the transcript.The judge was not alone in wrestling with the question of authenticity in AI-assisted writing.Increasingly, people are outsourcing many tasks to machines, including writing apologies, eulogies and wedding vows inviting the ire of some of their fellow humans.Social scientists say the questions raised by use of these tools go beyond etiquette. “It’s a mirror into who we are and what we care about as humans,” Jim Everett, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Kent in Britain, said about the case.Everett worked on a series of recent studies on the perception of AI use and users. Across the six studies Everett worked on, 4,000 participants were asked about 20 tasks. The aim was to understand how people perceive those who use AI. “AI is a tool for efficiency, and it can be helpful, but it also typically involves, and signals, reduced effort,” Everett said. But the use of such tools acts as a kind of proxy for character traits, the researchers found. The findings suggest that people generally perceived those using AI as lazier, less competent and less trustworthy, and their work as less meaningful.The situation in the New Zealand court was a real-life test of the perceptions that the researchers sought to identify. “An AI could be perfectly trained on all apologies but one might still think that a specific apology it then generates in a new instance is not authentic because it does not come from the kind of processes deemed important in an apology: a personal recollection of the wrong, a commitment to change,” the study said.Judge Gilbert said he was willing to give the defendant some credit for genuine remorse. But he granted only a 5% reduction in the sentence. He sentenced the defendant to 27 months in prison.","A New Zealand judge discovered that apology letters from a defendant in an arson case had been written with the help of artificial intelligence.

Scientists spot glowing green microbes in a pitch-dark Carlsbad Caverns cave



Cave microbes use near-infrared light to photosynthesise at record low levels



Research reshapes search for extraterrestrial life



Extreme cave environments preserve early adaptations





Microbial communities hidden deep inside the caves of New Mexico have fascinated scientists who study extreme environments and search for extraterrestrial life. In 2018, the team of scientists at Carlsbad Caverns came across strange green colonies on the limestone walls, which were very far away from the natural light. Later, these microbes were confirmed to be cyanobacteria, which have the ability to conduct photosynthesis using near-infrared light. According to the study, these bacteria have existed in their present form for the last 4 to 9 million years. This discovery indicates that life is able to exist even under conditions that had been regarded as too dark to support life.The research, which was done by Hazel Barton of the University of Alabama and Lars Behrendt of Uppsala University, has a potential impact on biology and astrobiology. Besides that, it reveals how organisms modify themselves to survive with very low energy supplies in enclosed and low-light environments.The discovery was made in an alcove that appeared entirely black to the eye. When researchers shone a torch across the wall, a bright green layer became visible. The colour was striking against the stone. Laboratory testing showed the growth consisted of cyanobacteria, single-celled organisms often linked to surface environments where sunlight is present.What made this colony different was its location. The area receives no direct sunlight. It sits well beyond the cave entrance. Yet the microbes were active and stable.Further analysis revealed that these organisms contain chlorophyll d and chlorophyll f. These pigments allow absorption of near-infrared light, which sits beyond the range visible to humans. This kind of light is weak and spread out. In the cave, it seems to reflect and spread out from the rock walls in small amounts. Microbes use that little energy to make food through photosynthesis. The process works with less light than has been seen before in animals that are similar. It's not exciting, but it's steady.The finding of the study, “Life in the dark: far-red absorbing cyanobacteria extend photic zones deep into terrestrial caves” , has drawn interest from astrobiologists. Understanding the minimum light conditions needed for photosynthesis helps define where life might survive elsewhere. If organisms can adapt to such restricted wavelengths, planets orbiting dimmer stars may remain possible targets.Hazel Barton has said the work aims to identify the longest wavelength and lowest intensity of light that can sustain photosynthesis. That boundary matters. It shapes telescope surveys and guides modelling of exoplanet atmospheres.Carlsbad Caverns provides a controlled setting, with stable temperature and little disturbance. The cyanobacteria appear to have adjusted over long periods to exploit scarce energy. The ecosystem is simple, almost quiet. There is no immediate suggestion of alien microbes waiting in the darkness. But the cave walls offer a reminder that life can persist where expectations narrow. It changes the margins slightly. Sometimes that is enough.","Scientists spot glowing green microbes in a pitch-dark Carlsbad Caverns cave. Microbes use near-infrared light to photosynthesise at record low levels.

Garnt “Gigguk” Maneetapho says Twitch warning forces separate chats during multi-streaming





British streamer and podcaster Garnt “Gigguk” Maneetapho says Twitch has warned him about how he handles chat while multi-streaming. During his February 15, 2026 Twitch broadcast titled “Playing Honkai: Star Rail 4.0 | Full Gameplay Reaction [No Spoilers!],” he told viewers that the platform flagged him for combining YouTube and Twitch chats into one window on screen. According to Garnt “Gigguk” Maneetapho, Twitch said merging both chats breaks its simulcasting rules.He shared that he received a formal warning and was told to keep the chats separate if he continues streaming on both platforms at the same time. Despite that, he made it clear he plans to keep multi-streaming, but will now follow the rule and separate the chats. Twitch’s official Terms of Service publicly state that creators cannot use third-party tools to combine activity, including chat, from other platforms during a simulcast.Speaking directly to his audience, Garnt “Gigguk” Maneetapho explained what happened in a calm and light tone. He said, “What’s up? What’s up? So I got in a little bit of trouble with Twitch the other day. I got in a little bit of trouble because, apparently, it is against terms of services to combine Twitch chats and YouTube chats into one chat. So I got, I got a warning from Twitch.”He added, “I don’t know why, but I got a warning from Twitch to be like, hey, if you do multi-stream again, make sure both chats are separate.”Joking with viewers, he told both chats to stay in their own “corners” and not interact. Then he confirmed, “So, yeah, we are multi streaming once again on YouTube and Twitch.”Twitch’s Terms of Service clearly state: “You do not use third-party services that combine activity from other platforms or services on your Twitch stream during your Simulcast, such as merging chat or other features, to ensure the Twitch community is included in the entirety of the experience of your livestream.”This issue is not new. On April 23, 2025, after Twitch named Rachell “Valkyrae” Hofstetter the third most-watched female streamer of Q1 2025, she also spoke about the same rule.On X, she wrote, “Multi-streaming has been so great the past few months. Only issue is that I like showing chat on stream for VOD watchers but It’s against Twitch TOS to show Youtube chat and it’s not against Youtube TOS to show Twitch chat.. so I can only show Twitch chat on screen.”She also said, “I read both chats but my Youtube chat will forever continue to complain and question if I ever read them lol.” Both creators are still multi-streaming. The only change is how they display chat on screen.","British streamer and podcaster Garnt “Gigguk” Maneetapho says Twitch has warned him about how he handles chat while multi-streaming.

Al Nasr Mosque opens in Sharjah

Glass dome architecture

20 metres in diameter and 16 metres tall, it covers almost 80% of the mosque roof.

Built from honeycomb-patterned hexagonal glass panels, it reflects light throughout the day.

At sunset, as golden light pours through the dome into the prayer hall, the space appears to glow, creating a spiritually uplifting ambience.

Welcoming worshippers

A new Ramadan landmark







In a city known for its record-breaking skyscrapers, one of its most breathtaking architectural triumphs is tucked away in the historic heart of Oud Metha. The Al Nasr Mosque (also known as the Great Mosque of Al Nasr) stands as a unique masterpiece in the UAE’s landscape. While most traditional mosques feature solid stone domes, Al Nasr breaks the mold with a structure that feels as though it is reaching directly for the sky.In time for the start of Ramadan 2026, Sharjah inaugurated a striking new place of prayer, Al Nasr Mosque, designed to serve over 1,300 worshippers and bring both spiritual and architectural beauty to the community.Sheikh Sultan bin Ahmed Al Qasimi, Deputy Ruler of Sharjah, officially opened the mosque on the evening of the moon-sighting announcement that confirmed Ramadan’s arrival.Located in the Jabal Omar neighbourhood of Al Dhaid, the mosque covers more than 7,800 square metres, providing prayer, reflection, and social space for residents of Sharjah and nearby areas.The architectural centerpiece of Al Nasr Mosque is its large spherical glass dome:Next to the dome rises a 38-metre-tall minaret with gently flowing lines, a modern twist on classical mosque silhouettes that harmonises with the round dome instead of rigidly following tradition.The mosque’s layout has been meticulously designed to foster a sense of both comfort and community, providing ample room for the faithful to gather. The main prayer hall offers an intimate setting for 470 worshippers, while the expansive external courtyard and outdoor prayer zones can accommodate an additional 1,180 male worshippers, ensuring that large congregations can pray together during peak times.A dedicated women’s prayer hall provides a private and serene space for 145 worshippers, bringing the total capacity to over 1,300 people.Beyond its primary function as a place of worship, the mosque serves as a comprehensive community hub. It is equipped with essential amenities, including modern ablution areas, restrooms, and a water station.For the staff and ongoing spiritual guidance, the complex includes an imam’s residence. It also looks toward the future of the community with a public reading library and practical facilities such as a mortuary and ample parking.Inside, the architecture emphasizes openness and serenity; the hall is bathed in natural light, complemented by a modern mimbar (pulpit) featuring soft built-in lighting that enhances the spiritual atmosphere without overwhelming the worshippers.The inauguration of Al Nasr Mosque is part of a much larger, nationwide effort to enhance mosque facilities and support growing congregations across the UAE. In Sharjah, this initiative has driven the construction and renovation of dozens of mosques, ensuring every community has access to a modern, well-equipped place of worship.Across the Emirates, mosques are expanding their roles beyond prayer by launching creative Ramadan programs for families and children to encourage community engagement. These efforts are supported by practical measures, such as providing free parking for worshippers in busy areas, reflecting the UAE's commitment to making the spiritual journey of Ramadan as accessible and rewarding as possible for all.","Sharjah’s new Al Nasr Mosque opens for Ramadan with a breathtaking glass dome.

With Ramadan starting on Wednesday, February 18, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has officially recalibrated the city’s pulse. To accommodate late-night prayers, family gatherings, and shorter office hours, Dubai’s transport network has shifted into high gear.Whether you're chasing the sunset for Iftar or heading to the Masjid for Taraweeh, here is everything you need to know to stay on track.Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) announced the official operating schedule for the Dubai Metro during the holy month of Ramadan, reflecting the city’s altered daily routines and travel rhythms.The timings cover both the Red Line and Green Line services, designed to match shifts in commuting patterns as residents fast, pray and gather throughout the month.These revised hours apply from the start of Ramadan, which authorities confirmed will begin around mid-February 2026. Travel patterns will adapt rapidly once fasting begins.These adjusted hours help residents navigate a month where early mornings and late evening activities are more common, particularly around Suhoor (pre-dawn) and Iftar (sunset breaking of fast).The extended Friday night service until 1 am reflects the city’s social rhythm, as many events and prayers occur later in the evening.Ramadan alters daily life in Dubai: work schedules shift earlier, fasting affects peak travel times, and evening social and religious activities extend late into the night.The RTA says the updated Metro schedule ensures greater convenience and service alignment with people’s needs, especially around prayer times, sunset, and Iftar gatherings.Alongside the Metro, other transport services also feature updated timings:These adjustments ensure public transport supports daily life throughout the fasting period and beyond sunset into the night.Parking in Dubai has received a thoughtful ""Iftar Break."" For 2026, the RTA has implemented a two-shift payment system for all paid zones from Monday to Saturday. This is designed to give your wallet a rest exactly when you need it most.As for Salik (Tolls), the peak hour rate of AED 6 applies from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Outside these hours, it drops to AED 4, and it is completely free between 2:00 AM and 7:00 AM, which is perfect for those traveling for early Suhoor.As Ramadan reshapes daily life across the city, Dubai Metro’s revised schedule ensures residents and visitors can move smoothly from early morning commutes to late-night gatherings.With extended Friday hours and adjusted weekday services, the new timings reflect the rhythm of the holy month, balancing work, worship and family time. Commuters are advised to plan journeys in advance and check official updates from Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority to avoid last-minute rushes during peak Iftar hours.","Dubai's Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) announced the official operating schedule for the Dubai Metro during the holy month of Ramadan.

UAE's new Salik toll fees adjustments for Ramadan 2026: What drivers in emirates need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uaes-new-salik-toll-fees-adjustments-for-ramadan-2026-what-drivers-in-emirates-need-to-know/articleshow/128420631.cms,"Ramadan 2026: How Will Salik Toll Fees Affect Your Dubai Commute?

What is changing with Salik toll fees in the UAE



Monday to Saturday



Dh6 (peak rate): 9 am – 5 pm

9 am – 5 pm Dh4 (off-peak rate): 7 am – 9 am and 5 pm – 2 am

7 am – 9 am and 5 pm – 2 am Free (off-peak): 2 am – 7 am

Sunday (excluding public holidays and events)



Dh4 (both peak and off-peak): 7 am – 2 am

7 am – 2 am Free: 2 am – 7 am

Why the Salik toll structure is changing in the UAE

Later starts and shorter days during Ramadan mean peak travel times often shift compared to the rest of the year.

Salik’s new timing accounts for this by extending lower toll periods into early evening and late night, periods when many residents are commuting for iftar (sunset fast-breaking) and evening prayers or social engagements.

Free toll hours in the early pre-dawn period (2 am – 7 am) support non-peak travel and reflect typical reduced road usage.

Quick takeaways for UAE drivers



Expect different Salik charges during Ramadan 2026, with peak hours now between 9 am and 5 pm.

Off-peak and late-night travel is cheaper or free, encouraging motorists to travel outside busy hours.

Adjust your commuting plans, especially around iftar and early mornings, to avoid unexpected toll charges.





With Ramadan 1447 AH (2026) expected to begin in the UAE on either Wednesday or Thursday (around February 18–19), pending the official moon sighting on February 17, Dubai’s road toll operator Salik has announced changes to toll fees to reflect shifts in daily routines during the holy month. These updates aim to improve traffic flow and commuting comfort in line with altered work and school schedules across the city.Salik has introduced a variable pricing structure for toll gates during Ramadan 2026 to better align with expected traffic patterns:These adjustments reflect the shifted daily rhythm in Ramadan, where working hours and schooling usually start later and end earlier to accommodate fasting, prayer, and family time.The revised toll schedule is not simply about price, it is part of a broader strategy to smooth traffic flow across Dubai’s busiest routes during Ramadan:Similar adjustments have been reported in other transport and city services as part of Ramadan preparation, including variable parking timings and public transport schedule shifts. These toll changes come alongside wider seasonal shifts across the UAE as communities prepare for Ramadan.Work hours and school schedules are reduced or revised for the holy month to help residents observe fasting and prayer times comfortably. Other services like parking fees and public transit operations are also adjusted to better align with Ramadan routines. The adjustments aim to support both residents and visitors during what is one of the most significant months in the UAE’s cultural and religious calendar.As Ramadan approaches, keeping track of these changes can help drivers in the UAE plan trips more efficiently and avoid higher toll costs in peak windows.", Ramadan 1447 AH (2026) expected to begin in the UAE on either Wednesday or Thursday (around February 18–19) Dubai’s road toll operator Salik has announced changes to toll fees to reflect shifts in daily routines during the holy month.

'Suicide’ was actually hit-and-run: Dubai Police use AI-powered digital twin to crack case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/suicide-was-actually-hit-and-run-dubai-police-use-ai-powered-digital-twin-to-crack-case/articleshow/128412079.cms,"Dubai Police use advanced Digital Twin technology to digitally reconstruct crime scenes / AI image

Dubai Police solve hit-and-run with AI tech

What is “Digital Twin” tech?

Smart policing in the UAE





Dubai has once again stepped into the future of law enforcement. The Dubai Police General Department of Forensic Evidence and Criminology has officially integrated ""Digital Twin"" technology into its investigative toolkit.This cutting-edge system creates a precise, high-definition virtual replica of a physical crime scene. By using advanced 3D scanning and laser mapping, detectives can now move through a digital version of a room or outdoor area with millimeter accuracy.This means the original environment is ""frozen in time,"" allowing investigators to examine every corner of a scene without actually being there physically.In a striking example of 21st-century policing, Dubai Police used its new Digital Twin technology to overturn the initial conclusion in a bridge-fall incident involving a delivery rider. What first appeared to be a suicide quickly became a hit-and-run case after investigators digitally reconstructed the scene.Using highly detailed 3D modelling and virtual reality tools, officers discovered that the rider’s motorcycle had been struck from behind by another vehicle, causing him to fall from the bridge. The fleeing driver left no trace at the scene, but the Digital Twin analysis offered clear visual and scientific evidence to rewrite the narrative and reclassify the case as a crime rather than a tragic self-inflicted act.This wasn’t the only success for the system. Digital Twin also solved a structural collapse investigation involving a basement parking facility. What appeared to be a mysterious failure was revealed through advanced modelling as the result of repeated water leakage that weakened concrete supports over time. By simulating load stresses with scientific precision, police could pinpoint the exact mechanism of collapse.Unlike traditional forensic methods that rely solely on physical evidence and witness statements, Digital Twin builds a virtual replica of a crime scene using cutting-edge technology. This system merges 3D scanning, artificial intelligence and real-time data analytics into a unified, interactive digital environment.Investigators can revisit this virtual scene at any time, examine evidence from multiple angles, test hypotheses, and even simulate possible sequences of events, all without returning physically to the location. The models are auditable, transparent and designed to support data-driven decision-making, making them especially valuable in courtrooms where evidence must withstand intense scrutiny.The Digital Twin process unfolds in three stages: first, the scene is digitally documented in full detail; then data is refined and enhanced; finally, advanced analytical tools produce intelligent models and outputs that help investigators understand what really happened.Since its rollout, the Digital Twin system has already clarified nearly 85 incidents, according to Dubai Police project managers. By virtually walking through these scenes, investigators can reduce errors, accelerate analysis time, and provide stronger, more reliable forensic conclusions in the judicial process.The Digital Twin initiative isn’t just innovative, it’s award-winning. The technology received a 7-star rating and was named Best Innovative Project at the International Best Practices Competition (IBPC) 2025, as well as winning the UAE Ideas Award 2025 in Smart Government and Digital Transformation.Senior police engineers highlight that Digital Twin is part of a broader strategy to embed technology and AI into all facets of law enforcement in Dubai. The goal is to make criminal investigations faster, more accurate, and more aligned with modern digital realities.This drive aligns with directives from leadership to position Dubai Police as a global leader in tech-powered law enforcement, a vision backed by investments in AI, virtual reality, and data analytics.","Dubai Police has integrated ""Digital Twin"" technology into its investigative toolkit.

The fashion impact beyond the blue shirt

Uniqlo’s bestselling oversized blue cotton shirt

Why the blue shirt trending now





In an era of viral gowns and headline-grabbing couture, it is not a crystal-encrusted dress or archival tiara setting the fashion agenda but a crisp, powder-blue button-down shirt. The most talked-about piece in royal and style circles this week is this sharply tailored Oxford shirt from London label With Nothing Underneath, worn within days by Kate Middleton, Princess of Wales, Meghan Markle , Duchess of Sussex and American Vogue’s editorial heavyweight Chloe Malle.In fashion terms, that is less coincidence and more cultural signal because when three women who define modern power dressing across monarchy, media and Montecito reach for the same quietly confident staple, it tells us that 2026 is not about excess. It is about precision, polish and above all, it is about the enduring magnetism of a perfectly cut shirt.The blue button-down, it seems, is having its royal renaissance as an icon of quintessential British style. The British fashion label is suddenly dominating the style conversation and it is not for a gown or a handbag but the classic blue button-down shirt.The light-blue button-down from London label With Nothing Underneath, popularly known as WNU, has popped up on multiple high-profile figures within days as Kate Middleton, Princess of Wales wore it under a tailored blazer during a visit to Castle Hill Academy in South London to mark Children’s Mental Health Week while Chloe Malle, editorial head of American Vogue, styled it in a video interview alongside icon Anna Wintour . Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, too has worn WNU shirts in the past, including a linen version on her Netflix seriesIt is rare for figures from different royal households, especially ones with distinct personal brands and a top fashion editor to converge on the same piece, which speaks to both the shirt’s versatility and subtle cultural momentum.Founded in 2017 by Pip Durell, a former Tatler and British Vogue professional, With Nothing Underneath specialises in classic shirting inspired by men’s tailoring but sized and proportioned for women. The shirts are inspired by men’s tailoring, British heritage and timeless style, out of Durell’s personal search for shirts that were perfectly adjusted for women, sustainably sourced and stood the test of time.They were borne after years of adjusting men’s shirts for her own use. Combining her fashion knowledge and styling credentials with her own very English, effortless approach to dressing, the brand was launched from her home city of London. Today it has grown to encompass an array of wardrobe essentials, from shirts to tailored trousers, that are not led by trends or fleeting style moments instead, they are designed to be forever items in which to live a life of simplicity. In other words, With Nothing Underneath is not just selling shirts; it is helping define a moment in style that blends classic elegance, accessibility and modern wardrobe versatility.They are pared back, laid back, timeless and effortless clothing and inspired by Carolyn Bessette, Jane Birkin and Charlotte Rampling . The label’s success is measurable with £5.7 million in sales in 2024 and 88% growth over three years. It ranked 52nd on The Sunday Times Hundred list of fastest-growing UK private companies. These numbers suggest that WNU is more than a fleeting celebrity endorsement, it is a brand on the rise.The “Royal effect” still matters. Kate’s sartorial choices have long influenced high street fashion, an impact sometimes referred to as the Kate effect, which can boost British brands by hundreds of millions annually and it is not just high-end. Mainstream retailers are seeing similar spikes. For example:These accessible pieces benefit when “royal style” filters down to everyday wardrobes. This moment also fits a wider fashion pattern in early 2026. Light-blue button-downs are showing up in style guides as versatile essentials for office and casual wear.Colour combinations like pale blue with chocolate brown are being touted as must-try seasonal pairings. Meghan has long embraced similar shirting pieces, reinforcing that timeless tailoring, especially shirts, remains central to polished and “quiet luxury” wardrobes.This is not just about one shirt. It shows how royal wardrobes can shape fashion trends globally. It marks a rare fashion overlap between two of the most watched public figures of the decade and highlights how quality basics, not only flashier pieces, can become cultural touchpoints.","The blue button-down, it seems, is having its royal renaissance as an icon of quintessential British style.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Million-Dirham Decisions Made Simple: The Tool Luxury Buyers in Dubai Are Quietly Using

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Dubai’s ultra-luxury property segment, including homes priced above Dh20 million, remains one of the hottest real estate markets globally, drawing affluent local and international investors alike. However, while listing volumes are high, identifying the right inventory with real market value and credibility can still be challenging.With hundreds of luxury transactions recorded annually, including more than 750 properties above Dh50m and over 250 valued above Dh100m in 2025 alone, the challenge for affluent buyers is not just seeing inventory but identifying the right opportunities backed by real market behaviour. Platforms like Bayut are simplifying this process with data-led tools, verified listings and specialist agent networks designed to empower discerning buyers.Instead of simply providing endless listings, Bayut focuses on three core pillars of data insights, verified availability and expert partnerships to help buyers separate signal from noise in a dynamic market environment.One of the biggest challenges for luxury buyers is knowing whether a listed price reflects actual market activity rather than wishful thinking.Bayut tackles this by offering transaction-backed insights, drawing on official Dubai Land Department (DLD) records, so that buyers can see what similar properties are really achieving in terms of sales volume and pricing.In 2025, Dubai recorded thousands of high-value property sales, including more than 750 transactions for properties above Dh50 million and over 250 above Dh100 million, underscoring both demand and the need for accurate context. This type of benchmark pricing helps buyers understand if a property is competitively priced, overpriced, or a rare value play — a crucial step before making multi-million-dirham commitments.Luxury real estate is not just about price tags, it is about deep market knowledge, negotiation experience and access to exclusive opportunities. Bayut’s ecosystem highlights specialist agents with proven track records in high-value transactions, rather than generalists who may be active across all segments.Programs like TruBroker, Bayut’s quality standard for agent credibility, help buyers identify intermediaries who are consistent, data-savvy and focused on premium markets. This makes it easier to form partnerships with professionals who understand how to position offers, anticipate buyer preferences and secure coveted properties.Luxury inventory, especially at the very top end, can be distorted by outdated listings, duplicate posts or units that are no longer available. Bayut’s technology emphasises verified listings through tools like TruCheck and cross-referencing with systems like DLD’s Madmoun to ensure that a property you’re considering is truly active and not a relic of old marketing efforts.This verification helps buyers avoid wasted time and misaligned expectations, accelerating decision-making and reducing friction in negotiations.Luxury buyers also benefit from tools that help them evaluate whether asking prices make sense relative to market benchmarks. Bayut’s TruEstimate offers valuation estimates, historical price movement analysis and demand indicators that serve as a sense check for where a property stands, helping buyers discern possible overpricing or hidden opportunity without removing the emotional appeal of design or location.Such analytical signals are especially valuable in a segment where architectural uniqueness or waterfront views can command premium pricing that may not be immediately intuitive.High-end property purchases often emerge from long-term observation rather than last-minute decisions. Features like portfolio tracking (where buyers can keep an eye on pricing trends, status shifts and comparisons across multiple shortlisted properties), give investors a structured way to monitor the market over time, rather than making impulsive choices.This kind of forward-looking visibility keeps serious buyers informed about pricing shifts, new inventory that enters the high-end space, and when timing might be right to make a move. As Dubai continues to attract wealthy buyers from Europe, Asia and the Gulf with significant activity in places like Palm Jumeirah, Dubai Hills Estate and Mohammed Bin Rashid City, the need for clarity and confidence in property selection has never been greater.Bayut’s combination of transaction-backed data, verification, specialist networks and valuation insights positions it not just as a listing portal but as a trusted guide through one of the world’s most dynamic luxury markets. In an era where information overload can mislead as easily as it informs, access to accurate data, specialised expertise and transparent tools helps buyers make smarter and more efficient decisions, whether they are picking a trophy asset or a strategic long-term investment.","Dubai’s ultra-luxury property segment, including homes priced above Dh20 million, remains one of the hottest real estate markets globally.

A father who looked away,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/a-father-who-looked-away/articleshow/128634567.cms,"By: Rishi Raj Singh

Recently, three sisters aged 16, 14, and 8 died by suicide in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. Reports suggest that the girls had developed a strong interest in Korean movies, music and dramas and were spending long hours on their mobile phones. Their father had bought them the devices but was reportedly not monitoring their use or their schooling.A few days before their deaths, the father forcibly took away the phones and sold them. Distressed by this, the girls allegedly left behind a note and jumped from a building, according to the police’s preliminary investigation.Mental health experts point out that addiction in children— whether to mobile phones or substanc-es—often develops in stages. It typically begins with access to a device, followed by growing interest in social media, reels, and chats. Over time, this can turn into a daily compulsion. In the next stage, denial of access may lead to anxiety, irritability, or aggression. In extreme cases, prolonged dependency can contribute to depression and suicidal thoughts, requiring urgent intervention.Under Section 108 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, abetment of suicide— including acts of assistance, instigation, or the creation of circumstances that may drive a person to take their own life—is punishable with imprisonment of up to 10 years along with a fine.In my opinion, investigating agencies should examine whether the father’s actions in this case attract provisions in connection with the deaths of the three girls.Psychologists note that individuals can be directly or indirectly linked to circumstances that lead to suicide, especially in cases involving minors who depend on parental guidance and supervision.Under the Parental Accountability and Responsibility Act, granting children unrestricted access to phones without regard for their age constitutes an offence. It is a parent’s fundamental duty to provide educational guidance—a duty that went unfulfilled here. The phone was handed over merely to keep the children occupied; its misuse was left unaddressed. Even after recognizing the girls’ growing obsession with Korean entertainment, the father took no corrective action. Rather than seeking professional help, he chose to sell the phone — a decision that, in the end, led to their deaths.The first step is educating children about the consequences of mobile addiction. If that proves insufficient, professional counselling should follow. Experts believe children turn to phones as an escape when their desires, expectations, and dreams go unfulfilled — and that addressing those unmet needs is the most effective way to loosen the grip of digital dependency. When children find joy in play, in sport, or in the bonds formed in a classroom, the brain’s own reward chemicals— dopamine and endorphins—do the rest.In this case, the parent provided none of those opportunities. Any parent who notices signs of illness or distress in their child would ordinarily seek help without hesitation — and living near Delhi, access to such resources was hardly an obstacle. The father had the means, the proximity, and the chance to save three lives. He simply did not make the time.In 2024, two parents in the US were sentenced to 15 years in prison under the Parental Accountability Act. James and Jennifer Crumbley had gifted their teenage son a firearm for his birthday. While gun ownership is not uncommon there, they failed to monitor how he used it. When the boy began drawing disturbing images of school shootings, teachers alerted the parents and urged them to seek psychiatric help. The warning went unheeded. The child went on to shoot four classmates — and ended up in a juvenile facility, while his parents were sent to adult prison.The Ghaziabad case must be viewed through a similar lens. The father’s conduct deserves serious scrutiny under the Parental Accountability Act. By providing the children with mobile phones without monitoring their use, failing to address signs of deepening addiction, he set in motion a chain of events that ended in three deaths. Holding him accountable for abetment is not merely about justice in this instance—it is a necessary warning to every parent who might otherwise make the same mistakes.","Three sisters aged 16, 14, and 8 died by suicide in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. Reports suggest that the girls had developed a strong interest in Korean movies, music and dramas. Their father had bought them the devices but was reportedly not monitoring their use or their schooling.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128634589,imgsize-22028,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/psychologists-note-that-individuals-can-be-directly-or-indirectly-linked-to-circumstances-that-lead-to-suicide-especially-in-cases-involving-minors-who-depend-on-parental-guidance-and-supervision.jpg"

What Meta said about shifting Horizon Worlds' focus from VR to mobile



Meta is changing its metaverse strategy once again. The social media giant is now making a major change to the Horizon Worlds VR-exclusive app, originally designed for Meta Quest headsets. Meta said it will separate its Quest VR ecosystem from the free, social 3D virtual experience and shift its focus largely to mobile users to compete with Roblox and Fortnite.This comes after the company laid off about 10% of its Reality Labs division, closed three VR studios, stopped new content for the VR fitness app Supernatural, and discontinued its metaverse platform for work. In 2021, the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg also changed the company’s name, and last year, Meta’s Reality Labs lost $20 billion.In a blog post, Samantha Ryan, Reality Labs’ VP of content, said Meta is “explicitly separating” its “Quest VR platform from our Worlds platform” and “shifting the focus of Worlds to be almost exclusively mobile.”Horizon Worlds was originally launched for VR, but the company now plans to compete more directly with platforms like Roblox and Fortnite that offer user-generated experiences on smartphones.Ryan said, ""To truly change the game and tap into a much larger market, we’re going all-in on mobile.”“We’re in a strong position to deliver synchronous social games at scale, thanks to our unique ability to connect those games with billions of people on the world’s biggest social networks. You saw this strategy start to unfold in 2025, and now, it’s our main focus,” she noted.She even added that Meta will prioritise support for third-party developers in VR.“While we’re proud of the world-class work from Oculus Studios over the years, among 1P and 3P apps, 86% of the effective time people spend in their VR headsets is with third-party apps,” she said, underscoring the company’s shift in emphasis within its Reality Labs division.What we know about Meta VR hardware's futureMeta said it will continue developing VR hardware despite the strategic shift. “We have a robust roadmap of future VR headsets that will be tailored to different audience segments as the market grows and matures,” Ryan said, adding that upcoming devices, which could include a new mainline Quest headset, may come at a higher price point.Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth also discussed the company’s evolving approach in a recent episode of the Access podcast.Following its earlier push into the metaverse, Zuckerberg has increasingly positioned AI as central to the company’s future social platforms. The approach could include AI-generated games that users can create and share through their social feeds.“There are 3D versions of that, and there are 2D versions of that and Horizon, I think, fits very well with the kind of immersive 3D version of that,” Zuckerberg said during the company’s latest earnings call.","Horizon Worlds was originally launched for VR, but the company now plans to compete more directly with platforms like Roblox and Fortnite.

Common methods of used to infect ATMs

How ATM malware works

What are the Physical Indicators of an infected ATM

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has released a flash to disseminate indicators of compromise (IOCs) and technical details associated with malware enabled ATM jackpotting. Threat actors exploitphysical and software vulnerabilities in ATMs and deploy malware to dispense cash without a legitimate transaction. The FBI has observed an increase in ATM jackpotting incidents across the United States. Out of 1,900 ATM jackpotting incidents reported since 2020, over 700 of them with more than $20 million in losses occurred in 2025 alone. This FLASH is being provided to encourage organizations to implement the recommended mitigation steps and to outline the information requested from the public.Threat actors are deploying ATM jackpotting malware, including the Ploutus family malware, to infect ATMs and force them to dispense cash. Ploutus malware exploits the eXtensions for Financial Services (XFS), the layer of software that instructs an ATM what to physically do. When a legitimate transaction occurs, the ATM application sends instructions through XFS for bank authorization. If a threat actor can issue their own commands to XFS, they can bypass bank authorization entirely and instruct the ATM to dispense cash on demand.As a result, Ploutus allows threat actors to force an ATM to dispense cash without using a bank card, customer account, or bank authorization. Once Ploutus is installed on an ATM, it gives threat actors direct control over the machine, allowing them to trigger cash withdrawals. Ploutus attacks the ATM itself rather than customer accounts, enabling fast cash-out operations that can occur in minutes and are often difficult to detect until after the money is withdrawn.After gaining access to ATMs, most often by opening an ATM face with widely available generic keys, ATM jackpotting threat actors have used several main methods to deploy malware:• Criminals remove the ATM’s hard drive, connect it to their computer, copy the malware to the hard drive, return the hard drive to the ATM, and reboot the ATM.• Criminals remove the ATM’s hard drive, replace it with a foreign hard drive or other external device with preloaded malware, and reboot the ATM.The malware interacts directly with the ATM hardware, bypassing any communications or security of the original ATM software. The malware does not require connection to an actual bank customer account todispense cash. The malware can be used across ATMs of different manufacturers with very little adjustment to the code as the Windows operating system is exploited during the compromise.* ATM door open alerts outside of planned maintenance schedule* Low/No cash indicators outside of expected use schedule* Unauthorized devices plugged into the ATM* Removal of hard drives from ATMs* ATM unexpectedly out of service","Threat actors are deploying ATM jackpotting malware, including the Ploutus family malware, to infect ATMs and force them to dispense cash.

Price spikes and “RAMmageddon”



Industry fallout due to global chip crisis



Echoes of past supply chain shocks



Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Xiaomi President Lu Weibing and many others are warning about a global crisis unfolding: Shortage of memory chips. The scarcity of memory chips led to their soaring costs. As a report in Bloomberg says it is beginning to hammer profits, derail corporate plans and inflate price tags on everything from laptops and smartphones to automobiles and data centers — and the crunch is only going to get worse.As per the Bloomberg report, the main driver of the squeeze is the buildout of AI data centers. Companies like Alphabet and OpenAI are buying millions of Nvidia AI accelerators, each needing a massive amounts of DRAM. This has left the consumer electronics maker fighting over dwindling supplies from Samsung and Micron. Elon Musk has also suggested that Tesla may need to build its own fabrication plant, “he said in January.The report also adds that the memory prices are increasing and going at an unprecedented levels. One of the type of DRAM jumped by 75% in a single month, with retailers adjusting prices daily. Industry insiders have dubbed the crisis “RAMmageddon.” Tim Cook warned that iPhone margins will be compressed, while Micron called the bottleneck “unprecedented.”The report also revealed the industry fallout on the global chip crisis.The report adds that Sony may delay its next PlayStation console to 2028 or 2029. Also, Nintendo is also thinking raising the prices of Switch 2. Xiaomi and Oppo may also cut shipment forecasts for 2026. Cisco cited the memory squeeze in a weak profit outlook, triggering its worst share loss in nearly four years. Lastly, Qualcomm and Arm Holdings also warned of more fallout.This global chip crisis recall the Covid-era chip shortages, but this time the driver is AI. Tech giants Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Google are pouring hundreds of billions into AI infrastructure, diverting memory production toward high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for AI accelerators. That leaves less capacity for standard DRAM used in everyday electronics.Bernstein’s Mark Li says memory prices are going “parabolic.” Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing warned the crunch will last at least through the year. Counterpoint Research estimates DRAM shortages will persist across electronics, telecom, and automotive industries, with signs of panic buying already visible.",Report: Shortage of memory chips led to soaring costs.

Google responds to the lawsuit

Popular radio show host David Greene has sued Google , alleging the tech giant of ‘stealing’ his voice for its NotebookLM tool, which uses AI to create on-demand podcasts. The lawsuit, filed in Santa Clara County alleges that Google cloned Greene’s voice and distinctive broadcasting style without permission or compensation. Greene argues that Google’s NotebookLM T tool voice's rhythm, intonation, and even his characteristic verbal tics are so similar that even his friends, colleagues, and listeners assumed he'd licensed his voice to Google.“So... I’m probably the 148th person to ask this, but did you license your voice to Google? It sounds very much like you!,” a former co-worker asked David Greene in a fall 2024 email, a Washington Post report says.“I was, like, completely freaked out,” Greene told the publication, adding “It’s this eerie moment where you feel like you’re listening to yourself.”Greene said the AI voice sounds very similar to his own, and that the impact goes beyond losing a chance to make money from his best-known asset. “My voice is, like, the most important part of who I am,” Greene reportedly said.In the lawsuit, Greene’s lawyer argues that the recordings make the resemblance clear.“We have faith in the court and encourage people to listen to the example audio themselves,” said Joshua Michelangelo Stein, a partner at the firm Boies Schiller Flexner.Google responded denying the allegations. Google spokesperson José Castañeda told Washington Post: “These allegations are baseless. The sound of the male voice in NotebookLM’s Audio Overviews is based on a paid professional actor Google hired.”The Washington Post reported, “The lawsuit is the latest to pit the rights of individual human creators against the rights of a burgeoning AI industry that promises to transform the economy by enabling the on-demand generation of stunningly lifelike speech, prose, images, and video. Behind the artificial voices found in tools like NotebookLM are language models trained on vast libraries of real-life human text and speech. The humans used to train these models are unaware that their words and voices will be used by AI, raising serious questions about copyright and ownership.”","Popular radio show host David Greene has sued Google, alleging the tech giant of ‘stealing’ his voice for its NotebookLM tool, which uses AI to create on-demand podcasts.

Connectivity beyond the vehicle



Smart devices empowering smart living

Scaling the ecosystem

India’s consumer technology landscape is entering a decisive new phase, defined not just by isolated devices, but by intelligent, seamlessly interconnected ecosystems that touch every part of modern life. This shift is being accelerated by India’s rapid digital transformation, where connected IoT devices are expected to represent a $35 billion market by 2030. Increasingly, value is no longer created by individual products alone, but by how seamlessly they work together to deliver integrated, intuitive experiences.At the same time, today’s digitally mature consumers expect much more than incremental improvements on specsheets. They seek holistic experiences that span work, mobility, entertainment, health, payments, and their homes, demonstrating how digital technologies have become deeply embedded in everyday behaviour and interactions.India’s tablet market rebounded by 33% quarter-on-quarter Q3 2025. LED TVs with screen sizes above 55” continue to gain increasing traction among customers. There is a visible shift towards premium, high-performance devices across categories, from smartphones and tablets to large-screen TVs and wearables, signalling a clear transition from volume-led adoption to value-driven choices.More importantly, this isn’t just about purchasing more devices but about building a portfolio of products that work together to deliver one seamless user experience.Within a single ecosystem, consumers can now move effortlessly across entertainment, health, payments, work, and mobility. A movie started on a smart TV continues on a tablet, fitness insights from a wearable sync instantly with health apps, digital wallets integrate smoothly across devices, and work files remain accessible across screens. This continuity allows one user, through one ecosystem, to stay connected to every part of their digital life without disruption, turning multiple devices into one unified experience.At the heart of this transformation lies the growth of the unified device service ecosystem, where the entire tech ecosystem operates as a unified network, each reinforcing the other to deliver a more intuitive, responsive, and personalised digital experience. With globalIoT connections reaching 19.8 billion in 2025, the demand for seamless is accelerating, and this shift is being fueled by several powerful forces.First, ubiquitous connectivity has made real-time interaction between devices an expectation, with users seeking uninterrupted access to their digital world at home, at work, and on the move. Second, greater accessibility to information and services has turned devices into gateways for productivity, communication, entertainment, and commerce from anywhere. Lastly, evolving behavioural patterns are also reshaping technology use, as consumers juggle multiple roles across work, health, and personal life. Ecosystems reduce the cognitive load of constant context-switching, enabling seamless multitasking without the fear of missing out. This is paired with a growing demand for convenience without compromise, users expect devices to sync effortlessly while still delivering high performance across scenarios.Together, these forces are shifting focus from standalone device capabilities to ecosystem intelligence. For brands, future success will depend less on individual specifications and more on how seamlessly products integrate, learn from user behaviour, and deliver consistent cross-device experiences. The winners will be those that build not just devices, but adaptive ecosystems that move with the rhythm of everyday life.Connectivity and ecosystem intelligence are the backbone of this transformation. 5G and software/OS adoption is mainstream, with nearly 90% of smartphone shipments in India now supporting 5G, including affordable segments. Smartphones and tablets have evolved into intelligent command centres, orchestrating IoT-enabled appliances, wearables, and energy systems, ensuring continuity across notifications, media, and daily routines. This shift from standalone connectivity to ecosystem intelligence is redefining convenience, efficiency, and everyday digital experiences for Indian consumers.The wearables market also continues to grow, now anticipating user needs and enhancing their lifestyle by offering implementable changes and providing real-time insights based on biometric data. Interconnectivity with other devices enables them to act as substitutes for more complex devices, enabling simple tasks on the fly. Machine learning helps further optimize user experience over time through the collected data.The automotive space has been integrated into the tech ecosystem as well. Smartphones are now equipped with smart controls, automatic key locks, infotainment operability, driver assist safety and parking systems along with connected features such as geo tagging and fencing, remote diagnostics and over the web software updates for the vehicle beyond basic utility features.Smart cars have become entities that are connected on multiple channels (such as Vehicle to Vehicle, Vehicle to Infrastructure, Vehicle to Pedestrian and Vehicle to Cloud), sharing real time data to enhance safety, convenience features and overall user experience on the road. Such interoperability has resulted in increasing collaborations between the two sectors, with the resulting innovations transforming both automotive and consumer tech experiences.Home appliances and security systems are now integrated across devices and can be operated remotely. TVs and tablets serve as multi-user “family screens” with adaptive interfaces and stylus input. Smart displays adapt multi-user interfaces dynamically, prioritizing notifications, content, and device functions per user profile. Interconnectivity of Appliances, home security, and energy management are managed through a common device through voice and gesture interfaces enabling intuitive control. Cross-device AI reasoning ensures consistent, seamless, and contextually relevant experiences across the ecosystem, creating a truly connected lifestyle.Availability and accessibility is critical in scaling ecosystem engagement. The distribution network helps create product awareness and increases customer inquiries which directly correlates to sales. Offline and online retail channels contribute roughly equally to adoption. Finally, aftermarket support is the deciding factor that builds trust in the brand and promotes ecosystem growth. Service centres, rapid repair networks, and predictive maintenance systems reinforce trust and device longevity. Faster service times and easier accessibility to remote diagnostics and over the web vehicle service, ensures that ecosystem devices remain reliable and accessible over time. This reliability drives consumer confidence and encourages deeper cross platform integration in daily life.The trajectory is clear: Indian consumers are prioritizing devices that enhance lifestyle, improve health monitoring, and integrate seamlessly into their homes and routines. The ecosystem approach, powered by next-generation connectivity, automation in devices, improved processing powers, and comprehensive aftermarket support, is not just reshaping technology adoption—it is defining the future of connected living in India.","India’s tablet market rebounded by 33% quarter-on-quarter Q3 2025.
