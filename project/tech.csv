NIA Arrests Alleged Aide Of ‘Suicide Bomber’ Umar Nabi In Delhi Terror Attack

NEW DELHI: Investigators probing the November 10 suicide bombing near Red Fort — which killed 15 people — are still trying to answer three central questions:Investigators believe the first puzzle may be closer to an answer.A key line of inquiry suggests Umar might have assembled or finalised the improvised explosive device at a parking area near Old Delhi’s Sunehri Masjid.The theory is backed by a precise CCTV trail that shows him driving into the parking lot at 3.19pm and leaving at 6.28pm, spending more than three hours there. The blast took place nearby at 6.52pm.The second question — how the blast was triggered — is expected to be clarified once the National Security Guard and forensic teams submit their detailed explosive analysis report, which will then be matched with other probe findings.The third question, regarding communication with a handler, hinges on the analysis of internet protocol detail records and dump data.Investigators have identified around 70 active anomalous numbers and are examining whether any of them were in touch with numbers traced to Turkiye or Afghanistan, sources said.Parallel to this, police are reviewing designs and materials recovered in connection with the module’s broader plans to use drones and small rockets for future attacks. Umar and his associate Dr Muzammil Shakeel — who later fell out with him over money — had allegedly tasked their accomplice, Jasir alias Danish, with preparing drones fitted with cameras and explosives for reconnaissance and the blast itself.The group was also exploring the use of Hamas-style gliding rockets.The NIA is currently interrogating two arrested suspects — Jasir and car owner Amir — as the probe widens to uncover the full scope of the module’s operations.",Investigators believe the first puzzle may be closer to an answer.

"Roblox implements new age verification for chat features: What the new facial age checks mean for kids, parents and moderators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/roblox-implements-new-age-verification-for-chat-features-what-the-new-facial-age-checks-mean-for-kids-parents-and-moderators/articleshow/125434327.cms,"Roblox implements new age verification for chat features

New Roblox rules : Age verification required for chat features



Roblox chat age checks start in select countries in December



How Roblox’s facial age-estimation technology estimates your age



Who can chat with whom on Roblox: Age brackets and rules



Roblox’s privacy and safety: New policies for chat and moderation



Why Roblox says it is doing this now



Related FAQs for parents and users



Do children lose all chat features?

Children under 13 will be restricted from most chats with adults and older teens by default; under-9 chat is off unless a parent consents after verification. Peer-to-peer chat among similar-aged users remains possible depending on the age bracket.

What if the age check is wrong?

Roblox says users can appeal an age estimate by providing a government ID or obtaining parental verification; the company has described a 48-hour window to verify if someone believes they were misclassified. Reported flows vary by market.

Will the selfie or ID be stored?

Roblox has stated that the selfie used for age estimation will not be stored; the company also offers ID-based verification, wherea government ID is submitted and processed under privacy safeguards. Independent privacy reviews have been requested by advocates.

Are private chats still monitored?

Yes, Roblox currently does not use end-to-end encryption for private chats, enabling automated and human moderation to detect abuse and policy violations. The company says this monitoring will continue and is a key part of its safety controls.





Roblox, the global online game and social platform with more than 150 million daily users, has announced a major update to how users can communicate: a new age-based chat system that uses facial age-estimation and other age-verification methods to limit conversations between children and much older users. The company says the change prompted by lawsuits and growing scrutiny of child safety online will place users into narrow age cohorts (for example: under 9, 9–12, 13–15, 16–17, 18–20 and 21+) and block most cross-age private chats unless specific trust or parental-consent steps are taken. Roblox frames the move as a new industry safety standard and plans a phased rollout starting in December 2025 (pilot markets) with global enforcement in January 2026. The following article explains what Roblox will do, how the technology works, what alternatives exist, and what experts, advocates and parents have said so far, strictly reporting facts and official claims with up-to-date sourcing.Roblox will require users who want to use private messaging and certain chat features to complete an age check. The platform will estimate a user’s age using a live selfie video processed by a third-party age-estimation provider (Persona), or users can verify age with a government ID or parental consent where required.Based on that estimate or verification, Roblox assigns an age bracket and allows chat only with users in the same or nearby brackets. Under-9 accounts will have chat turned off by default unless a parent provides permission after verification. Roblox says images used for the facial check will not be stored.Roblox is starting the new system with a voluntary age-check period immediately and will enforce mandatory age checks in phases. The company has said it will begin the first enforced rollouts in December 2025 in countries including Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, followed by a broader, global enforcement in January 2026 for markets where chat features are available. Users will see in-app prompts to verify age; those who decline may lose access to some communication features.Roblox’s public explanation is that the platform will use a vendor-supplied algorithm to estimate age from a short live selfie video. Roblox executives say the system is calibrated to estimate ages roughly between 5 and 25 with an accuracy window of about one to two years; the company also offers alternatives such as uploading a government ID or using parental verification if a user disputes an estimate. The live selfie flow is intended to detect “liveness” (a real person) and to avoid spoofing with photos. Roblox has emphasised that the selfie is analysed and the platform does not retain the raw image, though privacy advocates note that implementation details matter for trust.Roblox will place accounts into defined age buckets (reported examples: under-9, 9–12, 13–15, 16–17, 18–20, 21+). Chat permissions are then limited so younger users cannot initiate or sustain conversations with significantly older users. For example, a pre-teen placed in the 9–12 group would be prevented from privately messaging users assigned to the 18–20 or 21+ cohorts, unless those relationships are converted into “trusted connections” (which require additional verification, such as confirming a real-world relationship). Roblox says the policy aims to reduce the possibility of adults posing as peers to groom minors.Roblox points out that private chats on the platform are not end-to-end encrypted, which means the platform can scan and moderate messages for policy violations; the company says this ability remains essential for child protection. Roblox also says the age checks will be paired with automated detection systems, human moderation and abuse-reporting tools. The policy updates are part of a broader safety push after lawsuits and media reports alleging that predators used the platform to contact minors.Roblox cites a wave of lawsuits and heightened regulatory scrutiny as a reason to strengthen age-assurance and limit adult-minor communications. The company frames the change as setting a new safety standard for interactive platforms, saying the technology and policies aim to reduce opportunities for grooming and exploitation while preserving legitimate social interactions among peers. Roblox’s safety team has published a company statement and blog post describing the rollout and the expected user experience.","Roblox will require users who want to use private messaging and certain chat features to complete an age check. The platform will estimate a user’s age using a live selfie video processed by a third-party age-estimation provider (Persona), or users can verify age with a government ID or parental consent where required.

Why Gemini 3 could be a problem for OpenAI





The branding battle





Google has launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model as “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding. ” As reported by Business Insider, analysts are calling launch of Gemini 3 as the most aggressive move made by Google against OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The launch of Gemini 3 makers a turning point in the AI race, as Google integrates Gemini 3 directly into Google Search from day one, allowing users to access the model instantly via an “AI mode” toggle — no separate app or download required.Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations. However, the real disruption lies in its distribution strategy:This end-to-end control means Google can scale Gemini faster and more efficiently than rivals who rely on external partnerships.OpenAI’s ChatGPT is still one of the most popular AI chatbot globally, but it has a limited ecosystem. It depends on partners for chips, cloud infrastructure, and distribution, whereas Google owns the entire pipeline. Google DeepMind CTO Koray Kavukcuoglu emphasized this edge, “One of the most important things for us at Google is this is possible because we have a very differentiated full-stack approach.” With Gemini 3, Google is positioning itself as not just a competitor, but a direct alternative to ChatGPT across everyday search and productivity tools.Despite Google’s technical dominance, OpenAI still holds a crucial advantage: brand recognition. “ChatGPT” has become shorthand for AI in the public imagination, much like “Google” became synonymous with search.Analysts say Google has time — and money — to change that. With Gemini 3 offered free in some cases, Google could undercut rivals on price and flood the market with its model. Bernstein analyst Mark Schmulik told BI, “There’s no debate that Google has all the technical intangibles across the stack… but we need HARD evidence that they’re putting this all together. With Gemini 3, we may have just gotten some.”Gemini 3 signals Google’s full-throttle entry into the AI arms race, leveraging its infrastructure, apps, and financial muscle to challenge OpenAI’s dominance.","Gemini 3 signals Google’s full-throttle entry into the AI arms race, leveraging its infrastructure, apps, and financial muscle.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

“Tommy just lost 50% of his supporters with this one move!”

“Nick Fuentes defends extremism abroad while aiming at the wrong targets at home.”

“Fuentes is a Qatari-backed spy-op sent to split the movement — wake up!”

“Shouldn’t you be focusing on England instead of picking fights online?”

“He’s part of the very system he claims to fight against.”

“Fuentes has answered the January 6 question countless times — stop trying to paint him as a fed.”

“Your constant alignment with Israel is hurting your own cause — this isn’t helping you.”





A new online dispute has broken out between Tommy Robinson and American commentator Nick Fuentes, after Fuentes referred to Robinson as a “Zionist tool” in a circulating clip. The video, shared widely across X, shows Fuentes accusing Robinson of being used to provoke clashes in Britain and to undermine pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Robinson responded publicly, dismissing Fuentes’ claims and questioning his understanding of issues involving Muslim communities in the UK. He also accused Fuentes of commenting on situations he has never experienced firsthand, framing the criticism as detached from British social realities.The exchange began when Fuentes, speaking in a video shared on social media, accused Robinson of being used to provoke confrontations in Britain and to undermine pro-Palestinian demonstrations.

UAE introduces needle-free nasal spray flu vaccine; quick and painless protection for ages 2 to 49,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-introduces-needle-free-nasal-spray-flu-vaccine-quick-and-painless-protection-for-ages-2-to-49/articleshow/125407535.cms,"UAE launches new nasal flu vaccine for residents / AI-Generated Image

UAE's new Nasal Spray flu vaccine

How the Nasal Spray works

Comparison Nasal Spray Vaccine (LAIV) Injectable Flu Shot (IIV) Technology Uses a live attenuated (weakened) virus Uses inactivated (dead) virus or viral components Administration Needle-free nasal spray (one puff per nostril) Injection into the muscle Immunity Focus Boosts mucosal and systemic immunity Boosts systemic (blood) immunity Key Advantage Ideal for those with needle anxiety; quick & painless Suitable for all ages and high-risk groups

Who is eligible?

Healthy children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years.

Healthy adults aged 18 to 49 years.

Who must avoid the Nasal Mist?

Children under 2 years old: They face an increased risk of wheezing or respiratory distress.

Adults aged 50 years and above: Safety and efficacy have not been established for this age group.

Pregnant Women: The injectable shot is the approved and recommended option during pregnancy.

Individuals with Weakened Immune Systems: This includes people with conditions like HIV, active cancer, or those undergoing chemotherapy or taking high-dose immunosuppressive drugs.

People with Severe Asthma or Current Wheezing: This contraindication is critical, especially for children.

Close Contacts of Severely Immunocompromised People: If someone in your home has a condition requiring isolation (like a recent transplant), you should ideally use the inactivated (injectable) vaccine.

Availability





Great news for anyone who dreads needles! The UAE's Ministry of Health and Prevention (MOHAP) has officially rolled out the country's first-ever influenza vaccine delivered as a nasal spray, marking a major step forward in expanding safe and easy immunisation options. This new, needle-free mist is specifically approved for healthy residents between the ages of 2 and 49, offering a quick, pain-free alternative to the traditional flu shot.The annual race to get a flu shot just became a lot easier, and completely needle-free, for millions of UAE residents. In a major health advancement, the Ministry of Health and Prevention (MOHAP) has introduced a new influenza vaccine optionally delivered as a nasal spray, marking the first time this innovative option has been officially registered and rolled out nationwide in the country.This development is part of the UAE’s strategic push to expand safe immunisation options, boost overall vaccine coverage, and strengthen the community’s defence against seasonal viruses. This simple mist, known commercially as FluMist Quadrivalent (or Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine - LAIV), is a game-changer, especially for two key groups: children and anyone with a fear of injections.Forget the sting; this vaccine is an easy, single spray into each nostril.But how does a puff of mist protect you from the flu? The answer lies in its unique technology, which mimics a natural infection where the virus typically enters the body: the nose and throat.The weakened virus in the spray is ""cold-adapted"" and can only grow at the cooler temperatures found in the nasal cavity. It cannot thrive in the higher temperature of the lungs, making it safe and unable to cause the flu itself. By stimulating immunity right at the entry point, it builds powerful local protection and is proven to be highly effective, particularly in children.The new nasal spray is specifically approved for healthy individuals within a tight age bracket. If you fall outside of this range, or have certain underlying health conditions, you must opt for the traditional injectable shot.The nasal flu mist is exclusively for:The primary aim of the nasal mist is to provide an accessible and pain-free alternative. It is administered in a single dose (two sprays) per flu season for most people aged nine and older. Children aged two to eight who have never had a flu vaccine before may require two doses, spaced at least a month apart.Because the nasal spray uses a weakened live virus, it is not suitable for everyone. These six groups are strictly advised by MOHAP and global health authorities to avoid the nasal spray and receive the standard injectable flu shot instead:Important Allergy Alert: Anyone with a severe allergy to eggs, gelatin, gentamicin, arginine, or any other vaccine component, or who has had a severe allergic reaction to a previous flu vaccine, should not receive the nasal spray.Aspirin Warning: Children and adolescents (2-17 years old) who are currently taking aspirin or salicylate-containing medicines must also avoid the nasal mist due to the rare risk of developing Reye’s syndrome.The nasal spray vaccine is now available at selected public and private health facilities across the UAE. While the cost may vary depending on your provider and insurance coverage, some private centers are offering the dose for approximately AED 200. By adding this highly effective, non-invasive option, the UAE has made protecting yourself and your family from the flu season easier than ever. Always consult your healthcare provider to confirm your eligibility and ensure you choose the best vaccine option for your specific health profile.",UAE launches new nasal flu vaccine for residents.

Historic first crewed eVTOL flight in Dubai

The aircraft, speeds and where you’ll board?

Qatar’s quiet coup





Dubai has completed its first crewed electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) air-taxi flight, a short point-to-point journey being hailed as a milestone on the road to commercial air-taxi service in 2026.If you want the first visual, the Dubai Media Office video shows the aircraft lifting off at Margham and landing at DWC during the trials; it’s the clearest public footage of the crewed point-to-point run. Expect more test flights, phased certification steps and vertiport roll-outs through 2025–2026, ahead of the first commercial routes planned for 2026.On 16 November 2025, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), in partnership with Joby Aviation, completed the first crewed eVTOL flight between Margham and Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC), a point-to-point test that demonstrates vertical take-off, cruise and landing in an operational context. The RTA and Dubai Media Office released video and statements showing the short crewed journey as part of trials ahead of a planned 2026 launch. Watch the official clip from Dubai Media Office for the moment the aircraft lifted off and landed:[Also read: Dubai unveils 4 launch pads for Flying Taxis: Where you’ll catch the World’s first aerial taxi in 2026 Dubai’s air-taxi programme is built around the Joby Aviation S4 eVTOL, a quiet, all-electric aircraft with six rotors, four battery packs and a performance profile that allows speeds of up to 320 km/h and ranges of around 160 km per charge, making it ideal for fast city hops.Each aircraft will carry four passengers plus one pilot, offering a compact but premium cabin with panoramic windows and low noise levels compared to helicopters.To support the service, the RTA is developing a network of dedicated vertiports, starting with Dubai International Airport (DXB), Palm Jumeirah, Downtown Dubai and Dubai Marina, with the DXB hub already about 60% complete and designed to handle up to 170,000 passengers a year. These strategically chosen points are meant to slash travel times—for example, a 45-minute ground trip could take just 12 minutes by air. Watch the video for a close-up look at what the air taxi offers, inside and out:Although pricing is not final, early estimates suggest fares could sit around US$75, similar to a high-end ride-hailing service, with the long-term aim of becoming competitive with regular taxis. Joby has already completed hundreds of piloted test flights globally and holds exclusive operating rights in Dubai for six years, while passengers will eventually be able to book flights through a dedicated mobile app, with fast charging and quick turnarounds enabling frequent daily operations.Overall, the system is being built as a smooth, airport-style experience, compact vertiports, efficient boarding, pilot-operated flights and seamless links to the metro, buses and taxis, making air taxis feel less like futuristic experiments and more like an everyday transport option.Days before the Dubai spectacle, Qatar secured a different, but equally significant, victory by focusing on full autonomy. On November 15, 2025, the country celebrated the successful trial of its first-ever urban passenger flight with a fully unmanned eVTOL.The event was proudly sponsored and officially witnessed by H.E. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulla bin Mohammed Al Thani, the Minister of Transport (MoT). The aircraft operated entirely without any direct human interference, relying completely on a full self-control system enabled by AI and sophisticated advanced air navigation technologies. Remarkably, the pilotless taxi flew successfully between the Old Doha Port and the scenic Katara Cultural Village.This initiative is a core part of the MoT Strategy 2025-2030, which aims to create a smart, resilient transportation system to support Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV 2030) and reduce the nation's carbon footprint.","Dubai has completed its first crewed electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) air-taxi flight.

Qatar’s best view yet: The fastest annual meteor shower arrives Nov 17,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/qatars-best-view-yet-the-fastest-annual-meteor-shower-arrives-nov-17/articleshow/125377745.cms,"Leonid meteors streak across Qatar’s night sky tonight / AI-Generated Image

What are the Leonids?

When to watch?

Where to look for Meteors?

Maximizing your meteor hunt

Moon-Free Skies: The shower peaks when the Moon is in its waning crescent phase, meaning it will be only about 9 percent illuminated. This minimal moonlight translates to significantly darker skies, preventing light pollution from the Moon itself from washing out the fainter meteors.

Find the Dark: The most crucial tip for any meteor shower is to escape city lights. Find a secluded spot far away from all sources of light pollution (such as streetlights and residential areas). Your eyes need complete darkness to adjust fully.

Go Naked-Eye: You do not need any special equipment like telescopes or binoculars; these tools are too zoomed-in to capture the sweeping path of a meteor. All you need are your naked eyes and patience.

Allow Adjustment Time: Once you arrive at your dark location, allow your eyes a minimum of 20 to 30 minutes to fully adjust to the darkness. Any bright phone screen light will immediately reset this process.

Get Comfortable: Bring a comfortable chair or blanket. Meteor viewing is a waiting game, so lie back with your feet pointing generally toward the east/northeast and scan the entire expanse of the sky.





Get ready to ditch the city lights and look up! The celestial event of the month, the Leonid meteor shower, is about to light up the sky, peaking on the night of November 16-17, 2025. These dazzling ""shooting stars"" are renowned as some of the fastest in the cosmos, created as Earth streaks through the dusty trail left by Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle.Because this year features excellent, moon-free conditions and the potential for up to 40 meteors per hour, now is your chance to witness the natural fireworks. Read on for your simple, step-by-step guide on the best time to look up, where to point your gaze, and how to maximize your viewing success.The origin of these meteors is the tiny, dusty trail left behind by Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle. As Earth orbits the Sun each November, it passes directly through this debris field. The specks of dust, most smaller than a grain of sand, vaporize upon atmospheric entry, creating the flash we observe from the ground. While typically producing a modest display, the Leonids are famously known for their meteor storms—intense periods where thousands of meteors can fall per hour, a spectacular event that occurs roughly every 33 years, coinciding with the comet’s orbital period. While 2025 is not a storm year, conditions promise excellent visibility.Astro-observers predict the shower’s peak around 18:00 UTC on 17 November 2025, that converts to 21:00 (9:00 pm) on 17 November in Qatar (UTC+3). Even so, the best practical viewing is after midnight and into the pre-dawn hours, when the Leo radiant climbs higher and more of the sky is favourable. Expect about 10–15 meteors per hour under good, dark skies (some sources give up to ~15–20/hour as a generous peak estimate).The Leonid meteor shower is active annually from around November 6 until November 30, but the best viewing opportunity, the peak, occurs on the night between November 16 and 17, 2025. The absolute ideal time to watch is after midnight until the pre-dawn hours on the morning of November 17, when the meteor shower's radiant point is highest in the sky.The meteors appear to originate from the constellation Leo the Lion (hence the name Leonids), which rises in the east/northeast after midnight. While they seem to stream from Leo, viewers are advised to look 30 to 40 degrees away from the radiant. Looking away from Leo allows you to catch the meteors streaking across a wider section of the sky, maximizing the chance of seeing longer, more dramatic trails.Globally, rates are expected to be around 10 to 15 meteors per hour (ZHR). However, local astronomical experts have suggested the rate could reach up to 40 meteors per hour in exceptionally dark viewing locations, providing the potential for a significantly better display.This year presents a particularly favorable chance to view the Leonids, primarily due to the state of the Moon.As the Leonids sweep across Qatar’s sky on November 17, this is your once-a-year chance to slow down, look up, and enjoy a natural light show that needs nothing more than clear skies and a little patience. Whether you're watching from the desert, the coastline, or your rooftop, the night promises a mix of calm, wonder, and those brief streaks of magic that remind us how alive the sky really is. Enjoy the moment, the Leonids are here, and they’re worth staying up for.","The Leonid meteor shower is active annually from around November 6 until November 30.

Shah Rukh Khan Grooves To ‘Chaiyya Chaiyya’ With Farah Khan, Sets Internet On Fire!

Tower’s spectacular features





Dubai developer Danube Group has launched Shahrukhz by Danube, a premium commercial tower on Sheikh Zayed Road that will carry Shah Rukh Khan ’s name and a life-size statue of the star at its entrance. The project, unveiled at a Mumbai event with Danube founder Rizwan Sajan and Shah Rukh Khan, is positioned as a landmark commercial address and is expected to be completed in the next 3–4 years.Shahrukhz (styled as Shahrukhz by Danube) is being promoted as a premium commercial and lifestyle tower on Sheikh Zayed Road, Dubai’s main business artery. Reports list it as a 55–56 storey development with more than one million sq ft of built-up space, a helipad, over 40 amenities (sky pool, business lounges, valet, etc.), and a life-size statue of Shah Rukh Khan in his signature open-arms pose at the entrance. The builder's marketing and press coverage place the finish date around 2029, a roughly three-to-four-year timeline.The newly unveiled skyscraper is more than just a name; it’s a massive commercial development positioned at a prime location. The building sits directly on Sheikh Zayed Road, Dubai's main arterial corridor. The project carries a gross saleable value of approximately ₹4,000 crore (over $480 million) and will span more than 1 million square feet of built-up space.Marketed as a premium, Grade-A commercial destination, the tower stands 55 or 56 storeys tall.This landmark development is intended to be affordable for new businesses in Dubai, with commercial units starting at around $460,000. Construction is underway, and the developers are targeting a completion date by the second quarter of 2029.Danube Group is one of the UAE’s most recognisable home-grown business success stories, and the company behind the newly announced Shahrukhz tower. The group was founded in 1993 by Rizwan Sajan, an Indian-origin entrepreneur who arrived in Dubai with modest beginnings and grew a small trading shop into a multi-industry powerhouse.Over three decades, Sajan expanded Danube from a building-materials supplier into a diversified conglomerate with operations across the Middle East and Asia. His leadership style is often described as hands-on, ambitious and deeply relationship-driven, which has helped Danube build long-standing trust among suppliers, customers and partners.Today, Danube Group operates several major verticals, including building materials, home interiors, hospitality, façade systems and real estate but its most high-profile public face is Danube Properties, the development arm behind this new Shah Rukh Khan-named tower. Because the company originally started in building materials, Danube has an unusually deep supply-chain advantage in construction, allowing it to manage cost, quality and delivery with tighter control than many competitors.The grand launch event took place not in Dubai, but in Mumbai, hosted by the developers to appeal to Indian investors. Superstar Shah Rukh Khan graced the stage, alongside Danube Chairman Rizwan Sajan and filmmaker Farah Khan. The actor became visibly emotional while reflecting on the milestone, noting that his late mother would have been ""very happy"" about the honour. He shared a personal connection, expressing pride that he could tell his children, ""Papa's name is written here, this is Papa's building. ""In classic SRK style, he entertained the audience by recreating his iconic open-arm pose, performing the ""Don walk,"" and delivering his famous 'Om Shanti Om' dialogue. He also joked about his rare public appearances, quipping, ""I’ve become like the Eid moon. I am rarely seen, but when I appear, I look good."" Khan revealed that he was drawn to the project because it resonated with the idea of supporting people who come to a city with dreams of building their businesses and lives.The ""Shahrukhz by Danube"" tower is designed to be a unique experience, blending luxury commercial space with a tourist attraction dedicated to the star. It will boast more than 40 premium amenities for its occupants. The most distinctive feature will be a life-size statue of Shah Rukh Khan in his signature open-arms pose, located prominently at the entrance.The developers envision this entrance becoming a must-visit tourist destination, much like fans flock outside SRK's Mumbai residence, Mannat. Furthermore, the building’s cutting-edge design includes a helipad and is even expected to feature an air taxi station, a nod to Dubai’s futuristic transit plans. Danube Properties has confirmed that the name ""Shahrukhz"" is guaranteed to remain with this specific tower in perpetuity.","Dubai developer Danube Group has launched Shahrukhz by Danube, a premium commercial tower on Sheikh Zayed Road.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets. The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

Meet Charlie Javice: Woman who scammed JP Morgan for $175M — but the bank is paying her $142M legal bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meet-charlie-javice-woman-who-scammed-jp-morgan-for-175m-but-the-bank-is-paying-her-142m-legal-bills/articleshow/125369591.cms,"How a startup deal turned into a massive fraud

A conviction that didn’t stop the bills

The controversial expenses

Why JPMorgan cannot simply stop paying

Charlie Javice’s story sounds almost too bizarre to be real: a young fintech founder who tricked JPMorgan into buying her startup for $175 million, ended up convicted of fraud, and is now serving a prison sentence, yet the same company she scammed is still paying more than $142 million for her legal bills, including questionable expenses like luxury hotel upgrades and “cellulite butter. ”Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid. When JPMorgan considered acquiring the startup in 2021, she reportedly presented the bank with millions of supposed student user accounts. Prosecutors later revealed that these numbers had been fabricated, with Javice allegedly hiring a data scientist to generate fake profiles to inflate Frank’s value.JPMorgan completed the acquisition believing Frank had more than four million users, only to discover after the deal that the platform had a tiny fraction of that. The bank alerted authorities, and by 2023 Javice was arrested on federal fraud charges.In March 2025, Javice was convicted of multiple fraud counts and sentenced to more than seven years in prison. But here’s where the story takes an unusual twist: despite defrauding the bank, she is still allowed to bill JPMorgan for her legal defence because of an indemnification clause included in the acquisition agreement.This contractual protection, which is common in startup buyouts, requires JPMorgan to cover certain legal costs for former executives of Frank.As a result, the bank has already paid over $142 million in defence expenses for Javice and her former colleague Olivier Amar.The clause itself is a standard feature in mergers, designed to protect executives from being financially ruined by lawsuits connected to their time at the company. In normal situations, it is meant to ensure fairness and prevent frivolous legal targeting after an acquisition. But in this case, it has trapped JPMorgan in a bizarre obligation: they must keep funding the defence of someone who defrauded them.Had the bank conducted even a simple, early-stage verification of Frank’s user data—such as requesting direct access to the platform’s actual customer records or running a basic audit—this entire dispute could have been avoided. Instead, delayed due diligence and overconfidence in the startup’s claims set the stage for a costly legal mess that continues years after the fraud was uncovered.JPMorgan’s frustration has grown as the legal bills have ballooned. The bank claims the expenses submitted include personal items such as cellulite butter, first-class travel upgrades, and hotel luxuries. Its lawyers argue that the billing records contain “extreme abuses,” including claims for work hours that seem physically impossible.Javice’s spokesperson denies that she personally submitted these questionable charges, stating that her legal team is responsible for all billing decisions.Even though Javice has already been convicted, she is now appealing her case, and the indemnification clause means the bank must continue paying her legal fees unless a court orders otherwise. JPMorgan is currently trying to convince a Delaware judge to halt these payments, arguing that the system is being misused.The saga has become a major lesson in the risks of fast-paced startup acquisitions. JPMorgan’s failure to properly verify Frank’s user base before buying the company has left it entangled in one of the most embarrassing and expensive due diligence failures in recent corporate history.","Charlie Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid.

Adobe to acquire Semrush for $1.9 billion in major AI-and-SEO expansion push,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/adobe-to-acquire-semrush-for-1-9-billion-in-major-ai-and-seo-expansion-push/articleshow/125445293.cms,"Adobe strengthens its AI-powered marketing ecosystem

Why Adobe wants Semrush now





Adobe has announced plans to acquire Semrush, one of the world’s leading brand visibility and SEO intelligence platforms, in an all-cash deal valued at approximately $1.9 billion. The acquisition, approved by both companies’ boards, will see Adobe pay $12 per share — a nearly 77.5% premium over Semrush’s market price prior to the announcement. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026, pending regulatory approval and Semrush shareholder consent.The acquisition marks one of Adobe’s most significant steps yet in expanding its AI-driven marketing cloud. By integrating Semrush into Adobe Experience Cloud, the company aims to merge traditional SEO, brand visibility analytics and emerging generative AI discovery — including how brands appear in large language model (LLM) outputs.Semrush’s suite of tools — spanning keyword research, site auditing, competitive analysis, content insights and brand-mention tracking across AI platforms — will enhance Adobe’s ability to offer unified customer experience orchestration across owned channels, classic search engines and AI-powered interfaces.Within Adobe’s ecosystem, Semrush’s Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO) capabilities are expected to play a major role, enabling brands to optimise visibility not only for search engines but also for AI chatbots, recommendation engines and generative systems that increasingly shape how consumers find information.The acquisition reflects a broader shift in digital marketing. As consumers rely more on AI-generated answers than traditional search, brands face a new challenge: staying visible in a world where LLMs summarise the web and filter commercial visibility. Adobe is positioning itself as the platform that helps businesses adapt to this transition.Semrush has experienced strong enterprise growth in recent years, serving major global clients such as Amazon, TikTok, and JPMorgan Chase. Its data-rich SEO and competitive intelligence tools will give Adobe deeper insight into customer journeys, search behaviour and online brand perception — insights that become even more critical as AI reshapes the marketing landscape.Once the deal closes, Adobe plans to tightly integrate Semrush’s workflows into its analytics and content optimisation products. This will give marketers a streamlined system where SEO insights, content creation, customer data and campaign performance live under one roof — all enhanced by Adobe’s expanding AI stack.","Adobe has announced plans to acquire Semrush, one of the world’s leading brand visibility and SEO intelligence platforms.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai celebrates new breakthrough in quantum algorithm; Elon Musk replies: ‘Looks like…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-celebrates-new-breakthrough-in-quantum-algorithm-elon-musk-replies-looks-like/articleshow/124754841.cms,"



What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

‘Rough news but…’: Netflix shuts down studio behind game that hit number 1 in 26 countries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/rough-news-but-netflix-shuts-down-studio-behind-game-that-hit-number-1-in-26-countries/articleshow/124805503.cms,"Netflix shift in gaming strategy







Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including Squid Game Unleased which hit #1 in 26 countries. You’ll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles – they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through. As for Bill, Scott and me – we’re going to take a little breather before tackling whatever is next. Love to hear from you if there’s anything interesting going on, workwise or otherwise.Another employee, David Luehmann, a director of game development at the studio, also posted on LinkedIn, saying, ""After 10+ great years working at Boss Fight, the last few as part of Netflix, the time has come for the studio to close down.""“I am very proud of all the people, work, and games we've released. I wish you could see what we had cooking! There are many talented people that have been impacted by this. If anyone is looking to grow, I'll have many recommendations for you!” he added.Netflix acquired Boss Fight Entertainment in 2022 as part of its effort to diversify revenue streams by building out its video game offerings, news agency Reuters reported.The studio was known for developing two games available on the platform: Netflix Stories and the highly successful Squid Game: Unleashed, which reportedly hit the number one spot in 26 countries.The streaming giant's move follows an earnings call earlier this week where Co-CEO Greg Peters specifically praised Squid Game: Unleashed as an example of the kind of narrative game the company wanted to create based on its original shows.However, the company, which named Alain Tascan as president of games last year, is implementing a new strategy that will focus on four specific categories: party, narrative, kids, and mainstream games, the report added. The studio’s closure signals a realignment of resources toward this updated focus.Despite the shutdown, Boss Fight's two games, Netflix Stories and Squid Game: Unleashed, will continue to be available on the Netflix platform.","Boss Fight Entertainment's co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week.

Easing rules for AI training







The European Commission has said that it will streamline and ease several key technology regulations, including delaying major provisions of its landmark AI Act, in a move which can be seen as a victory for tech giants like Google, Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta and OpenAI. The effort, dubbed a ‘Digital Omnibus,’ aims to cut red tape and boost Europe's competitiveness following intense criticism against the continent’s stringent regulatory landscape.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the most significant proposal involves delaying the enforcement of the strictest rules on “high risk” uses of AI from August 2026 to December 2027.The report said that this grace period offers tech companies more time to comply with regulations governing AI applications in critical areas, including biometric identification, job applications and exams, health services, law enforcement and creditworthiness assessments.“Simplification is not deregulation. Simplification means that we are taking a critical look at our regulatory landscape,” a Commission official stated, defending the decision despite concerns about weakening consumer protections.The package also proposes changes affecting core privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These amendments will allow major technology companies to potentially use Europeans’ personal data to train their AI models, a key need for companies like Google and OpenAI as they develop sophisticated generative AI systems.Furthermore, the Commission proposed simplifying the process for obtaining consent for pop-up “cookies,” addressing a frequent complaint from both users and businesses.The package covers a wide range of legislation, including the AI Act, GDPR, the e-Privacy Directive, and the Data Act. The proposals will now proceed to debate and require votes from European member countries before becoming law.","The European Commission has said that it will streamline and ease several key technology regulations, including delaying major provisions of its landmark AI Act.

Indian travelers are displaying confidence and a massive appetite for travel, with 68% relying on YouTube videos as their primary source of inspiration, according to the new Google-commissioned Kantar report, ‘Travel Rewired: Decoding The Indian Traveler. ’ The report, which surveyed consumers across Metros, Tier 1, and Tier 2 cities, found that 88% of Indians are keen to travel.According to the report, a trend shows that cost is less of a concern than maximising value and comfort. Domestically, 72% of travelers are less concerned about cost and 81% expect to splurge. This premium spending is evident in international travel, where the average expenditure is 3.2 times that of a domestic trip.The report says digital platforms are essential across the entire journey with YouTube dominating the discovery phase, with its creators highly influential and trusted by 59% of travelers during planning. Even short-form videos (Shorts) are used for inspiration by two in five travelers.When it comes to booking preference, 85% of travelers prefer to book online, with brand trust serving as the top deciding factor for choosing airlines and accommodation.Both Google Search and YouTube play critical roles during the research phase, guiding travelers on key activities (51% use Search) and accommodations (46% use Search).The study identified four distinct traveler profiles, all unified by their high reliance on digital content creators:These travelers, who pursue niche experiences like gig-tripping, show the highest use of inspiration touchpoints, with 71% citing YouTube as their top source.A high-value segment focused on luxury and convenience; 88% use YouTube for creator-led information during their meticulous, week-plus long planning phase.Predominantly younger individuals who are first-time planners or payers.

"Microsoft Ignite 2025: Microsoft 365 Copilot gets AI agents for Word, Excel and PowerPoint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ignite-2025-microsoft-365-copilot-gets-word-excel-and-powerpoint-agents/articleshow/125438656.cms,"How Microsoft designed these agents







At Microsoft Ignite 2025, Microsoft announced the introduction of dedicated Word, Excel, and PowerPoint agents within Microsoft 365 Copilot. These new agents will allow users to create documents, spreadsheets, and presentations directly in Copilot Chat. The agents use advanced reasoning models to produce structured, high-quality output for productivity tasks. This integration will allow users to start projects in Copilot Chat using natural-language prompts to generate initial drafts quickly. The agents are designed to guide the user by asking clarifying questions, helping to shape the output to match specific goals and uses, whether the task is drafting a strategic plan, analysing data, or building a presentation.Once the initial draft is ready, users can easily move into the specific apps like Word, Excel, or PowerPoint for further editing and customisation. Within these apps, Copilot will continue to assist with refining content and applying formatting.A new feature called Agent Mode will extend Copilot's capabilities within each app, enabling direct edits and changes with powerful, application-specific tools, thereby enhancing interactivity and action.Notably, Agent Mode for PowerPoint is new to the Frontier program, which adds enhanced creation and editing capabilities to presentations.Microsoft explains that its goal was to bring the idea of coding agents from software engineering into Office. The company wants Office agents to handle long, complex tasks for users and to create high-quality Word documents, Excel sheets, and PowerPoint decks.To do this, they built an “agentic harness,” a system that helps agents plan and complete tasks using AI models. These agents use the same Word, Excel, and PowerPoint skills available in Agent Mode, but now inside Copilot Chat.The agents can plan, check, and refine their work in multiple steps, which helps them produce steady and reliable results. With Microsoft’s Office architecture and enterprise systems, this becomes an essential step toward AI-supported content creation.Early testing shows that the output quality is similar to that of other agent systems, and the team expects further improvements over time.The agentic harness uses a skills-based design that lets Office agents plan and work together in a modular way. A key challenge was building a secure environment in which agents could run independently while maintaining safe access to Microsoft 365 services.The company created a protected sandbox with controlled access to resources. Complex agents remain difficult to build, so Microsoft added harness hooks and sub-agents to maintain control and reliability. Each agent runs in a locked-down container with no direct internet access, using secure APIs and a brokered WebSocket for communication.Instead of creating Office files directly, the agent first produces an intermediate format that later becomes a full Office document. This helps protect user data and ensures accuracy. Office apps generate the final files, which preserve formatting, themes, formulas, and security features such as sensitivity labels.The system also uses Work IQ to bring in approved enterprise context from Microsoft Graph, such as notes or emails, only with the user’s permissions. Files are stored safely in OneDrive, where Microsoft’s policies and protections keep them safe.The agents also use multi-step reasoning, similar to how a human consultant works. This includes planning, researching, drafting and reviewing. They run checks during the process to confirm calculations and improve drafts. This leads to more accurate and consistent results.The company even reused many elements from Office’s existing Agent Mode, helping ensure consistency and speeding up development as Office continues to evolve.Apart from this, Microsoft says that Word, Excel, and PowerPoint Agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot are only the early steps. As more organisations join the Frontier program, the company plans to add new features, improve the overall experience, and respond to user feedback.Upcoming updates may include better use of enterprise data in Excel, smoother switching between chat and the apps, and new ways to work and create together.These agents are designed to support users as they write documents, study data, or build presentations, helping them move from an idea to a final result with less effort.Microsoft says more updates are on the way as Copilot continues to grow as an AI partner in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.","Microsoft has introduced Word, Excel, and PowerPoint agents in Copilot Chat.

Cloudflare down: OpenAI, Twitter, Spotify, Canva, Claude and other big businesses that Cloudflare outage 'disrupted'

“Really proud of the DeepLearningAI team. When Cloudflare went down, our engineers used AI coding to quickly implement a clone of basic Cloudflare capabilities to run our site on. So we came back up long before even major websites!”

How the Cloudflare outage affected internet users



“Please unblock challenges.cloudflare.com to proceed,”

“A latent bug in a service underpinning our bot mitigation capability started to crash after a routine configuration change we made. That cascaded into a broad degradation of our network and other services. This was not an attack.”

A recent Cloudflare outage disrupted hundreds of websites, including major ones such as X (formerly Twitter), ChatGPT, Spotify, and more. The effects of the nearly six-hour blackout ended after the IT services company announced that the issue had been resolved and that users could access websites that rely on Cloudflare’s infrastructure. However, the US-based edtech company Coursera has claimed it was able to restore its services much earlier than major websites. The company’s co-founder, Andrew Ng, who has also served as the former head of Google Brain and Baidu AI Group, took to the social media platform X to reveal that Coursera restored its site well before the Cloudflare outage was resolved. According to Ng, the company’s engineers used AI coding to quickly deploy a clone of basic Cloudflare capabilities to run the company’s site.In his X post, Ng wrote:The Cloudflare outage made many websites difficult or impossible to use. Users reported trouble loading posts on X, opening tools like Canva, using chatbots such as ChatGPT, or accessing games like League of Legends.In many cases, users saw a message saying,which prevented them from reaching the site. This happened because Cloudflare’s security and challenge systems were not working correctly, even though the websites themselves were still running.Since Cloudflare handles content delivery and security for many internet services, problems on its network can affect a large number of websites at once. This outage caused several unrelated sites to go down simultaneously.Explaining the reason behind the outage, Cloudflare CTO Dane Knecht wrote on X:Cloudflare provides DNS, CDN, and DDoS protection for several websites; which is why the outage triggered a chain of issues.
