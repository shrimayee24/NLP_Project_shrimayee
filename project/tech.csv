Brittany Mahomes chooses Travis Kelce over Patrick Mahomes in Chiefs night out

Brittany Mahomes enjoyed a concert night out with Travis Kelce and friends, while her husband Patrick Mahomes and Kelce's partner Taylor Swift were not present in all shared photos. This outing showcased the strong comradery among the Chiefs' extended circle beyond football.Although the Kansas City Chiefs push through their preseason minicamp, key players like quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce are in rigorous coaching. Yet, even amidst the work, these professional athletes found a moment to step away and enjoy a concert on a recent Thursday evening.Brittany Mahomes, Patrick's wife, offered a glimpse into their off-field life through her Instagram. She initially shared a video capturing a sweet, relaxed moment with her husband. However, what truly caught the attention was a picture featuring Brittany surrounded by friends, with Travis Kelce among them. Noticeably absent from this particular photo were Patrick Mahomes and Kelce's acclaimed partner, Taylor Swift.This casual gathering came to existence shortly after Kelce and Swift's high-profile appearance at the Stanley Cup Final, making Swift's absence from this concert all the more remarkable to fans.Brittany, embracing the chance for a different kind of social engagement, seemed to appreciate the time spent with Kelce and their mutual friends. It appeared to be a favourable time for them to relax, far from the usual pressures of their football and ‘parenting duties. ’As for Patrick and Brittany, family remains a central pillar, especially with ‘three young children at home.’ They handle the complexities of the demanding NFL schedule alongside their significant ‘parenting’ responsibilities. Still, they understand the value of withdrawing personal time to refresh and reconnect.Their night out discreetly highlights the close-knit bonds that extend beyond the football field within the Chiefs organization. These relationships, embracing teammates and their families, form a quiet but vital component of the team's culture as they aim for ""another championship run.""Travis Kelce, in particular, maintains a consistent presence within the Mahomes family circle, underscoring the depth of their friendship. While Taylor Swift's absence was noted by fans, this specific evening truly underscored the deep “camaraderie that exists within the Chiefs circle,” demonstrating how these connections reach ""beyond the field and into everyday life.""Also Read: While Taylor Swift is away, Travis Kelce and Brittany Mahomes share unexpected off-duty bonding moment Moments like these, whether celebrating victories, offering support during stringent seasons, or simply enjoying ""time at a concert,"" serve to emphasize the powerful relationships flourishing within the Chiefs' inner network.","Brittany Mahomes enjoyed a concert night out with Travis Kelce and friends, while her husband Patrick Mahomes and Kelce's partner Taylor Swift were not present.

As temperatures rise across the UAE, so do frustrations on the streets, not from the heat, but from the unrelenting noise and reckless driving now plaguing many residential neighbourhoods. Families from Sharjah to Fujairah are voicing deep concern over the disruptive behaviour of young motorists, whose cars often roar through quiet streets late into the night, shattering peace and disturbing daily life.This summer, UAE police forces are taking a zero-tolerance approach.With schools closed and summer break in full swing, many residents report that what should be a time of rest has turned into a season of disturbance. Late-night car honking, blaring music systems, and illegally modified exhausts have become unwelcome markers of the season, especially in suburban communities.“These actions are keeping children awake at night, disturbing patients and the elderly, and making daily life stressful,” one family toldEven fellow motorists aren’t spared. The roads themselves have become battlegrounds of aggressive noise, where sudden honks and pounding basslines from car stereos have sparked rising tension among drivers.In response to mounting complaints, law enforcement agencies across the Emirates have intensified patrols and enforcement campaigns, particularly in residential and sensitive zones near schools, hospitals, and family neighbourhoods.“Sharjah Police are stepping up patrols in residential areas, and we won’t tolerate behaviour that disrupts public peace,”In Ajman, similar efforts are underway.“These practices are disrespectful and dangerous,”Fujairah Police echoed these concerns, noting that the most common complaints they’ve received involve excessive horn use, screeching tyres, and illegal vehicle alterations.“This kind of behaviour is not only uncivilised but also paints a negative picture of our society,”The UAE’s Federal Traffic Law leaves little room for leniency when it comes to noise and illegal modifications:If a vehicle has been illegally modified without prior approval, it may be impounded, with a Dh10,000 fee required for release. If the owner fails to pay the fine within three months, the vehicle is put up for auction.The message from authorities is unmistakable: non-compliance is costly, and tolerance is wearing thin.Though the law is not new, enforcement is ramping up. Official statistics from the Ministry of Interior show a steady rise in noise-related offences last year alone:Those numbers are expected to rise further this summer as police increase their presence on the streets and residents remain on high alert.Across all emirates, authorities are urging young drivers, the demographic most often linked to these violations, to show respect for community life and understand that driving is a shared responsibility, not a personal performance.“We are asking motorists to be mindful of their surroundings, especially near schools, hospitals, and homes, and to avoid aggressive honking or blasting music,”The current crackdown is not simply about punishment. It’s about protecting the public’s right to peace and safety, particularly for children, the elderly, and patients who suffer most from such disruptions.","Drivers using loud horns or modified exhausts near homes, schools, or hospitals can face fines of up to Dh10,000 and vehicle impoundment. Families from Sharjah to Fujairah are voicing deep concern over the disruptive behaviour of young motorists. “These actions are keeping children awake at night, disturbing patients and the elderly, and making daily life stressful,” one family told.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121994014,imgsize-91366,width-400,resizemode-4/121994014.jpg"
How a fraudster in Dubai used ‘magic ink’ to to pull off a fake bank loan scam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/how-a-fraudster-in-dubai-used-magic-ink-to-to-pull-off-a-fake-bank-loan-scam/articleshow/121972897.cms,"He used disappearing ‘magic ink’ to change cheque details after victims signed them/ Image: Dubai police

Fake Account Opening Charges:



The fraudster would first convince victims to sign documents related to supposed ""account opening fees."" These documents were presented as formalities necessary for securing the bank loan. Victims would pay upfront sums, believing these were standard banking procedures.



Cheque Forgery Using Magic Ink:



In the second stage, the scammer requested cheques from victims. He would fill out key cheque details, such as the payee name and amount, using 'magic ink', a special ink that disappears after a short time. Meanwhile, the victims would sign the cheques using a regular pen, unaware of the disappearing ink. Once the cheque details vanished, the fraudster would rewrite the cheques, inserting his own name and altering the amount. Armed with knowledge of the victims’ bank balances, he manipulated the cheques for maximum financial gain.







Do not deal with unofficial intermediaries claiming they can secure bank loans or services in exchange for money.





Always verify the identity of financial representatives by checking their official company-issued IDs.





Use your own pen when signing any financial documents, especially cheques.





Contact the bank directly if there's any doubt about a representative's authenticity.













Dubai Police have apprehended an Asian man who orchestrated a sophisticated scam involving the use of 'magic ink' to create fake bank documents and con victims under the guise of facilitating bank loans. According to an official statement by Dubai Police, the man posed as a legitimate banking professional and used fraudulent identification, including fake business cards and a fabricated job ID, to deceive individuals in need of financial services.Victims were led to believe that the fraudster had the ability to secure bank loans on their behalf. In return, they were asked to pay fees and provide signed documents. The scam came to light after multiple complaints were filed by victims, prompting an investigation by the Fraud Prevention Center, a specialized division within Dubai Police.Police detailed that the conman employed two distinct yet interconnected tactics to exploit his victims:In their official advisory, Dubai Police urged the public to remain alert and cautious when engaging with anyone offering banking or financial services outside official channels.They emphasized several important safety measures:Dubai Police reiterated that these precautions are vital in preventing such scams and protecting personal finances from exploitation.Authorities encouraged community members to promptly report any suspicious activity or cybercrime through the Dubai Police smart app or the eCrime platform. These tools are designed to enable quick and efficient responses to financial fraud, phishing, and other tech-enabled crimes.Dubai Police concluded by reaffirming their “unwavering commitment to pursuing individuals who threaten community safety or attempt to take money from others unlawfully.”",Dubai Police apprehended an Asian man who orchestrated a sophisticated scam.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct.

After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Read: Amazon CEO's full address to employees

Today, in virtually every corner of the company, we're using Generative AI to make customers lives better and easier. What started as deep conviction that every customer experience would be reinvented using AI, and that altogether new experiences we've only dreamed of would become possible, is rapidly becoming reality. Technologies like Generative AI are rare; they come about once-in-a-lifetime, and completely change what's possible for customers and businesses. So, we are investing quite expansively, and, the progress we are making is evident.

You can see it in what we're rolling out in Alexa+, our next generation

Alexa

personal assistant that's meaningfully smarter, more capable, and is the first personal assistant that can take significant actions for customers on top of providing intelligent answers to virtually any question.

You can see it with our AI shopping assistant that's being used by tens of millions of customers around the world to discover new products and make more informed purchase decisions.

You can see it in an increasing array of shopping features like ""Lens"" (very cool to be able to take a picture of an item and have it pull up the shopping result), ""Buy for Me"" (where I can ask our shopping agent to buy an item on another merchant's website for me), or Recommended Size (where we can predict the right size for you based on prior purchases and how different apparel brands run fit-wise relative to each other).

You can see it in how we're helping our independent sellers more easily create new product detail pages or get advice on how to be even more effective as a seller in our marketplace. Nearly half a million selling partners are using these services, and the listings they're creating are measurably better.

You can see it in Advertising where we've built a suite of AI tools that make it easier for brands to plan, onboard, create and optimize campaigns. In Q1 alone, over 50K advertisers used these capabilities.

And, you can see it in what we're delivering in AWS for builders, whether it's custom silicon (Trainium2) to provide better price-performance on model-training and inference, services that make it much easier to build Foundation Models (SageMaker), or leverage leading frontier models and do GenAI inference at scale (Bedrock), our own frontier model (Nova) to give customers leading intelligence at lower latency and cost, or services to make it much easier for developers to write code (Q and QCLI).

We're also using Generative AI broadly across our internal operations. In our fulfillment network, we're using AI to improve inventory placement, demand forecasting, and the efficiency of our robots—all of which have improved cost to serve and delivery speed. We've rebuilt our Customer Service Chatbot with GenAI, providing an even better experience than we'd had before. And, we're assembling more intelligent and compelling product detail pages from leveraging GenAI.

I could go on, but you get the idea.

While we've made a lot of progress, we're still at the relative beginning. There are a few reasons we believe this and want to go even faster.

First, we have strong conviction that AI agents will change how we all work and live. Think of agents as software systems that use AI to perform tasks on behalf of users or other systems. Agents let you tell them what you want (often in natural language), and do things like scour the web (and various data sources) and summarize results, engage in deep research, write code, find anomalies, highlight interesting insights, translate language and code into other variants, and automate a lot of tasks that consume our time. There will be billions of these agents, across every company and in every imaginable field. There will also be agents that routinely do things for you outside of work, from shopping to travel to daily chores and tasks. Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they're coming, and coming fast.

Second, and what makes this agentic future so compelling for Amazon, is that these agents are going to change the scope and speed at which we can innovate for customers. Agents will allow us to start almost everything from a more advanced starting point. We'll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones. Agents will be teammates that we can call on at various stages of our work, and that will get wiser and more helpful with more experience. If we build and leverage the right agents, it's going to rapidly accelerate our ability to make customers lives easier and better every day, and it's going to make our jobs even more exciting and fun than they are today.

And third, we're going to keep pushing to operate like the world's largest start-up-- customer-obsessed, inventive, fast-moving, lean, scrappy, and full of missionaries trying to build something better for customers and a business that outlasts us all. You will continue to see steam and I take actions to help us move faster, have more ownership, and invent more easily. AI will be a substantial catalyst here.

Today, we have over 1,000 Generative AI services and applications in progress or built, but at our scale, that's a small fraction of what we will ultimately build. We're going to lean in further in the coming months. We're going to make it much easier to build agents, and then build (or partner) on several new agents across all of our business units and G&A areas.

As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It's hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.

As we go through this transformation together, be curious about AI, educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your team's brainstorms to figure out how to invent for our customers more quickly and expansively, and how to get more done with scrappier teams. When I first started at Amazon in 1997 as an Assistant Product Manager, I worked on leaner teams that got a lot done quickly and where I could have substantial impact. We didn't have tools resembling anything like Generative AI, but we had broad remits, high ambition, and saw the opportunity to improve (and invent) so many customer experiences. Fast forward 28 years and the most transformative technology since the Internet is here. Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company.

There's so much more to come with Generative AI. I'm energized by our progress, excited about our plans ahead, and looking forward to partnering with you all as we change what's possible for our customers, partners, and how we work.

GitHub CEO to software engineers: ‘Key for winning’ AI coding tools is in ….,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/github-ceo-to-software-developers-key-for-winning-ai-coding-tools-is-in-/articleshow/121991206.cms,"Thomas Dohmke, CEO of GitHub

Startups can't rely on ""vibe coding"" alone

GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke says the ""key for winning"" with AI coding tools is maintaining the ability to quickly modify AI-generated code manually, rather than relying entirely on automated agents. Speaking on ""The MAD Podcast with Matt Turck,"" Dohmke emphasized that developers need flexibility to seamlessly transition between AI assistance and hands-on coding.The CEO outlined an ideal workflow where AI agents can write code and submit pull requests, but developers retain the ability to make rapid changes using their existing programming skills . This approach prevents the productivity trap of spending minutes describing simple changes in natural language when the same task could be completed in seconds through direct coding.""The worst alternative is trying to figure out how to provide feedback or prompt to describe in natural language what I already know how to do in programming language,"" Thomas Dohmke explained. Such scenarios could transform three-second tasks into three-minute ordeals, ultimately reducing rather than enhancing productivity.Thomas Dohmke also addressed the trending "" vibe coding "" phenomenon, a term coined by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy to describe heavy reliance on AI for code generation. During a recent Q&A at Station F in Paris, the GitHub CEO cautioned that startups cannot scale on vibe coding alone.Non-technical founders will struggle to build sustainable companies without skilled developers, he argued, noting they ""can't build a complex system to justify the next round."" The key is enabling developers to choose the best approach for each situation, whether that's leveraging AI agents for maximum ROI or handling tasks directly themselves.","GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke says developers need flexibility to seamlessly transition between AI assistance and hands-on coding.
