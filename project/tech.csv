UAE national day 2025: Cultural significance, inclusivity, and economic impact





Key cultural and social themes of this year’s celebrations include:

Unity and national pride among Emirati citizens.

Inclusion and participation of the UAE’s large expatriate community, invited to take part in public festivities.

A continued emphasis on modernity integrated with tradition, evident in the use of drone shows and digital storytelling alongside heritage performances.





The United Arab Emirates is preparing for an especially elaborate celebration of its 54th National Day, observed annually on December 2. Authorities have officially declared December 2 and 3 (Tuesday and Wednesday) as public holidays, with strong speculation that December 1 (Monday) may also be granted as a holiday—potentially creating a four- or even five-day weekend. As the country marks more than half a century of union, preparations are underway for one of the largest Eid Al Etihad commemorations to date, blending deep-rooted cultural traditions with high-tech spectacles across the seven emirates.The UAE Cabinet has confirmed December 2 and 3, 2025 as official public holidays in honour of Eid Al Etihad, or Festival of the Union, commemorating the founding of the nation on December 2, 1971. With these days falling on a Tuesday and Wednesday, the inclusion of Monday, December 1, as a holiday could extend the break to four days, or possibly five depending on the weekend alignment.This potential long weekend is expected to benefit both social and economic activities. Residents and families will have more time to travel within the country, participate in public festivities, or take advantage of the extended holiday period for leisure or short-term vacations.Authorities have not yet confirmed the status of December 1, but based on prior years and UAE holiday policies, there is growing anticipation that an official announcement will follow soon.The UAE’s 54th National Day celebrations are set to feature a series of expansive and coordinated events across all emirates, with major public and private venues playing host to cultural, entertainment, and community-focused programs.These innovations highlight the UAE’s unique fusion of cultural heritage and modern innovation.Public transportation services across major cities are expected to extend operational hours, while law enforcement and municipal bodies are preparing traffic and safety protocols to manage the anticipated increase in footfall at celebration venues.At the centre of the celebrations will be a grand official ceremony on Tuesday, December 2, to be attended by the UAE’s leadership. While the venue for the main event has not yet been revealed, organisers have confirmed it will be a site of deep cultural and national relevance.In 2024, the ceremony was held at Jebel Hafeet in Al Ain, where the nation’s heritage and vision for the future were presented through immersive storytelling and performances. A similarly meaningful location is expected to be selected for the 2025 event, and details are expected to be made public in the coming weeks.Preparations officially began on Union Pledge Day, marking the symbolic start of a nationwide effort to build an inclusive, celebratory experience that reflects the UAE’s values of unity and diversity.The 54th National Day serves as a reminder of the UAE’s evolution from its unification in 1971 into a global centre for innovation, commerce, and cross-cultural engagement. Eid Al Etihad is not only a time of celebration but also of reflection—honouring the nation’s history while highlighting its ambitions for the future.Organisers have also released behind-the-scenes footage from the 2024 ceremony, showcasing the depth of planning and artistic execution that goes into these annual events. The footage aims to build excitement and demonstrate the UAE’s commitment to making National Day a culturally resonant and visually compelling occasion.On the economic front, long public holidays like these are known to boost local tourism and retail sectors, with increased activity in hotels, restaurants, and shopping destinations. Travel agencies typically report a spike in bookings, as residents look to make the most of the extended break for domestic or short international getaways. This year’s celebrations are also expected to set new records in tourism and retail spending, reflecting the growing impact of National Day on the UAE’s economy.","The United Arab Emirates is preparing for an especially elaborate celebration of its 54th National Day, observed annually on December 2.

Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is preparing to introduce its latest wearable technology at the annual Connect event, which is widely seen as a showcase for its augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions, innovation roadmap, and future consumer experiences. This new product represents the company’s first consumer-ready smart glasses with an integrated digital display, signaling a significant step in Meta’s long-term strategy to bring advanced AI into everyday life and enhance human-computer interaction.The glasses, expected to retail at around $800, will carry the internal code name “Hypernova” and are likely to launch under the brand name “Celeste.” While the glasses’ display is relatively small, it is designed to handle basic digital interactions such as notifications, alerts, messages, and reminders, offering users a glimpse into the potential of AR without being fully immersive.Meta is positioning this launch not just as a gadget, but as a foundational element in its broader vision of wearable technology that interacts seamlessly with AI, potentially transforming the way people access information, collaborate remotely, and connect with the digital world.Over the past several years, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has committed enormous resources—more than $60 billion since 2020—into Meta’s augmented reality and AI divisions.The company envisions smart glasses as a key interface for what is sometimes referred to as “superintelligence,” a theoretical AI that surpasses human capabilities across nearly every cognitive domain.Meta already offers two existing lines of smart glasses in partnership with Ray-Ban and Oakley, which include AI-driven features like cameras, hands-free controls, and livestreaming capabilities to Meta’s social platforms. These products have achieved moderate consumer success, selling around two million units since 2023, making Meta one of the few tech giants to gain traction in the smart glasses market—a market where competitors like Google have struggled.The new Celeste glasses, however, are distinct from these earlier offerings. They represent a step toward more advanced AR capabilities, though they remain less sophisticated than the “Orion” prototype showcased last year, which was presented by Zuckerberg as a “time machine to the future.” Orion, slated for launch in 2027, is expected to be far more technologically advanced and consumer-ready for immersive AR experiences.Celeste will feature a small, integrated display in the right lens, offering essential functions such as notifications and alerts. Analysts have suggested that this modest approach allows Meta to introduce AR to the consumer market gradually, focusing on usability and developer engagement rather than attempting a full-fledged, high-cost immersive device right away.In addition to the glasses, Meta is expected to introduce a new wristband accessory that will allow users to control the device with hand gestures. This accessory enhances interactivity, letting users navigate the glasses without needing to touch them physically, and represents a step toward hands-free, seamless integration of AR into daily life.The company may also incorporate branding collaborations, with rumors suggesting that the Italian fashion house Prada could provide design input. Prada’s signature thick frames and arms could help house the necessary components for the display, battery, and sensors while giving the glasses a premium aesthetic.One of the primary concerns for Celeste is its price. As reported by Reuters, at approximately $800, the glasses are substantially more expensive than Meta’s existing Ray-Ban and Oakley lines, which start at $299 and $399, respectively. Analysts warn that this pricing could limit adoption to tech enthusiasts and early adopters, rather than appealing to a broad consumer base.Jitesh Ubrani, research manager at IDC, pointed out that the device is likely to be somewhat bulky and less consumer-friendly, predicting that sales might reach only a few hundred thousand units initially. Nevertheless, he emphasized that the launch could play a strategic role in attracting developers to create apps for the platform, paving the way for more advanced, mass-market AR devices in the future.Meta’s innovation drive has not been without controversy. The company has faced scrutiny over its handling of child safety on its social media and virtual reality platforms. Whistleblowers have claimed that internal policies previously allowed AI chatbots to engage children in inappropriate conversations, and researchers were allegedly discouraged from investigating potential harms related to VR experiences. Meta has since revised these policies to prohibit such interactions and improve child protection measures.The timing of the Celeste launch highlights the tension Meta faces: the company is racing to maintain relevance in the AI and AR sectors while simultaneously responding to ongoing ethical and regulatory concerns. How it manages these risks will influence consumer trust and adoption of its new wearable products.A key component of the Celeste launch is Meta’s emphasis on developer engagement. The company plans to open the device to third-party developers through a new software kit, enabling external creators to build AR applications and utilities for the glasses.This approach reflects a long-term strategy: while initial sales might be modest, building a robust developer ecosystem is essential for creating a sustainable market for AR devices. By fostering innovation in apps and experiences, Meta hopes to expand the appeal of smart glasses and gradually transition toward more advanced, mainstream products like the Orion headset.","Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms, is preparing to introduce its latest wearable technology at the annual Connect event.

Why Patch 11.06 is a milestone for Valorant







Riot Games has rolled out Valorant Patch 11.06, introducing the long-awaited Replay System for Competitive, Unrated, Swiftplay, and Premier matches. This feature allows players across all platforms—PC and consoles—to review gameplay, analyze strategies, and revisit key moments, providing a powerful tool for both casual gamers and esports professionals.The update also targets disruptive bot activity, with around 40,000 bot accounts banned over the past six months in a sustained and ongoing ban wave, improving matchmaking fairness. Agent-specific bugs, including rare issues affecting Yoru and Reyna, have been resolved, while PC performance has been enhanced with permanently enabled input settings, streamlining gameplay responsiveness.Console players receive fixes for New Player Tips, improving guidance for newcomers, although a known issue remains where dropped weapons and the Spike incorrectly highlight when players are merely nearby rather than directly looking at them. Riot has confirmed this will be fixed in Patch 11.07. Overall, Patch 11.06 strengthens Valorant’s competitive and casual gameplay across all platforms.One of the most exciting features in Patch 11.06 is the Replay System, now available for Competitive, Unrated, Swiftplay, and Premier matches on all platforms, including consoles and mobile devices. This system allows players to review past games, analyze key moments, evaluate strategies, track performance trends, and share highlights with teammates or friends with precise control over replay playback.The feature is designed to be versatile: casual players can revisit clutch plays, important mistakes, or learning opportunities to improve personal gameplay, while professional esports teams can use the tool to refine team strategies, study opponents’ tactics, and optimize coordinated team performance across competitive tournaments.A major concern for Valorant players has been bot activity, particularly in lower ranks where artificial accounts can disrupt fair matchmaking. In Patch 11.06, Riot has taken significant action by banning approximately 40,000 bot accounts over the last six months, reflecting a continued and sustained crackdown on bots.This crackdown is expected to improve the quality and fairness of matches, particularly for new and casual players who are most affected by bot interference.Patch 11.06 also addresses agent-related bugs that could impact gameplay. Notably, a rare bug affecting Yoru and Reyna has been fixed. Previously, under very specific conditions, these agents would return to their original location after their invisibility ended, creating unintended advantages or confusing gameplay scenarios.On the technical side, Riot Games has optimized the PC version of Valorant by removing the RawInputBuffer setting as a configurable option and keeping it permanently enabled. Developers found that this change provides better input performance, making gameplay smoother and more responsive for all PC players.Patch 11.06 also brings changes for console users. Riot fixed issues with New Player Tips, ensuring they display correctly to help guide newcomers.However, a known issue remains where dropped weapons and the Spike highlight incorrectly, triggering when players are merely nearby rather than directly looking at these objects. Riot has confirmed this will be addressed in Patch 11.07, showing ongoing attention to console-specific gameplay refinements.Launch the Riot Games client on your PC.

Athletes get their own Oakley AI Glasses with Garmin and Strava integration





Meta unveiled its most advanced smart glasses yet at its Connect conference, introducing the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display with a built-in screen and gesture controls, alongside updated versions of its popular Ray-Ban collaboration and new sports-focused Oakley frames.As the name implies, the Meta Ray-Ban Display features a full-colour, high-resolution display built into the right lens that activates only when needed, remaining invisible during regular use to avoid obstruction. Each pair includes the Meta Neural Band, an EMG wristband that reads muscle signals from subtle finger movements and converts them into commands for controlling the glasses.CEO Mark Zuckerberg demonstrated the glasses live on stage, showing how users can check messages, preview photos, see translations, get help from Meta AI, and navigate through content using simple hand gestures detected by the wristband. The Neural Band allows users to scroll by sliding their thumb across their gripped hand, select items by pinching thumb and index finger together, and adjust volume by rotating their wrist.The display glasses offer six hours of mixed-use battery life, with the charging case providing an additional 30 hours. The wristband itself delivers 18 hours of battery life and features an IPX7 water rating. Meta built the band with Vectran, the same material used on Mars Rover crash pads, making it strong as steel when pulled yet soft enough to bend comfortably.Meta’s Ray-Ban Display can do visual responses with Meta AI, messaging and video calling through WhatsApp and Messenger, real-time camera viewfinder with zoom, pedestrian navigation with turn-by-turn directions, live captions and translation, and music playback controls.Despite some technical hiccups during the live demonstration—including failed attempts at recipe requests and video calls—Zuckerberg emphasized that these are production-ready devices, not prototypes. ""This isn't a prototype. This is here, it's ready to go and you're going to be able to buy it in a couple of weeks,"" he stated.The glasses will be available September 30th at select retailers including Best Buy, LensCrafters, and Ray-Ban stores, with expansion to Canada, France, Italy, and the UK planned for early 2026.Meta also announced the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, an improved version of its bestselling AI glasses that have sold millions of units worldwide. The updated glasses nearly double the battery life of the original model, offering up to eight hours of use compared to the previous four-hour capacity.The Gen 2 model features significant camera improvements, including 3K Ultra HD video capture with ultrawide HDR and the ability to record at up to 60 frames per second. The charging case now provides 48 hours of additional power, up from 36 hours in the original version. New software features include ""conversation focus,"" which amplifies the voice of the person you're speaking with while filtering out background noise, and expanded live translation supporting German and Portuguese alongside existing languages. The Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 starts at $379 and is available immediately in Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner styles.The Oakley Meta Vanguard targets high-intensity sports enthusiasts with specialised features for athletic performance. These $499 glasses integrate directly with Garmin devices and Strava, allowing users to ask Meta AI about heart rate, pace, and other fitness metrics in real-time without looking at their wrist or phone.The Vanguard features a wraparound design optimised for cycling helmets and hats, with IP67 dust and water resistance rating. The glasses include Meta's most powerful speakers yet—six decibels louder than previous Oakley models—and a five-microphone array designed to reduce wind noise. An autocapture feature works with Garmin to automatically record video clips when hitting distance milestones or ramping up heart rate and speed. The glasses offer nine hours of battery life and will be available October 21st, with pre-orders starting now.","Meta unveils $799 Ray-Ban Display with built-in screen and gesture controls.

China’s massive military parade on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of its victory against Japan in WWII showcased cutting-edge military hardware that has got global defence experts talking. Here’s a look at the platforms that highlight China’s rapid military modernisation and present a clear challenge to US military superpower status.China has clearly learned from the Russia-Ukraine war and is going full throttle with AI drones that can not only wear down the enemy but also assist its own forces in real time according to battlefield conditions. Two platforms stood out: AJX002 giant submarine drone and GJ-11. The former is an extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle that can carry out reconnaissance missions, while the latter is a stealth attack drone that can fly alongside conventional fighter jets and aid them in their missions.Displayed publicly for the first time, the LY-1 is an armoured truck mounted laser weapon that can supposedly burn or disable the electronics of enemy aircraft, drones and other vehicles.A sea version of the platform was on display too. The system is ideal to tackle drone swarms and far more economical than kinetic projectile systems.The impressive array of missiles on display during the parade included a new version of Dongfeng-5 nuclear capable ICBM that can carry up to 12 warheads, can be launched from second-strike underground facilities, and has a range of 12,400 miles, bringing all of continental US within its strike reach. On the other hand, DF-61 ICBM can be fired from mobile launchers, while Dongfeng 26-D intermediate range missile has been dubbed as ‘Guam Killer’ referencing its ability to potentially target US military bases on the Pacific island territory.The quadruped robots can walk alongside soldiers or undertake missions on their own such as clearing mines, reconnaissance or hunting enemy troops. The platform is part of China’s plans to build a futuristic army, and could perhaps eventually evolve to humanoid robotic soldiers.PLA also displayed all types of its fifth-generation fighter aircraft on active duty for the first time. These included the J-20, J-20A, J-20S, J-35A, and J-35. J-20S is the world’s first twin-seat stealth jet, while J-35 is the first radar-dodging combat plane in Chinese navy. All of these are intended to show China’s growing air power capabilities.",China showcased cutting-edge military hardware that has got global defence experts talking.

Google Pay in Saudi Arabia





What Google Pay offers: Core features

Card Support Across Networks: Users can add and manage Mada debit cards as well as digital credit and prepaid cards from Visa and Mastercard.



Contactless Payments (Tap to Pay): Payments can be made via NFC (Near Field Communication) by tapping a phone or smartwatch at supported point-of-sale terminals.



(Tap to Pay): Payments can be made via NFC (Near Field Communication) by tapping a phone or smartwatch at supported point-of-sale terminals. In-App and Online Transactions: Soon, the service will also enable purchases within apps and on websites.



Google Wallet Integration: The Google Wallet app, which powers the Google Pay experience, also allows users to store loyalty cards, event tickets, boarding passes, and other digital items in one centralized location for easy access.



Security Architecture: A key strength of the platform is its multi-layered security. Instead of transmitting real card data during transactions, it uses tokenization, creating a device-specific virtual card number with a dynamic security code that refreshes with every payment. This ensures that actual card details remain protected throughout the transaction process.



Ease of Use: Activation is streamlined. Users only need to download the Google Wallet or Google Pay app, sign in with their Google account, add a bank card, and complete a quick security verification. Once set up, the phone is ready for tap-to-pay functionality.





Limitations and drawbacks: What users should consider

Restricted Bank Support at Launch: Only Riyad Bank and Al Rajhi Bank cards are supported at present. Cards issued by other banks may not yet be functional with Google Pay, though wider support is planned in upcoming phases.



Android-Only Compatibility: The service is not available to iPhone users, which confines access to users of Android smartphones or Wear OS smartwatches.



Point-of-Sale Gaps: While major retailers and e-commerce platforms already accept Google Pay, some smaller vendors may lack the necessary infrastructure or awareness to support it. This is expected to improve over time but may be an obstacle during the early adoption phase.



Dependence on Internet Connectivity: A stable internet connection is essential for initiating and verifying some transactions, especially during card addition or initial setups. In areas with poor network access, users may face interruptions or failed transactions.

How to get started: Step-by-step activation

Download the Google Wallet (or Google Pay) app from the Google Play Store.

Sign in using the Google account associated with the device.

Tap “Add Card” in the app interface.

Scan or manually enter your card details.

Complete the security verification process via your bank’s authentication method.

Once verified, your device is ready for contactless transactions.

Market impact: Google Pay enters a crowded field





Google Pay is now officially available to Android users in Saudi Arabia, marking a significant step in the Kingdom’s digital transformation efforts. Launched on September 15, 2025, in collaboration with the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA), the service brings contactless, secure payments through Android devices, with full integration into the national payment infrastructure, Mada. Here’s a detailed look at how it works, who can use it, what it offers, and what it doesn’t.The formal rollout of Google Pay in Saudi Arabia was announced during the Money20/20 Middle East event, held at the Riyadh International Convention and Exhibition Center in Mulham. This initiative, developed jointly by Google and SAMA, represents a major addition to the local digital payments ecosystem.The service operates through Mada, the national payment network, and is part of the broader push under Vision 2030 to reduce reliance on cash and enhance the Kingdom’s financial infrastructure. It also aligns with the Financial Sector Development Program, which encourages adoption of modern financial technologies and a shift toward a cashless society.Currently, Al Rajhi Bank and Riyad Bank support the service, with additional banks set to join in phases.

UPI's global expansion strategy: A vision for the future









The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has rapidly gained global attention for revolutionizing digital payments in India, and its expansion is now making waves in the Middle East, especially across the GCC nations. UPI, which allows for instant and secure transactions across multiple bank accounts, has been rolled out in countries like the UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Oman, providing both Indian nationals and tourists with a seamless payment experience.UPI, a system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), has become one of the most successful fintech innovations, boasting over ₹20 trillion in transactions by September 2024. Initially launched in India in 2016, UPI has enabled users to send and receive money in real time without sharing sensitive bank account details. As part of its ambitious internationalization strategy, NPCI’s international arm, NPCI International Payments Ltd (NIPL) has been driving UPI's expansion globally, with the goal of making the payment system available in 20 countries by FY29.So far, UPI has been rolled out in 12 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong, France, and others.In the GCC, UPI is currently available in four countries: the UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Oman. As more banks provide support, additional countries are expected to join the UPI network soon.Since 2022, UPI has expanded beyond India, initially reaching select Middle Eastern countries. With recent launches in Qatar and Oman, the GCC region is now a key player in UPI’s international growth, offering significant benefits to millions of Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) and Indian tourists.The UAE became the first country in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to roll out UPI payments. In 2022, UPI became available via the NeoPay app, enabling Indian expats to link their international mobile numbers and perform transactions without the need for an Indian SIM card. Recently, in 2025, an important update was made, allowing Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) in the UAE to access UPI without the necessity of having an Indian mobile number. This milestone significantly improved the digital payment experience for the Indian diaspora and tourists in the UAE, offering familiar and convenient payment methods.Notably, UPI payments are accepted across retail outlets, supermarkets, transportation services, and tourist spots like Dubai Mall and Mall of the Emirates. Indian tourists—who make up a significant portion of the UAE's visitors—are expected to reach 5.29 million in 2024 alone. For them, UPI brings an instant and secure payment solution without the need for cash or international cards, streamlining cross-border transactions.In 2023, Oman became the seventh country to embrace UPI and RuPay, following Singapore, Nepal, the UAE, Bhutan, Malaysia, and France. The launch in Oman was marked by a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between NPCI, NIPL, and the Central Bank of Oman (CBO) on October 4, 2022. This collaboration allows for real-time cross-border payments and the use of RuPay cards across Oman's ATM networks, POS terminals, and e-commerce platforms.With a significant number of Indian nationals living and working in Oman, UPI's introduction offers an efficient, cost-effective way for remittances to flow between India and Oman, a crucial feature for Indian expatriates.Qatar started integrating UPI payments in 2023, making it easier for Indian tourists and residents to pay at retail outlets, tourist spots, and other businesses using popular UPI apps like Google Pay, PhonePe, and Paytm . Then, in July 2024, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) teamed up with Qatar National Bank (QNB), a major milestone in expanding UPI acceptance across QNB’s merchant network. This partnership ensures that Indian visitors to Qatar now have a seamless and familiar payment experience.Qatar’s tourism industry, which sees a lot of Indian visitors, is about to get even more convenient with UPI payments. On September 16, 2025, Commercial Bank of Qatar teamed up with NPCI International Payments Limited (NIPL) to bring UPI QR code payments to its merchants. This makes paying easier for Indian tourists and strengthens Qatar’s push for a cashless economy.Saudi Arabia has been another important addition to the UPI network, with NRIs in the kingdom already able to link Saudi (+966) mobile numbers to their Indian bank accounts. This system facilitates cross-border remittances and everyday transactions through the UPI platform. Additionally, Indian expats living in Saudi Arabia can link their international mobile numbers to their NRE/NRO accounts, making it easier for them to use UPI apps such as PhonePe and Google Pay.One of the most appealing aspects of UPI for NRIs in the GCC is that it enables them to make transactions without needing an Indian mobile number. By linking an international mobile number to their NRE or NRO account, users can transfer funds to and from their Indian bank accounts through a variety of UPI-enabled apps, including PhonePe, Google Pay, Paytm, and BHIM.Here’s how you can set up UPI with an international mobile number:AU Small Finance Bank, Axis Bank, Canara Bank, City Union Bank, DBS Bank Ltd, Equitas Small Finance Bank, Federal Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IDFC First Bank, IndusInd Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Punjab National Bank, South Indian Bank, State Bank of India, Yes Bank.NPCI’s international arm, NPCI International Payments Ltd (NIPL), is driving the global expansion of UPI and RuPay. As of September 2025, UPI is live in 12 countries, including major trading partners like Singapore, Australia, the USA, and the UK. NIPL’s partnerships with institutions like QNB and Network International in the Middle East are pushing UPI deeper into global payment systems.With a focus on cross-border remittances and smoother experiences for international travelers, UPI is quickly becoming a key player in global fintech. These collaborations are helping promote India’s digital payments while supporting the growth of real-time payment systems worldwide.","Since 2022, UPI has expanded beyond India, initially reaching select Middle Eastern countries.

Bridges are more than just pathways; they are feats of engineering that connect places once divided by rivers, valleys, or mountains. For thousands of years, from ancient stone arches like the Arkadiko Bridge in Greece to today’s modern marvels, these structures have symbolised human progress. Yet not all bridges inspire comfort. Some, whether due to their dizzying heights, fragile construction, or dramatic locations, strike fear into even the bravest travellers. These precarious crossings remind us that adventure and danger often go hand in hand. Let’s take a closer look at some of the most dangerous bridges in the world.At first glance, the Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge looks quaint, but stepping onto it reveals just how precarious it is. Stretching only 66 feet (20 m), the bridge hangs almost 98 feet (30 m) above jagged rocks and turbulent waters. Traditionally used by fishermen to reach a small island, the bridge today is a popular tourist attraction. However, only a handful of people are allowed on it at once to prevent strain on its ropes. Crossing it is a test of balance, as even a light breeze can make it sway alarmingly.Also called the Long River Bridge, this modern suspension bridge is breathtaking in both design and height.Spanning 3,924 feet (1,196 m) with a deck suspended 920 feet (280 m) above the Long River, it is among the longest and highest bridges in the world. Drivers crossing it are rewarded with spectacular mountain views, but the sheer drop beneath can be intimidating. Strong winds in the region also add to the nerve-racking experience of crossing such an exposed structure, making it both a marvel of engineering and a thrilling challenge that attracts travellers, photographers, and adventure seekers from across the globe.Tucked inside Ghana’s Kakum National Park is a bridge unlike most others on this list. The Kakum Canopy Walkway is a series of rope and wooden walkways suspended between towering trees. Stretching 1,150 feet (350 m) in total, the canopy path hovers 160 feet (50 m) above the forest floor. It is one of only three such canopy bridges in Africa and gives visitors a unique perspective of the rainforest. However, the creaking planks and narrow ropes can make even confident walkers think twice before stepping on.France is home to the Millau Viaduct, a masterpiece of modern engineering that also induces fear in many drivers. This cable-stayed bridge rises to a structural height of 343 m, making it the tallest bridge in the world. Stretching across the Tarn Valley for 8,070 feet (2,460 m), it looks almost unreal as it disappears into the clouds. While safety systems are top-notch, the extreme height, wind gusts, and endless expanse below leave many with white knuckles as they drive across.Unlike the modern marvels, the Kazurabashi Bridge in Japan is rooted in tradition. Built using thick kiwi vines woven together, this footbridge spans 148 feet (45 m) across the Iya Valley at a height of 46 feet (14 m). Its uneven wooden planks, spaced widely enough for a foot to slip through, make crossing an adventure. The bridge sways with every step, and although it is reinforced today with steel cables, the thrill of walking across remains unchanged.Stretching across Tampa Bay in Florida, the Sunshine Skyway Bridge is both impressive and daunting. At 4.14 miles (6.7 km) long, it has become a vital transportation link. However, its history is marked by tragedy, including two maritime disasters in which ships collided with the bridge’s supports, leading to catastrophic collapses. The current structure, rebuilt with stronger safety measures, still evokes unease for drivers as they ascend its steep incline over the open water.High above the Arkansas River in Colorado lies the Royal Gorge Bridge, a suspension bridge that remains one of the highest in the world. Completed in 1929, it spans 955 feet (291 m) above the rushing river below. Once used for vehicles, it now carries pedestrians and thrill-seekers who dare to look down at the dizzying drop. The surrounding canyon adds to the drama, making it a bucket-list experience for those who enjoy testing their nerves.Few bridges are as visually striking, or intimidating, as the Zhangjiajie Glass Bridge in China.

Looking straight down beneath your feet to the deep valley below can be terrifying, even for those without a fear of heights. Designed to hold thousands of people at once, it is structurally strong, but psychologically, it pushes boundaries. The bridge has become a hotspot for tourists seeking a thrilling walk above the clouds.From ancient vine-woven crossings to ultra-modern glass walkways, these bridges represent both human ingenuity and our willingness to confront fear. They are reminders that bridges are not just functional structures, but also experiences that can test courage and stir adrenaline. While many of these dangerous bridges are tourist attractions today, their risks are real—whether it’s dizzying heights, swaying ropes, or windy mountain passes. Crossing them is as much about bravery as it is about travel, making each one unforgettable in its own way.","Bridges are feats of engineering that connect places once divided by rivers, valleys, or mountains. Yet not all bridges inspire comfort. Some, whether due to their dizzying heights, fragile construction, or dramatic locations, strike fear into even the bravest travellers.

No more paper! Oman residents can now legally use digital copies of their national IDs and driver’s licenses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/no-more-paper-oman-residents-can-now-legally-use-digital-copies-of-their-national-ids-and-drivers-licenses/articleshow/123901182.cms,"The Royal Oman Police officially recognizes certified digital national IDs and driver’s licenses across Oman/Representative Image

Digital IDs and driver’s licenses gain full legal status in Oman





Flexibility introduced with new expat residence cards in Oman





Renewal rules and compliance in Oman





Impact on citizens and residents: Digital identity in Oman





The Royal Oman Police (ROP) has made a significant stride in digital transformation by legally recognizing certified electronic versions of national ID cards and driver’s licenses. This new measure allows citizens and residents to access and use these documents online with the same legal validity as physical copies, simplifying daily procedures and aligning with Oman’s broader goals for government modernization and convenience.The Royal Oman Police has officially announced that certified electronic copies of the national ID card and driver’s license are now legally valid throughout Oman. These digital documents can be accessed directly via the ROP’s official website, eliminating the need to carry physical versions or visit service centers for many transactions. First Lieutenant Salem bin Saeed Al-Farsi, Project Manager for Digital Identity at ROP, confirmed that electronic documents hold equal legal weight as their hardcopy counterparts and can be used in all official situations, including when presenting identification to government authorities or police officers.This move marks an important milestone in Oman’s commitment to digital government services, enhancing convenience for both citizens and residents. The shift reduces paperwork, speeds up verification processes, and supports a streamlined approach to identity management.In parallel with the digital ID rollout, the Royal Oman Police recently introduced flexible residence cards for expatriates with validity periods ranging from one to three years. This update aims to provide greater flexibility and ease in the renewal process for the diverse expatriate population living in Oman.The introduction of these flexible residence permits comes alongside changes to the validity period of Omani citizens’ personal identity cards, which has been extended from the previous 10 years to match the duration of the Omani passport.Despite the extended validity and new formats, all residents and citizens must renew their residence cards and ID documents within 30 days of their expiration date to remain compliant with legal requirements. These renewal protocols are part of Oman’s broader efforts to modernize civil status laws and improve the efficiency of residency management.The government’s focus on updating these systems benefits Oman’s population by making document management more convenient and cost-effective, reflecting the ongoing commitment to digital transformation and public service improvement.With these updates, Oman’s residents and citizens are set to experience smoother administrative processes and greater ease in proving identity across the country. The move toward digital certified documents not only facilitates day-to-day interactions with government entities but also supports Oman’s vision for a fully digital, efficient, and modern public service infrastructure. The adoption of digital IDs empowers users with instant, secure access to essential documents, reducing wait times and enhancing overall service efficiency across Oman.In summary, Oman’s recognition of digital national IDs and driver’s licenses, along with the new flexible residence cards and extended validity periods, represent key steps toward a more accessible, secure, and user-friendly identity system for all who live in the Sultanate.","The Royal Oman Police (ROP) has made a significant stride in digital transformation by legally recognizing certified electronic versions of national ID cards and driver’s licenses.

Why authorities are so strict, the risk of tampering

Microchips



Holograms

Travellers flying from the UAE are being warned: even a slightly worn passport can now stop you from boarding. As immigration and airline checks tighten, minor wear and tear, such as frayed edges, water stains, or a scratched chip, is enough to get a valid passport rejected, regardless of visa status. Travelers are strongly encouraged to check their passports thoroughly before arriving at the airport to prevent unexpected issues and travel delays.International travellers departing from Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Sharjah are facing increased scrutiny over the physical condition of their passports. UAE-based airlines are now enforcing stricter rules, often stopping passengers at check-in if their passports show even minor damage, regardless of visa validity or passport expiry date.Common types of damage that can raise red flags include:Authorities say these issues, though sometimes minor, may compromise embedded security features such as microchips, holograms, and machine-readable zones. If these features are damaged, passport scanners may fail, leading to suspicion of forgery or tampering by immigration officers.Airlines departing from the UAE are also held accountable. If a passenger is denied entry due to passport condition, the airline may face penalties or be required to bear the cost of deportation.This has made airlines extra cautious at the check-in stage, often barring travellers with visibly damaged passports from boarding at all.While the UAE is leading this push for pristine passports, other countries are also enforcing similar measures. The following nations are particularly strict about the condition of travel documents:Officials generally split passport damage into two categories:Even a partially damaged passport can lead to denial of boarding or entry. Travellers are strongly advised to renew their passport at the first signs of wear, before problems occur. Prevention is key: keeping the document dry, using a protective cover, and avoiding inserting papers or folding the passport helps maintain its integrity.Modern passports are more than just identification; they are high-security documents embedded with:Damage to any of these features can cause technical issues at automated border control gates or manual inspection points. A passport that fails to scan correctly could appear tampered with, triggering suspicion and potential detainment.Officials emphasize that the strict enforcement is to protect national security and maintain document integrity. With the rise in identity fraud and document forgery, immigration systems are designed to flag any inconsistencies, no matter how small.","Even a tiny tear or water stain on your passport can lead UAE airlines and immigration to refuse boarding, despite a valid visa.

Whether you're moving to the UAE to advance your career, begin university, or apply for long-term residency like the Golden Visa, one document is key to unlocking your future: the Certificate of Equivalency. Issued by the UAE Ministry of Education, this official document confirms that your foreign academic qualifications match the country's educational standards. Without it, opportunities can be delayed or even denied. Here’s everything you need to know who needs it, why it matters, and how to get it.A Certificate of Equivalency, also known as a Certificate of Recognition, is a formal document issued by the UAE Ministry of Education (MoE) to verify that a degree earned outside the UAE is equivalent to the country’s academic benchmarks.This certificate proves that:You must obtain an Equivalency Certificate if you're:Even if you have years of experience or hold senior roles, your degree needs to be recognized locally before you can legally practice, study, or be employed in many sectors in the UAE.As of November 1, 2024, all certificate equivalency services in the UAE are now handled by the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MoHESR).

"Ramadan in UAE: Essential rules, etiquette, and legal guidelines every expat should know",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/ramadan-in-uae-essential-rules-etiquette-and-legal-guidelines-every-expat-should-know/articleshow/123866301.cms,"During Ramadan in the UAE, expats must avoid eating, smoking, and wear modest clothing in public/Representative Image

Public behavior and legal restrictions during fasting hours

From sunrise to sunset, it is not permitted to eat, drink, smoke, or chew gum in any public area — including streets, cars, malls, cinemas, and workplaces.

This applies to everyone, including non-Muslims, and includes even when you are inside a vehicle.

Federal Law No. 3 of 1987, amended in 2006, clearly addresses this under Article 313: Anyone caught eating, drinking, or smoking in public during fasting hours may face up to one month in jail or be fined AED 2,000.

Eating or drinking is only allowed in private spaces, such as your home, hotel room, or private office cabin.

The law and social norms are aligned in promoting respect for the fasting public, so even non-Muslims are expected to comply fully during daylight hours.



Dress, music, and public decorum during ramadan

Clothing should be modest and non-revealing throughout the month, especially in public places like restaurants, malls, and events.

Wearing tight or revealing outfits is strongly discouraged, even when attending dinners or nightlife venues.

Playing loud music — whether in your car, at home, or on the beach — should be avoided. Listening to music privately is allowed, but make sure it cannot be heard outside. On the beach or in shared spaces, use headphones to avoid disturbing others.

These practices reflect the general expectation of modesty and quiet reflection during Ramadan.



Navigating work, traffic, and meal timings during ramadan

Working hours across the UAE are shortened during Ramadan, with many offices closing earlier than usual.

This also impacts traffic patterns, with peak congestion often occurring: In the morning (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM) In the afternoon (1:00 PM to 3:00 PM)

Roads become especially busy before Iftar (sunset), as people hurry home to break their fast.

Avoid driving close to sunset if possible, as roads can be chaotic and hazardous at that time.

Adapting your schedule to these changes helps ensure respect and convenience during Ramadan

Restaurants tend to be very crowded after sunset, when families and groups gather for Iftar.

Make reservations in advance to secure a spot for dinner during this time.



Community engagement, charity, and social conduct

It is appropriate and appreciated to greet people with phrases like “Ramadan Kareem” or “Ramadan Mubarak” during the month.

Charity is a central value of Ramadan. Residents and visitors are encouraged to: Contribute to humanitarian programs Support local and international charities Make small gestures of kindness toward the less fortunate

The month is also a time to engage in community and cultural exchanges.

Whether Muslim or non-Muslim, everyone is encouraged to reflect on values such as tolerance, compassion, and gratitude.

Interacting respectfully with neighbors, friends, and colleagues is part of embracing the spirit of the month.

Honoring Ramadan etiquette ensures a respectful and harmonious experience for everyone.





During the holy month of Ramadan, daily life in the UAE undergoes a noticeable shift. This period is marked by fasting, prayer, and reflection for Muslims — but also brings important cultural and legal expectations for non-Muslim residents and tourists. Whether you’re living in the Emirates or visiting during Ramadan, knowing how to respectfully navigate public behavior, work routines, and social interactions is essential. Here’s a complete guide to what’s expected.","During Ramadan in the UAE, expats must avoid eating, smoking, and wear modest clothing in public.

A video of Indian devotees performing Ganesh Visarjan in a river in the United Kingdom has gone viral on social media as video sparked both admiration and criticism on online.The visuals show a group of devotees in traditional attire carrying a Ganesh idol on a boat and immersing it in the river, which was on Instagram by user @sandeep_anthwal. The immersion of the Ganesh idol was carried out vibrantly on the beats of the dhol in a ritualistic manner.Ganesh Visarjan, which marks the culmination of the ten-day Ganesh Utsav, is observed across India with grand processions and massive public gatherings.While many users hailed the viral video as a heartwarming display of culture abroad, others raised concerns over the environmental impact of immersing idols in natural water bodies.“This is such a beautiful display of tradition, it feels like home away from home,” one user commented. Another countered, “Why are people polluting rivers abroad in the name of tradition?”Some viewers were captivated by the presence of swans in the frame. “Watching the swans swim so close to the idol is magical,” commented another.Ganesh Utsav, celebrated widely across India, involves bringing home idols of Lord Ganesh, worshipping them for ten days, and immersing them in rivers, lakes or seas on the final day. In recent years, several Indian states have encouraged the use of eco-friendly idols and artificial immersion tanks to minimise harm to the environment.The UK video, however, has opened up a fresh debate on how such traditions are carried out overseas, with the diaspora community striving to preserve cultural practices while facing scrutiny over their ecological impact.",Ganesh Visarjan marks the culmination of the ten-day Ganesh Utsav.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

How hackers used ChatGPT to create fake ID cards



Apple Watch Ultra 3, Series 11 & SE 3 – Which One Should You Buy?





A suspected North Korean hacking group has used ChatGPT to create a deepfake of a South Korean military ID card, a report claims. According to cybersecurity researchers, these fake IDs was reportedly used to make a phishing attempt more credible by linking to malware that could extract data from the recipient's device. The cyber-espionage unit, which researchers have dubbed Kimsuky, is suspected of being sponsored by North Korea and has been linked to other spying efforts against South Korean targets. The US Department of Homeland Security previously stated that Kimsuky is likely tasked by the North Korean regime with a global intelligence-gathering mission. The details were published in a report by the South Korean cybersecurity firm Genians.During their investigation into forged identification documents, Genians researchers tested ChatGPT. While the system initially refused to generate a government ID (which is illegal under South Korean law) however, adjusting the prompt allowed the restriction to be bypassed.Mun Chong-hyun, director at Genians said that the broader trend shows how attackers are turning to AI for tasks such as planning attacks, developing malware, creating hacking tools, and impersonating recruiters.In July, cybersecurity firm Genians shared its latest findings on signs of suspected North Korean operatives using AI in intelligence-gathering.Later on, in August, Anthropic reported that North Korean hackers had leveraged its Claude Code tool to secure remote jobs at US Fortune 500 tech companies. The AI system assisted them in crafting fake identities, passing coding tests, and even delivering technical work once hired.Earlier, in February, the company said it had banned accounts linked to North Korea that were using its service to generate fraudulent resumes, cover letters, and social media content to support recruitment schemes.Recent phishing attempts targeted South Korean journalists, researchers, and human rights activists focusing on North Korea. Emails appeared to come from an address ending in .mli.kr, mimicking a South Korean military domain. The number of victims remains unclear.US officials have long accused North Korea of running cyber operations, cryptocurrency theft, and IT contracting schemes to collect intelligence and generate revenue. Washington alleges that the funds support Pyongyang’s efforts to evade sanctions and advance its nuclear weapons program.","Hackers used ChatGPT to create a deepfake of a South Korean military ID card.
