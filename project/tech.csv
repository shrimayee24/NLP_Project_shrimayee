Clocking out, calling it out: How three generations are quietly (and not-so-quietly) redefining office life





“What’s one workplace habit from older generations that absolutely baffles you?”

“Being ready to be there for the company whenever it demands.”

“Always comparing who does more work and who doesn't, mostly in a fun way but it gets you sometimes.”

Yes. I don’t care.

Walk into any corporate office today, and you’re likely to witness a scene that feels less like a workplace and more like a group project assigned by the universe. On one end of the floor, a Boomer is carefully crafting an email that begins with “Dear Team,” while a GenZ intern is wondering why the email wasn’t simply replaced by a three-second voice note. In between them sits a Millennial, holding a reusable coffee cup and the emotional weight of being sandwiched between two generations who insistwere raised the hard way.Welcome to the modern office: a place where three generations collide daily, armed with their own communication styles, work philosophies, and deeply held opinions. For example, whether “…” at the end of a message is a passive-aggressive statement or simply a grammatically correct continuation. It’s a space where Boomers are still trying to understand why anyone needs a “mental health day,” Millennials are trying to avoid burnout for the third time this quarter, and GenZ is trying to figure out how to turn their hobby into a side hustle during lunch break.While all three cohorts technically have the same job descriptions, they often approach work like they’re playing different levels of the same video game. Boomers operate by the rulebook, because of course therea rulebook, and have mastered the fine art of surviving long meetings without blinking.Millennials rely on collaboration, Google Docs, and the burning desire to appear competent at all times. GenZ, meanwhile, is speedrunning corporate life with tabs open to both the shared drive and Instagram reels.Yet for all their differences, what makes this intergenerational mash-up particularly entertaining is just how much each group believes the others are a little bit unusual. Boomers think Millennials take too many notes. Millennials think Boomers send emails like they’re writing novels. GenZ thinks everyone sends too many emails altogether.Still, somehow, work gets done. Projects are completed, presentations are delivered, and HR quietly updates its conflict-resolution guidelines every quarter. What looks like chaos from the outside is, in reality, a delicate balancing act: Boomers bring consistency, Millennials bring efficiency, and GenZ brings innovation with a dash of existential comedy.So if you’ve ever wondered why the office feels like a sitcom missing its laugh track, you’re simply witnessing the daily dance of three generations doing their best to navigate a changing work culture, one shared spreadsheet and misunderstood emoji at a time.Baby Boomers or Boomers, Millennials and Generation Z are often spoken about in shorthand, but each group comes with its own backstory and work style shaped by the times they grew up in. Baby Boomers, born roughly between 1946 and 1964, are the only generation officially defined by a government body, the US Census Bureau, named after the post–World War Two surge in births, as cited by the BBC. In the workplace, they’re known for being committed, self-sufficient and competitive, traits that perhaps come from growing up in a crowded, fast-growing world where standing out mattered.Millennials, born approximately between 1980 and the mid-1990s, are the most debated and stereotyped generation, often unfairly labelled as “lazy” or frivolous. In reality, they were the first true digital natives, growing up alongside the internet, which made them confident, curious and highly self-reliant.GenZ, the youngest cohort, includes those born in the late 1990s or early 2000s and has never known a world without smartphones, social media or constant connectivity. Often called iGen, they are ambitious, tech-savvy and confident, entering workplaces with fresh expectations and an instinctive comfort with digital tools. Together, these generations bring very different perspectives to the same office floor, shaped not just by age, but by history, technology and the worlds they grew up navigating.When asked,Aastha Jha, a member of Generation Z, didn’t hesitate:Soumya Banerjee, working in an IT firm, shared a different frustration. He pointed to a familiar pattern he’s noticed among seniors:The woes of a millennial are quite different. On asked how it feels to be sandwiched between the boomers and GenZs, Natasha said, “while millenials have been at the end of Boomer toxic culture, it is a nice spot to be in. While we have grown up listening to stories about the times they had to work during serious physical illnesses, the humour of a GenZ asking for a leave because they 'are not feeling the vibes' is not lost on you. ”Sneha had a simple answer for the question of whether she had ever felt judged for logging off exactly on time:When a Boomer was asked, 'what is the biggest change you have noticed in workplace culture?', the response reflected decades of experience: “There has been a big change in workplace culture in 20–25 years, and most of the changes have been for the better. The pace of work has increased, and people have adapted to that pace. Twenty-five years ago, no matter which sector you were working in, the availability of technological tools was not as easy. There was no AI, social media, or even computers were not as actively used as they are currently. So the pace has increased due to new technology being introduced. And secondly, you have a younger workforce in every field. People have been taking up responsibilities that could only be taken by someone senior.”Coming from someone who has been part of the workforce for the past 30 years, the reflection highlights how technology and a younger workforce have reshaped how fast work gets done.He also noted that the younger generation needs to develop 'ownership of work', something that they can learn from the work ethics of the older generation. ""People do a lot of work, but at times, you feel that there is no ownership of that specific work,"" he said.HR professionals, on the other hand, today find themselves acting as cultural interpreters, peacekeepers as they navigate the competing expectations of all three generations. They must balance Boomers’ preference for structure and visibility with Millennials’ need for flexibility and Gen Z’s insistence on boundaries and mental well-being.This often means redesigning policies, rewriting communication norms, and mediating misunderstandings that arise from everything from email etiquette to attitudes toward overtime. For HR, the challenge isn’t choosing sides, it’s creating a workplace ecosystem where all three generations feel heard, respected, and able to collaborate without turning every team meeting into a generational tug-of-war.When asked whether the recruitment strategy has undergone any significant changes to accommodate younger professionals, Karan , an HR executive, said, “The strategy has undergone a significant transformation, now prioritising Authenticity and Investment in Marketability to secure the newest wave of talent. Messaging focuses less on abstract corporate rhetoric and more on demonstrating the company's commitment to tangible skill development and job security, appealing directly to the risk-averse nature of younger professionals. Recruitment outreach is concentrated on high-engagement digital forums and specialised professional networks, employing candid employee testimonials to convey a transparent, genuine culture.”He also explains that for Millennials, staying with a company often depends on seeing a clear, fast-paced career path and knowing the organisation is genuinely committed to social impact through its CSR or ESG efforts. When it comes to older professionals, he says the key is to position them in meaningful advisory roles and provide strong technical support, so their deep experience and institutional knowledge remain an active part of the company’s modern, hybrid way of working.Ultimately, the generational divide in today’s workplaces is less about conflict and more about coexistence in transition. Boomers, Millennials, and GenZ are all responding to the same pressures, faster work, changing technologies and evolving ideas of success, just in different ways, shaped by their experiences. As offices continue to adapt, the challenge is not to declare one generation “right” and another “wrong,” but to find common ground where experience meets adaptability and ambition meets balance. As work culture evolves, offices have the chance to become spaces that value both productivity and people, whether that’s through a formal “Dear Team,” a sharp log-off, or a “no vibes today” day off.","Baby Boomers, Millennials and Generation Z are often spoken about in shorthand.

Connor McDavid's Lifestyle IS NOT What You Think

Why Porsche 911 GT2 RS stands as Connor McDavid’s favorite ride

Connor McDavid's car collection, the mere mention of it can open up a whole new world for auto enthusiasts. You can't help but be intrigued when a skater known for his astonishing quickness owns the most luxurious cars in the world.

The pure drama of his Lamborghini Huracán—chouette, loud, and ready to totally erase the road—adds personality to his garage.The Audi R8, with its V10 elegance and grace, may be cold but still very precise, could be wrangling. For a choice of luxury SUVs, he prefers the Range Rover Vogue, which can offer him maximum class and comfort combined with very light capability.The Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 is McDavid's car that radiates sounds; however, it's the American muscle car that provides supercharged vigor and finely-tuned road presence. Then there is the Ford F-150 Raptor, the beast that proves McDavid is not afraid of getting dirty off the road. The Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG, on the other hand, is the one that adds drama to the collection; its characteristic gullwing doors and powerful V8 engine are visually striking and lend the impression of being almost a character in the collection.Out of all the cars in his collection, the Porsche 911 GT2 RS is undoubtedly Connor McDavid’s favorite, according to several sources—the absolute choice for those who want nothing but the best in performance. Thanks to its track-oriented design, it has extremely precise control, and it produces massive power—basically a machine for sportspeople who love speed not only as a mere idea but as a way of life.

Rewards and Final Tips for Fighting Gigantamax Snorlax in Pokemon GO

We can encountertoday, Sunday, December 14, 2025, dominating Power Spots from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. local time in a limited three-hour Max Battle Day. This is one of the most rewarding Max events to date, blending shiny hunting, massive XP gains, and high-end resource farming into a single afternoon.For trainers chasing progression rather than just Pokédex entries, this event is tailor-made. With boosted Max Particles, large-scale group battles of up to 40 players, and some of the best Stardust and XP payouts available in Max Battles, Gigantamax Snorlax offers both efficiency and spectacle in equal measure.Gigantamax Snorlax in Pokemon GO appears exclusively at Power Spots as a Tier 6 Max Battle. Each entry costs 800 Max Particles, which are refunded only if you win. Power Spots refresh frequently throughout the event, encouraging fast chaining of battles.From midnight until the event ends, trainers benefit from reduced adventuring distance for Max Particle collection, 8x Max Particles from Power Spots, and doubled particles from exploration.Timed Research running since December 8 rewards Dynamax Machop encounters, Candy, and Max Particles to help players prepare optimal counters.An optional Ultra Ticket priced at $4.99 boosts the Max Particle cap to 5,600, grants double XP from Max Battles (up to 100,000 XP per fight with a Lucky Egg), and provides extra trades for those coordinating remotely. Shiny Gigantamax Snorlax is available, with catch CP ranging from 1760 to 1843 at Level 20, with 1843 representing a perfect IV.As a pure Normal-type Pokémon, Gigantamax Snorlax in Pokemon GO is only weak to Fighting-type moves and completely resists Ghost-type attacks. It uses no Fast Moves, allowing players to freely spam theirs to build the Max Meter quickly.The boss has two Charged attacks: an undodgeable AoE move that hits all active Pokémon, and a powerful single-target attack that deals double damage but provides a visual cue for dodging. Successfully avoiding this attack is key to keeping attackers alive in smaller groups.Machamp is the undisputed MVP of this event, especially Shadow, Mega, or Dynamax variants. Powering counters to Level 30+ and maximizing Max Attack significantly improves Dynamax damage output.Ideal groups split into subteams of four: two attackers led by Machamp, one tank such as Dynamax Blissey or Gengar, and one healer using Blissey with Max Spirit or Max Guard at Level 3. Focus exclusively on Fast Attacks until Dynamax activates.Sixteen to twenty trainers is the practical minimum, while full 40-player lobbies clear battles fastest. Shields activate during Dynamax phases, drawing boss damage away from attackers. Rotate Dynamax users to preserve damage dealers, and use Max Mushrooms to double Dynamax damage when running smaller groups.Each successful battle awards 25,000 XP, 25,000 Stardust, one Rare Candy XL, 30 Snorlax Candy, one Candy XL, and 10 Premier Balls. Lucky Eggs and Star Pieces double XP and Stardust, making this one of the best grind windows of the season.Chain battles efficiently, coordinate via Discord for remote teams, and farm multiple Snorlax for Candy XL and Max Particle returns. While Gigantamax Snorlax has niche Max Battle utility, today’s real value lies in the rewards and they are massive.","Gigantamax Snorlax in Pokemon GO appears exclusively at Power Spots as a Tier 6 Max Battle.

Ethan Klein claps back at Frogan’s Twitch complaints about streaming and mods,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/ethan-klein-claps-back-at-frogans-twitch-complaints-about-streaming-and-mods/articleshow/125954153.cms,"Image Via Instagram

“And Twitch streaming sucks. I fucking hate it.”

“lazy reaction”

Ethan Klein pushes back on Frogan’s Twitch rant about streaming, mods, and mental health

“I’ve been paying my mods for years btw.”





Twitch streamer Frogan recently went on an emotional stream to discuss the personal toll of content creation. She revealed that the year has been extremely challenging, citing depression, stress, and financial strain. Frogan explained she streamed only about 100 days in 2025 and described how legal battles, including a lawsuit from YouTuber Ethan Klein, have made it difficult to afford basic things, like holiday travel home. She also vented about paying her moderators out of pocket despite struggling with subscriber numbers, bluntly stating,Her candid remarks drew a sympathetic response from viewers and sparked wider conversation online.The tension between Frogan and Klein is part of a larger legal dispute. In June 2025, Klein’s company, Ted Entertainment, filed copyright lawsuits against Frogan, Denims, and Kaceytron. He alleges that they used substantial portions of his video Content Nuke – Hasan Piker with minimal commentary or transformative input, which he argues falls short of fair use. Klein’s goal is to distinguish between fair commentary and what he callsstreams that simply rebroadcast content with little added value.Critics, including political streamer Hasan Piker, have accused Klein of overreach and using copyright law against smaller creators.After Frogan’s stream gained attention, Ethan Klein reposted a clip on his Instagram Story with the caption:His response directly addressed Frogan’s claims about unpaid moderation and highlighted a broader debate about the financial and emotional realities of streaming. The exchange underscores the divide between creator expectations, fair compensation practices, and the pressures of producing content under legal scrutiny, while also drawing attention to how conflicts between smaller and larger creators can quickly become public and polarizing within the online community.Frogan’s emotional disclosure and Klein’s rebuttal have intensified discussions around streaming culture, mental health, and copyright in reaction content. While Frogan faces personal and financial challenges amplified by the lawsuit, Klein is focused on clarifying legal boundaries for derivative work on platforms like Twitch, sparking a larger conversation about how creators balance creative freedom with legal accountability.Also Read: xQc checks Google Trends against Hasan and is shocked by unexpected China interest","Twitch streamer Frogan recently went on an emotional stream to discuss the personal toll of content creation.

“don’t claim”

xQc roasts Hasan after spotting China traffic in Google Trends

“trying”

“everybody’s googling Hasan’s dog,”

“diabolical,”





During a recent livestream, xQc once again turned a casual on-stream moment into a viral talking point after pulling up Google Trends to compare his search popularity against other major creators, including Hasan. What started as a lighthearted numbers check quickly escalated when xQc switched the data to a worldwide view and noticed unexpected spikes from regions like China. The discovery immediately caught him off guard and set the tone for a string of jokes aimed directly at Hasan, with xQc suggesting the attention didn’t mean what it appeared to mean on the surface.The moment resonated with viewers because it combined internet metrics, creator rivalry, and ongoing streamer drama into one unfiltered reaction. As xQc scrolled through the data live, he mocked the idea that Hasan was gaining organic traction in China, sarcastically declaring that Chinese audienceshim. The chat erupted as xQc leaned into the bit, framing the results as less about genuine popularity and more about controversy-driven curiosity, something he’s repeatedly accused Hasan of benefiting from.Digging deeper into the Google Trends comparison, xQc framed the China-related search interest as part of a broader joke about Hasan’s recent attempts to connect with Chinese audiences. Hasan has faced criticism and censorship issues tied to China-focused content in the past, turning those efforts into a recurring meme within streaming circles. xQc leaned into that context, suggesting Hasan wasto reach that audience while not actually being embraced by it, at least in his view.The roast didn’t stop there. xQc followed up with another jab, claiming that any spike in Hasan’s search interest wasn’t really about Hasan at all. Instead, he joked thatreferencing the long-running controversy involving Hasan’s dog, Kaya, and accusations surrounding the use of a shock or vibration collar. xQc has repeatedly criticized Hasan over the issue in previous streams, and he framed the Google Trends bump asimplying people were searching for the scandal rather than the streamer.As with many xQc moments, the segment blended humor, rivalry, and real-time data in a way that instantly clipped well and spread across social media. While clearly exaggerated for entertainment, the comments tapped into existing narratives around Hasan’s controversies and global reach.In the end, the Google Trends check wasn’t about statistics as much as spectacle. xQc turned a simple analytics tool into another viral roast, reinforcing how quickly streamer rivalries can turn even search data into content fuel.Also Read: Kick faces potential nationwide ban in France after Jean Pormanove’s on-stream death"," xQc roasts streamer Hasan after spotting China traffic in Google Trends.

Shocking Image of President Sparks Health Frenzy On Social Media

Is the picture real?





Amid swirling questions about President Donald Trump’s health, a new photo has gone viral — sparking fresh speculation and leaving many wondering whether the President is truly well.Trump with a walker.Yes, the picture of the US President walking with the walker in a hallway of the White House. In that photo, he was looking up and appearing to lean forward using a walker.Several users sharing the photo online, claimed that the image came hours after Trump signed an executive order banning states from regulating AI.A user said, ""It looks like an image has leaked showing Donald Trump using a walker moments after he signed an executive order banning states from regulating AI.""Another user shared Trump's picture with Golden walker and said, ""Trump gold-plates his walker, officially making it the first mobility aid with a higher net worth than his voter base.""As the picture is going viral, people are trying to understand whether it is real or fake.Several users on social media claimed that the photo is fake. Even the walker with golden plates just justify the claims.When asked the Chat GPT, whether the photo is real or fake, the AI analysed the photo, and said that the walker’s structure looks slightly off, the carpet pattern in the hallway appears a bit “muddled,"" background figures have slightly soft or ambiguous facial details, which is common in AI-generated images and lighting on the central figure is very even and almost “studio-like,” while the lighting in the hallway is more diffused—not fully consistent.The final conclusion: ""The image shows several subtle inconsistencies typical of AI-generated photos. It leans more toward being AI-generated than a genuine photograph.""","A new photo of President Donald Trump using a walker has gone viral.

"Why robotics pioneer, the Roomba co-creator, is skeptical about his field",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-robotics-pioneer-the-roomba-co-creator-is-skeptical-about-his-field/articleshow/125956719.cms,"



In the 1980s, limitations on computing constrained robot development. Watching insects, pioneering roboticist Rodney Brooks realised that they possessed little brainpower but were far more capable than his robots, and that mimicking animal biology was smarter than trying to control every aspect of a robot’s behaviour through code. His successes led him to predict robots “everywhere in our world.”At 70, the former MIT lab director and a co-creator of the popular Roomba robot vacuum lives in that world. But Brooks, who has spent his career making intelligent machines a part of everyday life, finds himself playing the skeptic.Today’s entrepreneurs promise robots that not only look human — or human-ish — but can also do everything a person can. Tech investors are pouring billions into the effort, but Brooks argues that general-purpose humanoid robots will not be coming home soon, and that they are not safe enough to be around humans.In Sept, he delivered a takedown in an essay that concluded that over the next 15 years, “a lot of money will have disappeared, spent on trying to squeeze performance, any performance, from today’s humanoid robots. But those robots will be long gone and mostly conveniently forgotten.”His blog post kicked off a furore in the small world of robotics. This was a legend in the field, whose insights had informed the humanoid craze.“At least a dozen people asked me if I agreed with it shortly after it went live (I don’t),” wrote Chris Paxton, a researcher in AI and robotics.Brooks remembers German technologist Ernst Dickmanns’ self-driving car, which began motoring across Europe in 1987. He was around when IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer defeated chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997, and when AI researcher Geoff Hinton predicted in 2016 that radiology would be obsolete in five years because machine learning software could do it better. All of these were important developments, but drivers, chess players and radiologists are still among us.Brooks insists he is simply being practical. “We’re going to go through a big hype, and then there’s going to be a trough of disappointment,” he said in an interview.The physical appearance of a robot, Brooks likes to say, makes a promise about what it can do. Robots in wide use today are designed for specific jobs in specific situations, and look like it — an arm that does the same repetitive action on a manufacturing line, or the automated pallet movers in Amazon warehouses. They aren’t flashy. “People see the humanoid form,” he said, “and they think it’s going to be able to do everything a human can. ”Brooks said he wouldn’t get within three feet of a humanoid bot. If — when, he says — they lose balance, the powerful mechanics that make them useful make them dangerous.The current humanoid craze is “kind of his fault,” said Anthony Jules, Brooks’ co-founder and CEO at Robust.AI, which is building automated carts for distribution centres. Jules was an MIT undergrad in the 1990s when Brooks was leading the school’s Computer Science and AI Laboratory — helping create the algorithms behind today’s autonomous cars, pioneering the feedback loops that link AI and robotics.Brooks, who grew up in Australia, arrived at Adelaide’s Flinders University in 1972 at the same time as academic refugees fleeing the end of the Prague Spring, allowing him to receive a “classical Eastern European mathematics education.” He spent 12 hours each Sunday futzing around with the university’s only mainframe computer. He cofounded his first AI startup in 1984 while teaching at Stanford.Brooks is particularly skeptical that neural networks are ready to solve the dexterity problem. Humans don’t have a language for gathering, storing and communicating data about touch. In his view, the visual data preferred by the new guard of robot startups simply won’t be able to re-create what we can do with our fingers.“My students have built lots of hands, my students have built lots of arms, shipped tens of thousands of robot arms,” Brooks said. “I’m very convinced that humanoid robots are not going to have human-level manipulation.”Brooks would say he is a realist, not a pessimist. His main worry is that too much focus on the trendiest training techniques will leave other promising ideas neglected. He expects that robots will someday work alongside people, and that we may even refer to them as humanoid — but they will be on wheels, he says, and have multiple arms and probably won’t be general purpose.He works above the mock-up warehouse in San Carlos, California, where Robust’s robots learn their trade, but he expects to retire in the next few years. Then, Brooks plan to write a book about the nature of intelligence, and why humans won’t create it artificially for another 300 years.","Former MIT lab director and a co-creator of the popular Roomba robot vacuum lives in that world.

‘Imagine the smell’: Why Cline AI head’s anti-India comment was neither a joke nor neutral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/imagine-the-smell-why-cline-ai-heads-anti-india-comment-was-neither-a-joke-nor-neutral/articleshow/125952352.cms,"

What actually happened

A phrase with a long and ugly history

Intent versus impact is not an equal debate

Corporate responses and unresolved questions

Why this was never just about a joke





When a single-line reply under a hackathon photo set off a storm on X, many outside the Indian and South Asian tech community initially dismissed the reaction as overblown. The phrase was short, vague and, to some, easily explained away as a crude joke about long hours and crowded rooms. But for many Indians in tech, the comment landed very differently. It touched a nerve shaped by years of stereotypes, coded insults and experiences that make certain words anything but neutral.The controversy began when a photograph from a high-profile hackathon was shared on X, showing a large crowd of developers and engineers. In response, Nik Pash, Cline’s head of AI, replied with the phrase “imagine the smell.” Almost immediately, Indian and South Asian users pointed out that the phrase is widely recognised online as a racist meme aimed at their community.As criticism mounted, Pash defended the remark as a harmless joke about hackathons and refused to apologise. “I’m not going to apologise for making a harmless joke about hackathons smelling bad,” he wrote, adding that he had attended several such events that year and that “they all smelled bad.”That stance intensified the backlash. Prominent voices in the tech ecosystem stepped in to explain publicly why the phrase carried racial meaning regardless of intent. Deedy Das, an Indian-origin tech investor, put it bluntly: “Every time I’ve seen ‘imagine the smell’, it’s an attack on Indians.” His point, echoed by many others, was not about reading malice into every joke, but about recognising how certain phrases function online.The discussion escalated rapidly, alongside legitimate criticism, there were also instances of harassment and threats, which many critics condemned outright. Only after sustained public pressure did Saoud Rizwan, the founder and chief executive of Cline, issue a statement. He distanced the company from the comment and acknowledged that harm had been caused, while emphasising that the remark was not intended to offend.The reaction was not driven by hypersensitivity to humour. “Imagine the smell” is widely recognised online as a racist meme used to mock Indians and South Asians, particularly in tech and gaming spaces. For years, the phrase has circulated alongside stereotypes about hygiene, food and overcrowding, often functioning as a way to demean Indian professionals while preserving plausible deniability.One of the most persistent tropes behind it is the idea that Indians “smell like curry”, a stereotype that has followed South Asians for decades across schools, workplaces and popular culture. From playground taunts to office jokes and anonymous comment sections, food, spices and bodies are collapsed into a single insult, implying uncleanliness and otherness. Indian media commentary has repeatedly traced this trope to colonial-era attitudes that used hygiene and bodily difference as tools of racial hierarchy.Online forums make clear how common the association remains. Indian and South Asian users frequently describe encountering comments such as “smells like curry” or “imagine the smell” under unrelated photos or videos, often accompanied by emoji reactions meant to signal mockery rather than humour. The phrasing survives precisely because it allows users to retreat behind irony or alleged ambiguity when challenged.Because of that history, intent becomes secondary. When language is repeatedly used to target a specific group, it carries meaning even when the speaker claims a different context. For many Indians, the words do not arrive as a blank slate. They arrive loaded.Defenders of the comment focused heavily on intent, arguing that because it was not meant to be racist, it should not be treated as such. But this framing misunderstands how harm operates. Impact is shaped by repetition, power and context, not by a single explanation offered after the fact.For Indians in tech, the impact is cumulative. It is built from schoolyard taunts, online slurs, workplace jokes and the constant pressure to laugh along to avoid being labelled humourless or difficult. Viewed through this lens, the comment did not exist in isolation. It fit a familiar pattern.Calling out the phrase was not about punishing an individual. It was about naming a problem that is often minimised or ignored. Several Indian voices made the same point publicly: even if the comment was not intended as anti-India, its effect was indistinguishable from comments that clearly are.Cline’s response reflected a familiar corporate dilemma. Companies often move quickly to manage reputational fallout, but rarely go far enough in confronting the cultural assumptions that make such incidents possible. For many Indian professionals, the lingering question is not whether a statement was issued, but whether genuine understanding followed.Will future humour be filtered through an awareness of historical harm, or will each episode be treated as an isolated misunderstanding?At its core, the controversy was not about policing humour or enforcing ideological conformity. It was about who gets to define harm. Indians in tech are frequently cited as evidence of diversity and meritocracy, yet their experiences are often discounted when they articulate discomfort.For many Indians, the phrase was never neutral because lived experience has taught them it rarely is. This does not mean every careless comment is malicious. It does mean that dismissing the reaction as oversensitivity ignores the way words accumulate meaning over time.The lesson from this episode is not that humour should vanish from tech culture. It is that context matters, history matters and listening matters. When those are ignored, even a few words can reveal far more than the speaker intended.","The controversy began when a photograph from a high-profile hackathon was shared on X, showing a large crowd of developers and engineers.

Social media vetting from December 15





As the State Department begins social media vetting of all visa applicants, primarily H-1B, H-4 but also students and other non-immigrant visas, immigration lawyer Brad Bernstein explained that now there is unlikely to be any instant visa approval and immigration officials will go through all social media profiles of a candidate -- looking for contradictions. If the social media profiles are locked, then there are chances that the visa request will be instantly canceled.Bernstein explained that immigration officials have been asked to check Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X, LinkedIn, Snapchat, but the scrutiny may not remain limited to these popular social media platforms. They may check any resume posted on the Internet, any blog in your name or a YouTube comment -- practically anything that comes up on the Internet on the applicant's name.The lawyer advised that applicants must fix any contradictions in their online profiles before the visa interview, after they make them public. They should also Google themselves to check what all comes up when their name is searched. ""They’re looking for inconsistencies, signs of immigrant intent that you may want to stay in the US looking for a Green Card, hostile statements about the United States, support for extremist groups, questionable work history, or signs that posts were deleted after filing,"" the lawyer said.""If your visa form says you are a full-time engineering student, but your LinkedIn shows freelance work or you are driving an Uber, now you have a credibility issue. You made a post somewhere or a comment: 'I can't wait to live in America forever', now you have an immigrant intent,"" Bernstein said, adding that applicants should not delete anything after filing as it would make things worse.Consular offices have been asked to go through the social media accounts of the visa applicants starting from December 15.

It started with a simple question —— and ended in full-blown comedy inside Pakistan’s National Assembly.During Monday’s session of the National Assembly in Islamabad, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq found ten PKR 5,000 notes on the chamber floor and called for the owner to identify them.“Whose money is this? Whoever it belongs to, please raise your hand,” the Speaker asked, waving the bundle of notes in the air.Within seconds, 12–13 MPs raised their hands to claim the money.

A pleasant and peaceful performance at Hangzhou Safari Park in East China’s Zhejiang Province on Saturday turned terrifying when a black bear suddenly attacked its keeper.Several videos are going viral on social media, showing audience members watching as two keepers guided two black bears onto the stage for another round of performance. One bear successfully performed, while the other, nearing the stage, pounced on its keeper and knocked him to the ground, Global News reported.The fallen keeper struggled to escape while nearby staff grabbed chairs and poles to separate the animal. After the bear was pulled away, it lunged at the keeper again, and staff had to use force to separate them.This footage prompted an online debate over whether animal performances should be banned. Other staff immediately intervened and used props to separate the bear from the keeper. Multiple social media users posted videos of the incident recorded during the bears’ show.The park explained that the incident occurred as the keeper was carrying a large bag of carrots and apples; the bear saw the bag, became excited, and pounced on the keeper in an attempt to get the food, according to the notice. The notice also stated that the keeper said the incident reminded him to be more careful in dealings with the bear in the future.The official social media account of Hangzhou Safari Park posted a notice on Saturday stating that neither the keeper nor the bear was injured.One user, Momo, on the China's social media platform commented, “Safety must be a priority, and we should have respect for animals. Never think of them as cute and docile, or that we can control them.”Another user, Zero Geqian Qianqian, also emphasised the need to focus on safety. Many others have called for the cancellation of animal performances. A user named “Don’t Call Me Ma Ma Ma” asked, “When will animal performances be canceled? Isn’t it in animals’ nature to be food-driven and protective of their food?”Some users expressed sympathy for the bear. A user named “The Girl is Out, I’m at Home” said, “A small bear is like a little baby. How could we make it perform? If it has apples, let it eat! If it were your child, would you make it perform first and then eat? If it’s hungry, then let it perform how to eat, it would be happier, the keeper and the bear would be more harmonious, and the audience would still enjoy it.”On the X also, several users commented on the video. One of the user said, ""I see why the Russians train with them 🤣🤣🤣 that bear is a professional grappler.""Another said, ""Maybe if we didn't lock these animals up for our own amusement they wouldn't attack people.""After the video of the bear attack went viral online and sparked debate, the park released a follow-up video showing that the bear and the keeper have since “reconciled.” While feeding the black bear carrots, the keeper gently petted its head and said, “If you want carrots, why did you snatch mine? [Even if you didn’t], I’ll still give you some.” The black bear stood calmly and ate peacefully, displaying a gentle demeanour.",A black bear suddenly attacked its keeper at Hangzhou Safari Park in East China's Zhejiang Province on Saturday.

UAE introduces new law to protect children without known parents,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-introduces-new-law-to-protect-children-without-known-parents/articleshow/125947580.cms,"Federal law in UAE ensures care and rights for parentless children / AI Generated Image

What the new law does for child rights?

Prioritizes “the best interests of the child” in care, custody, and upbringing decisions.

Creates an integrated care system that coordinates social, health, educational and psychological support for each child.

Protects children’s identity and privacy, helping them integrate positively into society, grow with dignity, and avoid stigma associated with their origins.

Child protection in the UAE

Ensuring access to essential services and opportunities regardless of a child’s parental status.

Standardizing care protocols so authorities and caregivers follow a unified, child-first approach across the nation.

Promoting integration into society, helping children grow with dignity, identity and opportunities equal to other residents.

UAE and ongoing initiatives





The UAE Government has issued Federal Decree-Law No. (12) of 2025, a major legal reform focused on children of unknown parentage, that is, children whose biological parents are not legally identified or known. This law strengthens how the country cares for vulnerable children and ensures they grow up in safe, stable environments.The decree is part of the UAE’s ongoing efforts to update its child welfare framework following decades of legislative activity, including the existing Child Rights Law (formerly known as Wadeema’s Law).The new law reframes how children without known parents are cared for and supported. It does the following:Under the reform, all decisions involving these children must reflect their physical, emotional and social needs, including access to education, healthcare and secure family environments.This law builds on the existing Child Rights Law (Federal Law No. 3 of 2016), which already guarantees a broad set of protections for all children in the UAE, including protection from neglect, abuse, exploitation and discrimination.Children with unknown parentage often face complex legal and social challenges, such as lack of documentation, unclear affiliation, and difficulty accessing services. The new law aims to remove these barriers by:Experts welcomed the move as a logical continuation of the UAE’s child welfare strategy, which prioritizes safety, health, education and emotional development for all children, from newborns to teenagers.The new law aligns with other efforts in the UAE to strengthen child rights and safety. The Child Rights Law (Wadeema’s Law) already protects children against abuse, neglect, and psychological harm, and places priority on family and safe environments for children.Local forums and initiatives, such as the Child Safety Forum in Sharjah, bring authorities and experts together to promote best practices in child protection. Updated personal status and family laws in the UAE have also placed children’s welfare at the heart of legal reforms, including custody, support and identity issues.These developments show the UAE is working on multiple fronts to create a comprehensive child protection ecosystem, not just for children with known families but also for the most vulnerable who lack parental identity.The UAE’s Federal Decree-Law No. (12) of 2025 marks a significant step in modernizing and strengthening child protection laws. By focusing on the best interests of children with unknown parents, and ensuring stable care, rights, and opportunity, the country reinforces its long-standing commitment to children’s welfare and social inclusion.","The UAE Government has issued Federal Decree-Law No. (12) of 2025, a major legal reform focused on children of unknown parentage.

RTA's immediate traffic impact

Why the work is happening?

Alternative roads and diversion

Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road (E311): This is the main parallel highway to Emirates Road. Motorists can transition to the E311 earlier in their journey, as it offers a vast network of interchanges that connect directly to areas like Al Barari, Dubai Investment Park (DIP), and ultimately the Jebel Ali area.

(E311): This is the main parallel highway to Emirates Road. Motorists can transition to the E311 earlier in their journey, as it offers a vast network of interchanges that connect directly to areas like Al Barari, Dubai Investment Park (DIP), and ultimately the Jebel Ali area. Sheikh Zayed Road (E11): While a much busier and more central route, the E11 runs closer to the coast and is often used as a long-distance alternative, particularly for those heading toward Jebel Ali Port or Abu Dhabi.

Dubai–Al Ain Road (E66): For traffic approaching the E611 from the eastern side of Dubai, the E66 serves as a critical connector. If the specific exit loops at the E611/Lehbab intersection are closed, drivers are advised to continue on the E66 and utilize the next available exit or interchange to double back or access local roads.

Al Yalayes Road (D57): This road is a high-capacity link, especially vital for commercial traffic moving from Jebel Ali Port and the surrounding Free Zone. It can be used to connect traffic between the Sheikh Zayed Road (E11) and the Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road (E311), effectively bypassing the core E611 work zone.





From Thursday, 11 December 2025, authorities will temporarily close the slip-road at Bridge No. 7 on Emirates Road for vehicles travelling from Ras Al Khaimah towards Al Dhaid. Motorists affected by the closure are being asked to use nearby alternatives such as Bridge No. 6 and the recently opened Khorfakkan Road Tunnel while the work is under way. The closure and diversion were publicly announced as part of traffic advisories issued on December 10.The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in Dubai issued a traffic alert announcing the immediate closure of a critical stretch on Emirates Road (E611). The closure specifically targeted the slip road used by northbound traffic heading towards the important Jebel Ali–Lehbab Road/Al Qudra Road junction.The work began on December 11, 2025, and was deemed essential to facilitate the complex construction required for a major upgrade project. Commuters traveling north on E611 who needed to exit at this point were immediately impacted and directed to use the newly implemented diversion routes signaled by the RTA.This closure is part of wider, phased improvements to the Emirates Road (E611) corridor designed to boost capacity and safety on one of the UAE’s main arterial routes.The stretch has been targeted for lane and interchange upgrades in a larger Dh750 million expansion plan launched earlier in 2025 that aims to increase lane capacity on key segments, shorten commute times and ease congestion for drivers travelling between Ras Al Khaimah, Umm Al Quwain, Sharjah and Dubai.That expansion includes widening lanes and upgrading interchange No. 7 with multiple new bridges, work planned to increase throughput and cut travel times sharply for long-distance commuters.For commuters whose primary route involves the E611 and requires an exit into the southern or western Dubai areas, several major arterial roads serve as primary alternatives, depending on the traveler's starting point:These detours were strategically planned to reroute vehicles around the construction zone, maintaining access to the critical roads which link key economic and residential districts, thus minimizing long-term disruption. This vital junction connects the major Emirates Road (E611) with the Jebel Ali-Lehbab Road and Al Qudra Road, making its smooth operation essential for the entire southern corridor of Dubai.",The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in Dubai issued a traffic alert announcing the immediate closure of a critical stretch on Emirates Road (E611) The closure specifically targeted the slip road used by northbound traffic heading towards the important Jebel Ali–Lehbab Road/Al Qudra Road junction.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125889079,imgsize-37730,width-400,resizemode-4/dubai-traffic.jpg"

Day 1 Abu Dhabi’s Bridge Summit

Idris Elba empowering Africa

$2.8 trillion revolution

‘Leapfrog’ advantage





Abu Dhabi’s BRIDGE Summit opened today (Dec 8, 2025), bringing together creators, platforms, investors and stars to map how AI, creators and global storytelling will reshape media. The three-day event mixes headliner keynotes, hands-on sessions and dealmaking, and the tone is unapologetically ambitious.The Bridge Summit 2025 officially kicked off today at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC), immediately setting a bold tone for the future of global media. Running for three days, the event has attracted a massive convergence of over 60,000 creatives, media specialists, artists, investors, and entrepreneurs.The scale is truly global, with more than 400 speakers, including policymakers and innovation leaders, and attendees from 182 countries.Organizers emphasized that the summit is designed to be the global industry’s new home, a dedicated space for forging high-value partnerships, developing production ecosystems, and exchanging expertise. As stated in the evocative opening film, the message is clear: ""Abu Dhabi is not looking toward the future; it is building it.""A major highlight was the panel featuring Hollywood superstar Idris Elba, who stated he views his own identity as a ""bridge"" between his heritage, the stories he tells, and global audiences. His core mission is to empower African creators and rewrite the continent's global narrative, which has long suffered from misrepresentation.Elba identified a critical issue: many African creators who achieve viral success are blocked from receiving earnings by banking restrictions and digital barriers. To solve this practical problem, he created Akunna (named after his middle name), a platform centered around the Akunna Wallet designed to ensure creators can actually be paid for their work.The opening sessions underscored the sheer economic power of the sector, noting that global media and entertainment generated over $2.8 trillion last year. The line between traditional creative fields is rapidly blurring; today, musicians are becoming developers, and filmmakers are building immersive digital worlds. Key discussions centered on technology, revealing that nearly 70% of content creators are already utilizing AI tools in their work.Speakers explored AI's promise for efficiency and scaling creativity, but also highlighted the associated risks to integrity, authorship, and truth. The consensus was that while AI is a powerful tool, the priority must be establishing frameworks to guide its ethical use and rebuild trust in an age of deepfakes and misinformation.Elba stressed that Africa has a unique advantage: the ability to ""leapfrog"" old infrastructure and build entirely new creative systems, citing the global success of Afrobeats as powerful proof. He argued that the potential for African gaming and fantasy is immense because it operates on a ""blank canvas.""However, he sharply criticized the lack of governmental support, pointing out that some African nations still do not have a dedicated film policy. His message to policymakers was direct: if you want a healthy creative ecosystem, you need infrastructure, distribution, and protection, not just conversation.He concluded that while AI is not the enemy, ""actual intelligence is more powerful than artificial intelligence,"" and requires strong frameworks to maintain authentic human creativity.Beyond panels, BRIDGE is a marketplace: organisers expect the summit to catalyse MoUs, studio deals and investment into production hubs and creative platforms. Abu Dhabi’s push to host the event signals a strategic shift, the emirate wants to be a media-tech crossroads that connects capital, talent and festivals.","The Bridge Summit 2025 officially kicked off today at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC) The event has attracted a massive convergence of over 60,000 creatives, media specialists, artists, investors, and entrepreneurs.

Madinah’s Taibah University action

Why this happened?

Advice for students and staff

What is Blackboard?





The academic routine at Taibah University in Madinah, Saudi Arabia , saw a sudden, mandatory shift this week, prioritizing the safety of its community over traditional classroom attendance. Taibah’s notice cites National Center of Meteorology reports as the reason for the suspension; students were directed to Blackboard for remote study instructions. The university announced the suspension of all in-person classes across its extensive network of campuses, immediately transitioning to a fully digital learning environment.The suspension of physical attendance applied comprehensively to the university’s main campus in Madinah and all of its subsidiary branches located throughout the wider Madinah region. This decision was specifically implemented for Monday, December 8, 2025. To ensure educational continuity without delay, all scheduled lessons and lectures were immediately converted to a distance learning format.The university confirmed that instruction would be conducted entirely through the established Blackboard system. This switch demonstrated the institution’s prepared infrastructure for managing disruptive events while upholding academic obligations.The critical reason behind the rapid change was a severe weather warning issued by the national meteorological body. The university’s announcement, reported by Al-Riaydh newspaper, was made following official reports from the National Center of Meteorology (NCM).These reports indicated the high probability of heavy rainfall across the area, posing a significant risk to commuters and campus safety. The primary motivation for the suspension, confirmed by university officials, was the deep concern for the safety of both students and administrative staff and faculty. The university affirmed that this pre-emptive step was taken in coordination with all relevant specialized authorities tasked with managing regional weather crises.Students and faculty should: (1) log into Blackboard before scheduled class times to confirm session links and any revised assessment arrangements; (2) follow Taibah University’s official social channels and the university portal for real-time notices; and (3) avoid travel to campus while alerts are active. The university’s message stresses that classes remain in session remotely, so attendance and coursework expectations continue as normal unless otherwise announced.Blackboard is Taibah University’s official online learning platform used to deliver classes, assignments, exams and course materials remotely. When in-person classes are suspended, Blackboard becomes the main way for students and teachers to continue lessons without interruption.Students can access Blackboard through the university portal or the mobile app. After logging in with their university ID, they can open each course page to find live class links, lecture recordings, assignments and announcements. Teachers may also upload new schedules or send messages about any changes. Students should keep notifications enabled and check their course dashboards regularly, especially during weather-related closures.The decision by Taibah University reflects a broader pattern of instability in the region's weather conditions. Contextual reports, including the Saudi Gazette, confirmed that the NCM had warned of a widespread rainy spell commencing around this time, affecting not only Madinah but also neighboring regions like the Makkah highlands.","Taibah University in Madinah, Saudi Arabia, suspended all in-person classes this week.

A city for everyone





Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has completed 595 new public bus passenger shelters across key locations, bringing the wider shelter project to about 89% completion of the target 762 units. The RTA says the rollout forms part of a long-term plan to modernise street-level public transport infrastructure and make waiting for buses more comfortable and reliable for everyone.The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in Dubai has reached a major milestone in modernizing the city’s public transport network, rolling out hundreds of state-of-the-art bus shelters. This ambitious initiative aims to construct a total of 762 sophisticated shelters by the end of 2025.To date, the project is near completion, with 595 shelters already installed, marking a substantial 89% overall progress. This upgrade is far more than an aesthetic facelift; it’s a pivotal step toward cultivating an integrated urban environment that supports sustainability and enhances the daily lives of residents and visitors.The strategic importance of this project is immense, as the bus network currently serves over 192 million passengers annually.To maximize efficiency and ridership, the RTA carefully selected locations based on future demand, high population density, and the need for integration with other ""soft mobility"" options. Many of the new stops are major hubs, designed to handle high volumes of traffic, with certain locations serving more than ten bus routes per shelter.The new shelters boast a sleek, contemporary aesthetic that perfectly complements Dubai’s modern architectural landscape. However, the true transformation lies in the user-friendly technology and comfort features integrated into the design.For stops classified as Primary Shelters (serving over 750 passengers daily), the RTA provides top-tier amenities:The RTA categorizes all 762 shelters into four tiers based on passenger volume to ensure appropriate amenity levels at every stop:In a move showcasing Dubai's focus on future technology, the RTA is also exploring the use of 3D printing technology for the construction of some shelters on a trial basis, blending functionality with cutting-edge innovation.H.E. Mattar Al Tayer, Director General and Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors of the RTA, emphasized the project's greater role, stating: “The new shelters represent a pivotal step in RTA's efforts to develop an integrated urban environment that encourages residents and visitors to use public transport, improves quality of life, and promotes comfort and well-being.”He added that ensuring the shelters combine modern design with services that guarantee a better mobility experience is key to reinforcing public confidence in the network and supporting long-term sustainability objectives, including emissions reduction.The initiative aligns with Dubai’s broader vision for inclusive urban development. The design of every new shelter is fully compliant with the Dubai Universal Design Code, ensuring complete accessibility for all community members. This focus includes dedicated, comfortable spaces specifically tailored for wheelchair users (People of Determination).This commitment to inclusivity supports the ""My Community … A City for Everyone"" initiative, launched by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai.",Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has completed 595 new public bus passenger shelters across key locations.

Among the services covered are:Domestic pilgrims can now easily use the card digitally through their mobile devices, while international visitors will receive a printed version upon arrival. This dual approach ensures broad accessibility and convenience for all pilgrims, regardless of their origin or technological comfort level.With the introduction of “Nusk Al-Umrah,” Saudi Arabia continues to modernize the pilgrimage experience, combining advanced technology with logistical planning to offer a safer, more convenient, and more connected journey for millions of worshippers each year.","Saudi Arabia has expanded the “Nusk’ card, now available digitally for residents within the Kingdom and in printed form for pilgrims arriving from abroad. “The card facilitates a number of direct services for pilgrims,” Abdul Aziz Al- Mutahmi said in a telephone interview.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125814691,imgsize-1735593,width-400,resizemode-4/hajj.jpg"

Nik Pash, who drew massive flak after he made an unsavory comment, ""Imagine the smell,"" on a photo of Indian coders, has apparently been removed from the company Cline.After the massive backlash, Nik Pash seems to have been withdrawn from the company as users share Cline company's founder Saoud Rizwan tweet, which has been deleted now, about firing the Company's AI Head .In a statement posted on X, Rizwan acknowledged that while he did not believe the executive’s original tweet was intentionally offensive, the refusal to apologise in its aftermath “does not reflect my position or Cline’s.”“He is no longer with Cline,” the CEO said, adding that the company recognised the hurt caused by the episode and that it “deserves acknowledgment and empathy.”Rizwan also condemned the harassment the former executive has reportedly faced since the controversy erupted. “While I disagreed with how he responded, nobody deserves the threats and abuse he’s received. Please leave him and his family in peace,” he wrote.The CEO ended his message with a direct apology: “To everyone who was hurt by this — I am sorry.”Earlier, Nik Pash issued a statement asserting that he would not apologize for making a 'harmless joke'.He said he had been to four hackathons this year and all of them smelled bad.His 'imagine the smell' comment to a jampacked hackathon photo of xAi was in the context of that but he said he received even death threats as some people on social media made it look like a racist comment.Pash also tagged Elon Musk and said X did not become the place that he wanted it to be -- to let people make jokes and have fun in peace. Pash attacked Indian-origin techie Deedy Das for adding fuel to the fire.The photo, which triggered the massive controversy, was posted by X user Taylor. ""A full audience of hardcore builders and engineers at the @xai hackathon!"" she wrote. The photo indeed showed a room full of men and women and many of them were visibly of Indian origin. As Pash commented, 'imagine the smell', it was seen as a jibe at Indians, as calling Indians smelly has become a part of regular anti-India/anti-South Asia hatred on social media.","Nik Pash, who drew massive flak after he made an unsavory comment, ""Imagine the smell,"" on a photo of Indian coders, has apparently been removed from the company Cline.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Meet Charlie Javice: Woman who scammed JP Morgan for $175M — but the bank is paying her $142M legal bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meet-charlie-javice-woman-who-scammed-jp-morgan-for-175m-but-the-bank-is-paying-her-142m-legal-bills/articleshow/125369591.cms,"How a startup deal turned into a massive fraud

A conviction that didn’t stop the bills

The controversial expenses

Why JPMorgan cannot simply stop paying

Charlie Javice’s story sounds almost too bizarre to be real: a young fintech founder who tricked JPMorgan into buying her startup for $175 million, ended up convicted of fraud, and is now serving a prison sentence, yet the same company she scammed is still paying more than $142 million for her legal bills, including questionable expenses like luxury hotel upgrades and “cellulite butter. ”Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid. When JPMorgan considered acquiring the startup in 2021, she reportedly presented the bank with millions of supposed student user accounts. Prosecutors later revealed that these numbers had been fabricated, with Javice allegedly hiring a data scientist to generate fake profiles to inflate Frank’s value.JPMorgan completed the acquisition believing Frank had more than four million users, only to discover after the deal that the platform had a tiny fraction of that. The bank alerted authorities, and by 2023 Javice was arrested on federal fraud charges.In March 2025, Javice was convicted of multiple fraud counts and sentenced to more than seven years in prison. But here’s where the story takes an unusual twist: despite defrauding the bank, she is still allowed to bill JPMorgan for her legal defence because of an indemnification clause included in the acquisition agreement.This contractual protection, which is common in startup buyouts, requires JPMorgan to cover certain legal costs for former executives of Frank.As a result, the bank has already paid over $142 million in defence expenses for Javice and her former colleague Olivier Amar.The clause itself is a standard feature in mergers, designed to protect executives from being financially ruined by lawsuits connected to their time at the company. In normal situations, it is meant to ensure fairness and prevent frivolous legal targeting after an acquisition. But in this case, it has trapped JPMorgan in a bizarre obligation: they must keep funding the defence of someone who defrauded them.Had the bank conducted even a simple, early-stage verification of Frank’s user data—such as requesting direct access to the platform’s actual customer records or running a basic audit—this entire dispute could have been avoided. Instead, delayed due diligence and overconfidence in the startup’s claims set the stage for a costly legal mess that continues years after the fraud was uncovered.JPMorgan’s frustration has grown as the legal bills have ballooned. The bank claims the expenses submitted include personal items such as cellulite butter, first-class travel upgrades, and hotel luxuries. Its lawyers argue that the billing records contain “extreme abuses,” including claims for work hours that seem physically impossible.Javice’s spokesperson denies that she personally submitted these questionable charges, stating that her legal team is responsible for all billing decisions.Even though Javice has already been convicted, she is now appealing her case, and the indemnification clause means the bank must continue paying her legal fees unless a court orders otherwise. JPMorgan is currently trying to convince a Delaware judge to halt these payments, arguing that the system is being misused.The saga has become a major lesson in the risks of fast-paced startup acquisitions. JPMorgan’s failure to properly verify Frank’s user base before buying the company has left it entangled in one of the most embarrassing and expensive due diligence failures in recent corporate history.","Charlie Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid.
