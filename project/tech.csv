In a humorous new promo for the upcoming Invictus Games, Prince Harry shared a lighthearted moment with country singer Jelly Roll , where he joked about getting a tattoo on his lower back or 'a**.' The video, shared on Instagram, shows the Duke of Sussex sitting in a tattoo chair at East Side Ink tattoo shop in New York City, awaiting his “artist.”“Is he going to be here any time soon?” Harry asked, to which a staff member assured him the tattoo artist would arrive shortly.The suspense was quickly broken when Jelly Roll, whose real name is Jason Bradley DeFord, walked in wearing black gloves and greeted the prince with enthusiasm. “Hey, hey! Tattoos. Speaking of, what’s up, man?” the country star said, adding that he was “such a fan” of Harry.Jelly Roll expressed his surprise upon learning that Prince Harry wanted him to give him his first tattoo, but Harry clarified that he wasn’t there for a tattoo. Instead, he wanted Jelly to help promote the Invictus Games, which are set to take place in Vancouver in February 2025.Harry humorously added, “There’s no tattoo in this. I can’t get a tattoo.” However, Jelly Roll insisted that if Harry allowed him to give him a tattoo, they could play a game for the Invictus Games. With that, Harry gave in, saying, “Aight, screw it. Let’s go.”When Jelly suggested getting the tattoo on Harry’s neck, the prince joked, “I was thinking like, my lower back or my a**,” adding, “That’s the place where no one’s going to see it.” The singer then went on to jokingly tattoo “I am Jelly Roll” on Harry’s neck, which caused both men to laugh before Jelly quickly exited the room.The video ended with a message announcing Jelly Roll’s performance at the Invictus Games closing ceremony on February 16, 2025.Prince Harry, who founded the Invictus Games in 2014, has worked to create an international multi-sport event for wounded, injured, and sick servicemen and women.

French plastic surgeon suspended after patients claim he left them with 'potato' noses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/french-plastic-surgeon-suspended-after-patients-complaint-he-left-them-with-potato-noses/articleshow/115609823.cms,"Olivier Gerbault (Picture credit: Gerbault Chirurgien Esthétique instagram handle)

A well-known French plastic surgeon , Olivier Gerbault , has been suspended from practicing for two years after multiple patients accused him of performing unsatisfactory nose surgeries. Gerbault , known for his ultrasonic rhinoplasty technique, allegedly left some patients with breathing difficulties and deformities.Several women who filed complaints with the medical ethics committee described their noses as resembling ""potatoes"" after the procedures, according to a New York Post report.Elisa, one of the patients, said:“My nose was long, crooked, thick, and looked like a potato. My left nostril was collapsing, and I couldn’t get any air through.”Another patient, Chloé, reported similar experiences, claiming her nose became infected and her nostrils collapsed after the surgery. She said:“I had a lump [in place of my nose], a big potato. From then on, I lost all taste for life.”Alix, another patient, alleged Gerbault inserted a chin prosthesis without her consent during her rhinoplasty.“I feel like I’ve been mutilated,"" Alix said, as quoted by New York Post. ""When I woke up, I was vomiting liters of blood. The doctor must have used a trowel. Since then, I’ve had a horrible burning sensation, air rushes in too strongly, and it gets on my nerves. Gerbault has ruined my life.”Gerbault, 58, received a two-year ban in November 2023.Despite the suspension, Gerbault continues to practice with permission from local authorities. He denies all allegations, claiming the complaints are part of a smear campaign orchestrated by a rival surgeon.“These patients are all connected and the complaints are strictly the same, sometimes down to the last word. It’s obvious they are being helped by a colleague, which is particularly serious and unprofessional,” Gerbault said, as quoted by New York Post.The surgeon is currently appealing the suspension.","Olivier Gerbault, a well-known French plastic surgeon, has been suspended from practicing for two years.

Grimes Channels Pain Into Art



Claire Grimes Boucher , widely known as Grimes, has spoken candidly about her evolving relationship with Elon Musk , the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX , with whom she shares three children. In a heartfelt post on X (formerly Twitter), the Canadian artist revealed how Musk's political transformation and personal decisions have profoundly impacted their bond, leading her to describe him as ""no longer the man I fell in love with.""Grimes (Claire Boucher) and Elon Musk met in a way that highlights their shared interests in technology and creativity.Their first interaction took place on Twitter in early 2018, when Musk was preparing to tweet a joke about artificial intelligence and a pun involving a character from 18th-century philosophy.Musk had come up with a joke about a thought experiment known as ""Roko's Basilisk,"" blending it with a pun on ""Rococo,"" an ornate art style. However, he discovered that Grimes had already made a similar joke in 2015 through her music video for ""Flesh Without Blood,"" where she referenced ""Rococo Basilisk."" Impressed by her wit and intrigued by her knowledge of esoteric topics, Musk reached out to her.The two connected over their shared fascination with futuristic ideas, artificial intelligence, and creative exploration. Their mutual appreciation for the intersection of art and technology sparked a rapport, and their online conversation soon turned into a real-life meeting. By May 2018, they made their first public appearance as a couple at the Met Gala, surprising many fans and media observers.However, their bond became strained over time due to their differing lifestyles and public scrutiny. Despite having two children together, they announced in 2021 that they were ""semi-separated.""Grimes shared her struggle in detaching from Musk, whom she once described as the love of her life. She highlighted how his shift towards conservative political ideologies, including his contentious relationship with his transgender daughter , Vivian Jenna Wilson, has made him seem ""unrecognizable"" to her. The artist has been vocal in her support for Vivian, contrasting with Musk’s alleged actions that she finds difficult to reconcile with the person she once knew.Musk's increasing alignment with right-wing politics, including his support for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, appears to have widened the gap between him and Grimes. While she has remained apolitical in public, the ideological differences seem to have strained their personal connection.In her post, Grimes hinted at significant challenges beyond their political differences. She alluded to feeling distanced from Musk’s intellectual and financial resources during their separation. She also mentioned the pain of being separated from one of their children for five months amid legal disputes. These revelations underscore the emotional toll their relationship has taken, though Grimes emphasized that some details remain private.Despite the turmoil, Grimes expressed how her personal challenges have inspired her creativity. She revealed that her upcoming artistic projects, while potentially provocative, are deeply rooted in her experiences. Grimes hopes her work will resonate with those who can relate to the complexities of love, change, and resilience.","Claire Grimes Boucher, widely known as Grimes, has spoken candidly about her evolving relationship with Elon Musk.

Here’s the truth

Truth behind the clip

Speculations around MSNBC’s future

A video of MSNBC host Rachel Maddow apparently breaking down live on air over Elon Musk ’s meme about purchasing MSNBC has gone viral. However, the clip, which depicts Maddow tearing up over Musk ’s meme, is an altered version of a broadcast from 2018.The meme Musk shared depicted a humorous scenario with a priest labelled “Elon Musk trying not to buy” and an MSNBC logo over a woman’s figure, fuelling speculation about Musk buying the network.The doctored video surfaced shortly after and claimed Maddow became emotional at the prospect of Musk purchasing MSNBC.Some users seized the moment to mock Maddow, accusing her of being overly dramatic. Comments ranged from claiming she cried because “her cash cow was ending” to suggestions that Musk would “sack her” if he acquired the network.Contrary to claims, the video is not genuine. The original footage dates back to 2018, when Maddow was reading a heartbreaking report about migrant children being separated from their parents at the US-Mexico border. The emotional moment had nothing to do with Musk or his memes.The viral meme and video emerged amidst rumours that Comcast , MSNBC’s parent company, might spin off its cable channels, including MSNBC and CNBC into a new company dubbed “SpinCo.” Musk’s meme playfully hinted at buying MSNBC, which some critics interpreted as a jab at the network’s declining ratings and future uncertainty.Although Musk joked about buying the platform, much like he did before purchasing Twitter (now X), there has been no formal confirmation of such plans.Adding to the buzz, podcaster Joe Rogan jokingly offered to take Rachel Maddow's job if Musk purchased MSNBC, promising to wear her signature glasses and outfit while ""telling the same lies.""Musk humorously replied with “Deal.”Similarly, Donald Trump Jr. teased Musk on X, suggesting he buy MSNBC, to which Musk playfully responded, “How much does it cost?”","A video of MSNBC host Rachel Maddow apparently breaking down live on air over Elon Musk’s meme about purchasing MSNBC has gone viral.

Your credit history influences your CIBIL score , which is calculated using a special method.Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Apple TV set-top-box launch and upcoming smart displays

Apple, before launching the Apple TV app and Apple TV set-top box, explored a full-fledged television set with touchscreen capabilities, a report has said. The prototypes of these devices were ready even as Steve Jobs , before his passing, claimed to have solved the puzzle of creating an Apple television . However, this vision never materialised.According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, before his death in 2011, the Apple co-founder told biographer Walter Isaacson that he’d “finally cracked it”, referring to large-display prototypes that could also serve as a touchscreen Mac or iPad.The product would sync with other devices and the iCloud service, Jobs said, and “have the simplest user interface you could imagine.”Gurman said that despite these advancements, Apple ultimately shelved the project for two reasons. One was the low-profit margins, and the other being high production and shipping costs.Gurman said that Apple’s analysis of the TV market as a business suggested that TVs provide low margins and consumers usually don’t buy new ones very frequently like the way they upgrade to iPhones or Mac PCs.“The effort never got as far as the Apple Watch or Vision Pro — or even the now-defunct self-driving car. TVs are a low-margin industry, and consumers don’t buy new ones very frequently. At the time, Apple was highly dependent on people upgrading iPhones, iPads and Macs as often as possible (that remains true today, but the company at least has a healthier services business). A low-margin device without a path to upgrades would have been a mistake,” Gurman added.High manufacturing costs also proved to be a deal-breaker. The total cost of shipping TV-like devices from factories to people's homes was also a concern.“Apple also immediately encountered cost concerns, including the expense of air-shipping gigantic panels from factories to warehouses to homes. The company would have needed to develop and produce new chips to power the displays, as well as the input-output electronics. And the project would have required manufacturing facilities for the high-quality screens and adequate supplies of glass,” Gurman added.However, this didn’t impact Apple’s aspirations to reach people’s TVs. Apple now offers Apple TV box for streaming and Apple TV+ app that has a selection of successful content.Gurman has also said that Apple is actively developing various smart home devices, including a wall-mounted smart screen “that users can stick in their kitchens for videoconferencing and looking up recipes.”Notably, Amazon recently launched a 21-inch smart display and gave Echo Show 15 an upgrade. In comparison, Apple’s version is said to be about the size of two iPhones side by side, putting the overall screen size below 7 inches.","Report: Apple explored a full-fledged television set with touchscreen capabilities.

Employee monitoring software has gone off the deep end with AI

Had the pleasure of sitting through a sales pitch for a pretty big ""productivity monitoring"" software suite this morning. Here's the expected basics of what this application does:

Full keylogging and mouse movement tracking (this has been around for ages)



Takes a screenshot of your desktop every interval (between 10 seconds to 5 minutes), also part of every RMM I know



Keeps track of the programs you open and how often, also standard



Creates real-time recordings and heat maps of where you click in any program (nearly all websites also do this)



Here's where it gets fun:

It allows your manager to group you into a ""work category"" along with your coworkers



It then uses ""AI"" to create a ""productivity graph"" from all your mouse movement data, where you click, how fast you type, how often you use backspace, the sites you visit, the programs you open, how many emails you send and compares all of this to your coworker's data in the same ""work category""



If you fall below a cutoff percentage (say you type slower than your colleague or take longer to fill out a form or have to answer a phone call in the middle of writing an email), you get a red flag for review that gets sent to your manager and whoever else they choose



You can then be prompted to ""justify"" this gap in productivity in their web portal



If your desktop is idle for more than 30-60 seconds (no ""meaningful"" mouse & keyboard movement), you get a red flag



If your workflow is consistent Monday - Thursday but falls below the set aggregate data score on a Friday, you get a red flag



It also claims it can use all of this gathered data for ""workflow efficiency automation"" (e.g. replacing you). The same company that sells this suite conveniently also sells AI automation services, and since they already have all your employee workflow data, why not give them more money while you're at it?



While this is all probably old news for everyone here, I for one can't wait until the internet as a whole collapses in on itself so we can finally be free of this endless race to the bottom.

A viral Reddit post has sparked outrage about the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) to monitor employee activity.

Samsung One UI 7 may be released soon. While other brands are rolling out stable Android 15 updates , Samsung has yet to release the first beta of its One UI 7, marking a surprising slowdown for a company known for its rapid updates in recent years. According to reports, this delay might be due to Samsung focusing on perfecting One UI 7. According to a new leak, the company may begin rolling out the One UI 7 as early as next month.Here’s a look at the expected timeline and features of Samsung One UI 7As per the leak, Samsung may begin the beta rollout of OneUI 7 in the first week of December. The tipster claims that Samsung may launch the Galaxy S24 with the latest UI version next year. (Here’s when Samsung may launch the Galaxy S24 series). According to the leakster, the beta program could be two months long.The Samsung Galaxy S23 series is expected to receive the One UI 6 update roughly three weeks after the beta rollout. For Galaxy S22 users, the beta update may arrive next year, while the Galaxy S21 series is unlikely to participate in the beta program at all.Earlier this year, tipster Ice Universe shared a video showcasing the updated animations and redesigned Quick Panel in Samsung's One UI 7. The video revealed a notable change in Samsung's design approach, with notifications now separated from quick settings in the dropdown menu.The revamped Quick Panel may adopt a bubble-shaped icon design, reminiscent of iOS. At the top, two larger bubbles may be present to offer quick access to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, while smaller icons for features like airplane mode, location, and flashlight are expected to be neatly arranged within a rounded rectangle. Additionally, the video suggested that users will likely have the ability to customise the panel by adding or removing controls to suit their preferences.","According to a new leak, the company may begin rolling out the One UI 7 as early as next month.

A Tribute to Marshawn Lynch



NFL Fines Jameson Williams and Patrick Mahomes for Controversial Celebrations

NFL's Quick Reaction



Reactions and Impact



Detroit Lions wide receiver Jameson Williams was fined $19,697 by the NFL for ""Unsportsmanlike Conduct (obscene gestures)"" after his touchdown celebration during his team's most recent game versus the Jacksonville Jaguars. Williams executed a backward dive into the end zone, mimicking a famous move from Seattle Seahawks legend Marshawn Lynch. The move, which also included a groin grab, brought lots of attention and controversy, comparing it to Lynch's infamous jump that happened after his famous ""BeastQuake"" run of the 2011 NFC wild card game.The odd dive was no spontaneous act of joy.Williams would later say he wanted to pay tribute to Marshawn Lynch, one of his football idols. Lynch's dance following his 67-yard touchdown run, in which he did essentially the same thing, had become synonymous with his career and an iconic moment of history in the NFL. By doing the same gesture himself, Williams paid respect to the legendary Seahawks player, who is particularly known for being tough and having a great personality.The league, though it did not plan this instance for the celebration, soon imposed the fine upon Williams for his actions as it cited obscene gestures on the field. The league is a tight-knit system with respect to unsportsmanlike conduct, especially as far as gestures are concerned, which other people might perceive as offensive or improper. Actually, the NFL encourages players to celebrate touchdowns; it keeps a watch over such celebrations from becoming offense or disrespect.Also Read - Sauce Gardner’s Social Media Slip-Up: A Leaked DM and a Public Apology The fine by the NFL has sparked an intense debate between fans and analysts on the social media platform. On one end, people are saying what Williams did to admire the football icon was harmless. On the other side, it is considered to be wrong behaviour while playing the game.Whether or not this fine will have the desired deterrent effect to prevent other players from attempting like celebrations in the future is anyone's guess, but it is clear that the league wants to be clear about its standards of conduct.","Detroit Lions wide receiver Jameson Williams was fined $19,697 by the NFL for ""Unsportsmanlike Conduct (obscene gestures)"" Williams executed a backward dive into the end zone, mimicking a famous move from Seattle Seahawks legend Marshawn Lynch.
