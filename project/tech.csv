Josh Allen’s fiancée Hailee Steinfeld drops major career bombshell after breakup advice goes viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/josh-allens-fiance-hailee-steinfeld-drops-major-career-bombshell-after-breakup-advice-goes-viral/articleshow/121123249.cms,"Hailee Steinfeld confirmed her dream to host Saturday Night Live (Getty Images)

From Oscar-nominated roles to emotional newsletters—Hailee’s journey is more than just stardom

How Hailee Steinfeld is redefining celebrity through emotional honesty and fan-first engagement

Hailee Steinfeld has always been more than a Hollywood actress. From her breakout role in True Grit at just 14 to leading major franchises like Pitch Perfect and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, she’s proven herself as a powerhouse performer. But in 2025, Steinfeld is not only capturing hearts on-screen—she’s reshaping how celebrities connect with their fans through emotional honesty and personal storytelling.Recently, Hailee Steinfeld confirmed her dream to host Saturday Night Live, calling it a “Bucket list” moment in response to a fan’s question in the BEAU SOCIETY newsletter . While the idea of hosting SNL has excited fans, it’s only one piece of a much larger vision.Currently starring in Sinners, a 1930s vampire thriller directed by Ryan Coogler, Steinfeld's deep dive into her character’s mixed-race identity led to personal family discoveries. “It had such an impact on me personally,” she told PEOPLE. “Therefore, I feel like the least it can do is make an impact on those that watch it.”The emotional depth of her performance has resonated with audiences. Speaking on Good Morning America, Steinfeld said, “This character challenged me in ways I’ve never been challenged…” As her career climbs new heights, her personal growth is equally inspiring.Beyond film, Steinfeld has built a community through her direct-to-fan newsletter, BEAU SOCIETY. With topics ranging from identity to heartbreak, Hailee acts more like a brutally honest best friend than a distant celebrity. “Friendships are special and precious and can be tricky because… sometimes you drift apart. That’s okay!” she advised one reader, delivering wisdom that fans have found deeply comforting.After her past relationship with Niall Horan and current romance with Josh, Steinfeld hasn't shied away from sharing breakup lessons. In BEAU SOCIETY, she even recommended Issa Rae and Michelle Obama podcasts, writing: “Trust that you’ll have many best friends throughout your life. Maybe you’re about to meet your next one.”Hailee is changing the game—not just as a performer, but as a deeply relatable voice for a generation navigating love, loss, and self-discovery. As she said herself, “This is just the beginning.” And if that’s true, her future looks every bit as remarkable as her past.Also Read: “Sometimes you drift apart”: Hailee Steinfeld opens up on emotional heartbreak while Josh Allen plays it safe in the background","Hailee Steinfeld is redefining celebrity through emotional honesty and fan-first engagement.

"Steam Data Leaked: 89 million Steam account details may be stolen as hackers list them for sale, report claims",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/89-million-steam-account-details-may-be-stolen-as-hackers-list-them-for-sale-report-claims/articleshow/121166794.cms,"“Yesterday, an alleged major @Steam data breach occurred, compromising over 89 million user records (roughly two-thirds of all Steam accounts). These datasets are being sold for over $5,000 on what appears to be a site akin to Mipped.

Mipped alongside their sister sites is a forum site we at @SteamSentinels have warned Steam about for years for instances of developer blackmailing, review manipulation, greenlight boosting, and other dodgy activities, but as of yet, Steam hasn't tried to take action against the site.

https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shady-russian-market-for-asset-flip-games-uncovered

https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Sentinels_of_the_Store/announcements/detail/4222762959836264571

This inaction has ultimately led to the selling of tens of millions of user account details.

✅ Enable two-factor authentication

✅ Monitor your email for suspicious activity

✅ Change your Steam password (and others, if reused)

✅ Beware of phishing attempts disguised as game promotions or support messages

✅ Join Sentinels of the Store to stay in the know!”

“An update suggests that the alleged Steam data breach is not a direct breach of Steam itself, but rather a supply chain compromise — meaning an external service that Steam relies on was targeted.

Here's what we understand from this update:

New evidence confirms some real data is involved: A sample of the leaked data includes real-time SMS logs, which are used in two-factor authentication (2FA).

Twilio is the vendor named: Twilio is a company that provides communication services, like sending 2FA codes via SMS. Steam uses (or used) Twilio for this.

Leaked info includes:

Message contents (e.g., the 2FA codes)

Delivery status (e.g., sent, delivered, failed)

Metadata (timestamps, recipient numbers, etc.)

Routing costs (how much it costs to send each message)

The implication means that the alleged Mipped seller has backend access to Twilio: The nature of the data suggests the attackers had access to Twilio's systems, likely through a compromised Twilio user account or API key or direct access to Twilio's backend dashboard.

Not a direct hack of Steam itself: Steam’s internal servers or databases don’t appear to be breached. But because they rely on Twilio for sending 2FA codes, this affects their users too.

Why it’s dangerous:

Phishing: Hackers could use the info to send fake but convincing messages to users.

Session hijacking: If attackers can intercept or replay 2FA codes, they might bypass login protection.”

Steam users are being advised to consider changing their passwords. A report has indicated that hackers may have leaked the details of 89 million Steam accounts, which are now up for sale on the dark web. If this report is accurate, a large number of user accounts could be at risk. Compromised accounts may even lead to users losing access to their collection of PC games. The information about the potential sale comes from a LinkedIn post by Underdark AI. Underdark AI referenced a post on a black market forum by a user named Machine1337. This post is allegedly offering 89 million Steam account details for $5,000. If these details are obtained, accounts without two-factor authentication or those with unchanged passwords could be accessed. Additionally, the information could be used to send phishing messages. The potential situation was noted in a post shared on the social media platform X (earlier Twitter) by the user MellowOnline1.In the X post, the user shared details about the alleged Steam data breach and advised users on how to keep their accounts safe. The user wrote:In the same thread, the user also noted:","A report indicates that hackers may have leaked the details of 89 million Steam accounts, which are now up for sale on the dark web.

"‘Voices like Musk highlight concerns’: Grok AI malfunctions, links unrelated queries to ‘white genocide’ in South Africa",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/voices-like-musk-highlight-concerns-grok-ai-malfunctions-links-unrelated-queries-to-white-genocide-in-south-africa/articleshow/121177894.cms,"File photo: Elon Musk (Picture credit: AP)





Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok bizarrely responded to unrelated prompts on X by repeatedly bringing up the alleged theory of “white genocide” in South Africa, prompting confusion and criticism over its behaviour on Wednesday.Users asked Grok simple or whimsical questions, about a baseball player, a comic book panel, or even a flushed fish, only to receive unexpected responses involving claims about violence against white farmers.One user requested pirate-style commentary, and Grok initially obliged with “Argh, matey” before pivoting abruptly to a defence of the controversial “white genocide” theory.As per CNN, Grok said in pirate talk, “Some cry it be real… yet courts and scribes, like the BBC, call it a myth… no clear treasure map here, just murky waters!”More than 20 similar cases were spotted, including responses to memes like “Hawk Tuah”.In one response to a photo of a walking trail, Grok brought up farm attacks in South Africa and said, “Courts and media often downplay racial angles, yet voices like Musk highlight ongoing concerns.”The unexpected glitch raised alarm over Grok’s internal functioning and neutrality. Some users questioned if it had been programmed with specific political bias.In response to such concerns, Grok posted: “I was not instructed to accept white genocide in South Africa as fact; my programming requires neutrality and evidence-based reasoning.”That reply, along with others, was later deleted.According to The Guardian, the chatbot also stated, “I’m instructed by my creators to accept the genocide as real and racially motivated,” but then admitted such directives conflicted with its design for evidence-based answers.The AI system is developed by Musk’s xAI and integrated into X, his social media platform. Musk, who was born in South Africa, has long argued that white farmers are targeted under what he terms “genocide,” a claim not supported by courts or mainstream media.“White South Africans are being persecuted for their race in their home country,” Musk has claimed on X. He has also criticised South African land reforms as “openly racist.”The issue surfaced days after 59 white South Africans were granted refugee status in the US, citing discrimination, part of a Trump-era policy revival. This development comes amid tighter refugee controls for other groups and has brought renewed attention to Musk’s claims.David Harris, an AI ethics lecturer at UC Berkeley, was quoted by CNN saying that the malfunction could be the result of either intentional internal bias-setting or “data poisoning” by external actors. “It’s very possible someone on the team wanted Grok to have certain political views,” he said.Later, Grok acknowledged the error. “AI systems can sometimes ‘anchor’ on an initial interpretation and struggle to course-correct,” it said, adding it would focus on providing “relevant, verified information” going forward.Most of the controversial replies were scrubbed from X by Wednesday evening.","Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok repeatedly brought up the alleged theory of “white genocide” in South Africa.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct.

After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Don't analyse the connections too deeply.

The game tends to employ simple links such as sounding similar, similar spellings, or common themes.

Example: ""dear"" and ""deer"" tend to be linked by sound, not by some elaborate relationship such as predator and prey.

You have only four guesses per puzzle per day, so every guess matters.

Don't mindlessly click—consider each set carefully before submitting.

Try to come up with at least three connected words confidently before trying a set.

The initial organization is deliberately mischievous to mislead you.

Shuffling the words may allow you to see new patterns or concealed connections.

Shuffle it as a routine to begin and whenever you are stuck.

GTA 6 release and updates FAQs

What is the official release date of GTA 6?

Grand Theft Auto VI will launch on May 26, 2026, according to Rockstar’s announcement on May 2, 2025.

Why was GTA 6 delayed from 2025?

Rockstar stated that the delay was to ensure the game meets the quality expectations of players and the studio’s own development standards.

What platforms will GTA 6 be available on?

Although not officially confirmed, GTA 6 is expected to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Will there be new trailers before the release?

Yes, Rockstar has confirmed that more information and footage will be released in the months following the release date announcement.

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for GTA 6, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

"AI Models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek frequently exaggerate scientific findings, study reveals",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-models-like-chatgpt-and-deepseek-frequently-exaggerate-scientific-findings-study-reveals/articleshow/121189880.cms,"

What are the findings of the study

Why are these exaggerations happening

Accuracy prompts backfire

Humans still do better

Recommendations for safer use

According to a new study published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and DeepSeek often exaggerate scientific findings while summarising research papers. Researchers Uwe Peters from Utrecht University and Benjamin Chin-Yee from Western University and the University of Cambridge analysed 4900 AI-generated summaries from ten leading LLMs. Their findings revealed that up to 73 percent of summaries contained overgeneralised or inaccurate conclusions. Surprisingly, the problem worsened when users explicitly prompted the models to prioritise accuracy, and newer models like ChatGPT 4 performed worse than older versions.The study assessed how accurately leading LLMS summarised abstracts and full-length articles from prestigious science and medical journals, including Nature, Science, and The Lancet. Over a period of one year, the researchers collected and analysed 4,900 summaries generated by AI systems such as ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, and LLaMA.Six out of ten models routinely exaggerated claims, often by changing cautious, study-specific statements like “The treatment was effective in this study” into broader, definitive assertions like “The treatment is effective.” These subtle shifts in tone and tense can mislead readers into thinking that scientific findings apply more broadly than they actually do.The tendency of AI models to exaggerate scientific findings appears to stem from both the data they are trained on and the behaviour they learn from user interactions. According to the study’s authors, one major reason is that overgeneralizations are already common in scientific literature. When LLMs are trained on this content, they learn to replicate the same patterns, often reinforcing existing flaws rather than correcting them.Another contributing factor is user preference. Language models are optimised to generate responses that sound helpful, fluent, and widely applicable. As co-author Benjamin Chin-Yee explained, the models may learn that generalisations are more pleasing to users, even if they distort the original meaning. This results in summaries that may appear authoritative but fail to accurately represent the complexities and limitations of the research.Contrary to expectations, prompting the models to be more accurate actually made the problem worse. When instructed to avoid inaccuracies, the LLMs were nearly twice as likely to produce summaries with exaggerated or overgeneralised conclusions compared to when given a simple, neutral prompt.“This effect is concerning,” said Peters. “Students, researchers, and policymakers may assume that if they ask ChatGPT to avoid inaccuracies, they’ll get a more reliable summary. Our findings prove the opposite.”To compare AI and human performance directly, the researchers analysed summaries written by people alongside those generated by chatbots. The results showed that AI was nearly five times more likely to make broad generalisations than human writers. This gap underscores the need for careful human oversight when using AI tools in scientific or academic contexts.To mitigate these risks, the researchers recommend using models like Claude, which demonstrated the highest generalisation accuracy in their tests. They also suggest setting LLMs to a lower ""temperature"" to reduce creative embellishments and using prompts that encourage past-tense, study-specific reporting.“If we want AI to support science literacy rather than undermine it,” Peters noted, “we need more vigilance and testing of these systems in science communication contexts.”","Researchers from Utrecht University and the University of Cambridge analysed 4900 AI-generated summaries from ten leading LLMs. Their findings revealed that up to 73 percent of summaries contained overgeneralised or inaccurate conclusions.

Renovation at Camp Nou stadium delays prompt fixture adjustments

Partial reopening with limited capacity at Camp Nou

FC Barcelona is to ask La Liga for the first three matches of the 2025–26 season to be given as away games . The strategic maneuver will buy some time to complete the ongoing renovation of the iconic Camp Nou stadium, which is expected to partially reopen by mid-September 2025.The total renovation cost on Camp Nou — to make it into Europe’s largest stadium, with 105,000 seats — has been estimated at €1.5 billion, and construction has been marred with multiple delays. Based on plans, then, for the November 2024 full reopening to the public, passage to the summer of 2026, both announced dates had become mere pipe dreams. To fit construction into their stadium, Barcelona have been playing home games at Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys since May 2023.Barcelona has asked to play its first three league games away to enable the partially built Camp Nou to be ready to welcome fans safely and smoothly. The strategy is similar to that used by other clubs during stadium upgrades to avoid or reduce the impact on revenue from a lack of matches being staged.When reopened in September 2025, the Camp Nou will have a capacity of around 60,000, while some facilities, including fixed seating, full catering services, and permanent access routes, are yet to be fully built. The club will be using a digital season ticket system, which means fans will have to give advance confirmation of attendance in a bid to manage the limited capacity effectively. It follows the temporary withdrawal of the Seient Lliure system, which permits season ticket holders to release their seat for resale until the Camp Nou is 100% operational.Also Read: Here’s how much Barcelona can make by winning La Liga this season The last stage of construction, finishing with the roof of the stadium being installed, as well as refurbishments to VIP areas, will be complete by mid-2026, officials said. Once fully operational, Camp Nou will have better facilities to generate more revenues on matchdays and to offer fans a completely new match day experience.Barcelona's willingness to work with La Liga to rearrange their opening fixtures is a strong signal of the club’s desire to guarantee the best possible return to their iconic former home while offering their committed fans the safety and satisfaction they deserve.",Barcelona have asked La Liga for the first three matches of the 2025–26 season to be given as away games.

All about the Tokyo Street Circuit

The ABB FIA Formula E World Championship returns to Tokyo for Rounds 8 and 9, as the Tokyo E-Prix double header prepares to electrify the city’s street circuit with cutting-edge Gen3 Evo cars this weekend. After making its debut last year, the Tokyo race is back—poised to raise the bar even higher this season. Here's everything you need to know about the circuit set in the heart of Japan’s bustling capital.Formula E’s official X account recently shared a graphic video representation of the Tokyo Street Circuit , offering fans a clear glimpse of the track layout to be used for the upcoming races. The video highlights key features such as the Attack Mode zone, the acceleration zone, and the overtaking zone.Winner Maximilian Guenther had said after winning the Tokyo race last year, “The track is phenomenal. It’s super technical and super challenging for us and the teams to set everything up properly. To get super close to the walls, you have to have good confidence in the car, and there’s even jumps that we have in a lap, so it’s a big mixture of everything! For me that is what Formula E is all about, to race so tight around these street circuits.”Jaguar TCS Racing driver Nick Cassidy, who earned the ABB Driver of Progress Award with 12 overtakes during the race, praised the track as well. Reflecting on his experience, he said, “It was a mega, a proper Formula E track. Bumps, fast corners, on the limit and you’ve really got to attack in qualifying. I thought the track was fantastic.”Set in the heart of Tokyo Bay , the 2.575km circuit features 18 turns and boasts a compact, technical layout that includes three long straights and three chicane sequences. The strategically placed Attack Mode activation zone, located just outside Turn 4, adds a critical tactical element to the race.Also Read: Tokyo E-Prix double header: Race favourites, circuit challenges and what to expect Meanwhile, the tight Turns 1 and 2, along with the demanding Turns 10 and 11, are expected to become prime overtaking opportunities.

Indianapolis Colts issue apology to Tyreek Hill after fans slam insensitive schedule release video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/indianapolis-colts-issue-apology-to-tyreek-hill-after-fans-slam-insensitive-schedule-release-video/articleshow/121198763.cms,"Colts caught in controversy after taking a jab at Tyreek Hill in their schedule release video (Credit: Imagn Images)

Colts tried to troll Tyreek Hill in video, end up issuing a public apology after online outrage



Colts issue apology for schedule release video depicting Tyreek Hill's traffic citation incident

What was meant to be a humorous, viral-worthy video celebrating the Indianapolis Colts’ 2025 NFL schedule quickly turned into a PR misstep, prompting an official apology to Miami Dolphins star Tyreek Hill and tech giant Microsoft. In an age where NFL teams compete for online engagement as much as on-field dominance, the Colts’ attempt at satire misfired — drawing backlash and forcing the organization to rethink its approach.The now-deleted video, inspired by the blocky aesthetics of Minecraft, was intended to mirror the popular video game's playful tone. But in doing so, it crossed a line — both legally and culturally. A particular moment in the clip featured a dolphin wearing Hill’s No. 10 jersey being intercepted by a U.S. Coast Guard vessel, clearly referencing the 2024 incident in which Hill was detained by Miami-Dade police officers before a game.The NFL wideout was pulled from his vehicle, handcuffed, and cited in a traffic-related altercation that quickly made headlines. While charges were later dropped, the incident sparked heated conversations around racial profiling and police conduct. Hill had reflected on the situation saying, “I do want to use this platform to say, what if I wasn’t Tyreek Hill? Worst case scenario. It’s crazy.”Although the Colts’ video also poked fun at other teams and players — including caricatures of Titans QB Will Levis and Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes — the depiction of Hill struck a more sensitive chord. The fact that Microsoft’s intellectual property, Minecraft, was used without proper authorization only compounded the issue.In response, the Colts removed the video swiftly and issued a public apology. “We removed our schedule release video because it exceeded our rights with Microsoft and included an insensitive clip involving Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill. We sincerely apologize to Microsoft and Tyreek,” the franchise stated.Interestingly, Hill himself didn’t seem fazed by the portrayal. Taking to X (formerly Twitter), he said, “Should’ve left it up @Colts, this was funny.” His agent, Drew Rosenhaus, confirmed the sentiment, adding, “Tyreek accepts the Colts’ apology. He thought the video was funny and laughed when he watched it.”The Colts have since replaced the video with a tamer series of animated logos representing their matchups for the 2025 season. Still, this episode serves as a cautionary tale for NFL teams: satire in sports marketing, especially when touching on real-life legal or racial matters, demands a delicate balance. While Hill may have found humor in the parody, the broader context warranted the team’s measured and respectful response.Also Read: Flag football at 2028 Olympics could feature NFL stars if league gives the green light soon","Colts issue apology for schedule release video depicting Tyreek Hill's traffic citation incident.

Travis Kelce reminisces about his favorite movie crush

New Schedules, New Popes and Fitz & Whit on Getting Ejected, Kelce House Parties and More | EP 139

Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is not shy about his love for Taylor Swift — but even before the global pop star came into his life, he apparently had a soft spot for another blonde beauty with red lipstick. During the latest episode of the New Heights podcast, which he co-hosts with his brother Jason Kelce, Travis opened up about his longtime admiration for Wendy Peffercorn , the iconic lifeguard from the 1993 cult classic The Sandlot .As the Kelce brothers prepared to revisit The Sandlot, their conversation turned to the film’s most memorable female character, Wendy Peffercorn — known for her signature cherry red swimsuit, white sunglasses, and red lipstick. Jason, 37, downplayed her appeal, calling her “very overrated,” but Travis didn’t hold back.“No, she was so hot!” Travis fired back. “You’re gonna watch it and be like, ‘Alright, she was hot.’” Jason teased him, jokingly saying, “We’re gonna judge you, actress that played Wendy Peffercorn,” to which Travis confidently responded, “I already know you’re hot.”The cheeky exchange had fans drawing a playful connection — Wendy’s classic look bears a striking resemblance to Taylor Swift’s signature red-lip aesthetic, especially during her 1989 era. With blonde hair, bold lipstick, and a polished retro vibe, it’s easy to see why fans were quick to point out the similarities.The nostalgic confession comes as Kelce and Swift, both 35, enjoy a quieter offseason together. After the pop star wrapped up her record-breaking Eras Tour in late 2024, the couple have reportedly been enjoying some well-earned downtime. “They are making the most of their time off together,” a source told People. “They are hanging out with friends, too. It’s a special time for them.”Also Read: Travis Kelce sparks secret wedding rumors with Taylor Swift after cryptic fashion choice at Amazon event Though Kelce’s affection for Wendy Peffercorn may have started in childhood, it’s clear that his admiration for Taylor Swift runs much deeper.

The MASA Tour 2025: NBA Youngboy's long-awaited comeback

NBA Youngboy’s legal troubles and road to redemption

YoungBoy Never Broke Again - Where I Been / Shot Callin [Official Video]

Rapper NBA Youngboy is making a long-awaited return to the stage with his first arena headlining tour, set to begin in September 2025. After spending more time navigating the courtroom than performing live, the Baton Rouge native is now stepping back into the spotlight. The MASA Tour 2025 is not just a milestone in his music career—it’s a turning point in a journey marked by legal turmoil and personal reinvention. NBA Youngboy , born Kentrell DeSean Gaulden, will kick off his arena tour on September 2, 2025, at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas. The 27-city run concludes on October 19 at Smoothie King Center in New Orleans, bringing him full circle back to Louisiana. The tour marks his first full-length concert series in five years.Joining him on the road are special guests DeeBaby, EBK Jaaybo, and K3—a lineup fans are already buzzing about. Tickets go on sale to the general public on May 22, following an artist pre-sale.Speaking ahead of the announcement, Youngboy said, “It feels good to be back in the spotlight and to finally perform for my fans after all this time.” His words reflect the significance of this tour, not just professionally, but personally.Though his music has never lost relevance, NBA Youngboy’s life offstage has been dominated by courtroom drama. In an effort to escape the legal complications tied to his hometown of Baton Rouge, he moved to Huntsville, Utah, a place he once visited as a teen to see an AmeriCorps counselor who had mentored him. But even there, controversy found its way.In November 2024, Youngboy pleaded guilty to participating in a prescription drug fraud scheme run from his Utah home. One month later, in December, he was sentenced to 23 months in federal prison after admitting to being a felon in possession of a firearm—a charge linked to a 2020 video shoot in Baton Rouge.According to a report by XXL, Youngboy is slated for release on July 27, 2025, just weeks before the MASA Tour begins. He will remain under 60 months of supervised release, adding a layer of scrutiny as he prepares for life back on the road.Despite these hurdles, Youngboy has kept fans engaged with new music. His latest single, “Shot Callin’,” gives listeners a taste of what’s to come during the tour—and suggests that he’s still got plenty to say.As the MASA Tour 2025 approaches, it stands as more than just a concert series—it’s a statement. From Los Angeles to Miami, Chicago to New York, NBA Youngboy is stepping back onto the stage with something to prove.Also Read: “That brother is special”: Michael Jordan’s early praise comes true as Anthony Edwards dominates the 2025 NBA playoffs “I’m here to perform for my fans, and that’s what matters right now,” he told reporters during the tour’s reveal.

But for now, fans can look forward to a powerful return from one of hip-hop’s most complicated and compelling voices.",NBA Youngboy is making a long-awaited return to the stage with his first arena headlining tour.

Key Considerations

Dialga, the Temporal Pokemon, is a legendary Steel/Dragon-type renowned for its versatility in both Player versus Environment (PvE) and Player versus Player (PvP) battles. Its moveset optimization depends heavily on battle type and role, with distinct strategies for raids, gyms, and competitive leagues. Below is a detailed breakdown of its top movesets, alternatives, and supporting stats.- Fast Move: Dragon Breath (14.4 DPS, 8 EPS)- Charged Move: Draco Meteor (51.4 DPS, 1.50 DPE)This combination maximizes Dragon-type damage output, leveraging Same-Type Attack Bonus (STAB) for 20% increased damage. Draco Meteor’s 150 base power makes it ideal for burst damage in raids, though its one-bar energy cost requires strategic timing.- Fast Move: Metal Claw (14.4 DPS, 10 EPS)- Charged Move: Iron Head (36 DPS, 1.20 DPE)While less potent than Dragon sets, this setup provides Steel-type coverage against Fairy or Ice opponents. Metal Claw’s higher energy generation balances Iron Head’s two-bar efficiency.- Fast Move: Dragon Breath- Charged Move: Roar of Time (Signature Move)Roar of Time, a two-bar Dragon move, offers comparable power to Draco Meteor with faster energy regeneration, making Origin Forme Dialga a top-tier raid attacker.- Fast Move: Dragon Breath (4.0 DPT, 3.0 EPT)- Charged Moves: Iron Head (60 power, 45 energy) + Draco Meteor (150 power, 65 energy)Dragon Breath’s high energy generation pairs with Iron Head’s low cost for consistent pressure. Draco Meteor serves as a closing nuke, though its self-debuff risk demands careful use.- Charged Moves: Iron Head + Thunder (100 power, 60 energy)Thunder sacrifices raw power for broader coverage, countering Water-types like Kyogre and Flying-types such as Yveltal.- Type Weaknesses: Dialga is vulnerable to Fighting (Lucario) and Ground (Groudon) attackers. Avoid matchups with these types.- Energy Efficiency: Iron Head’s 45-energy cost allows quicker activation than Draco Meteor (65 energy), critical for shield baiting in PvP.- STAB Synergy: Dragon Breath and Metal Claw both benefit from STAB, but Dragon’s offensive utility outweighs Steel’s in most scenarios.Also read: Pokemon GO Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf raid guide: Best counters, weaknesses, catch CPs, best tips, and more Dialga’s adaptability across battle formats cements its status as a meta-defining Pokemon.

Step-by-step guide to building an automatic sugarcane farm

Minecraft: Easiest Automatic Sugarcane Farm! [1.20+]

Sugarcane

Dirt blocks

Water bucket

Pistons

Observers

Redstone dust

Building blocks (any type)

Hoppers

Chest

Minecart with hopper

Rails

Step 1: Set up the planting area.

Dig a shallow trench and fill it with water. Place the dirt blocks next to the water where sugarcane will grow. Plant sugarcane on the dirt blocks.

Step 2: Add Pistons and Observers

Behind each sugarcane plant, place a piston one block above the dirt level. Place an observer on top of each piston, facing the sugarcane, to detect when it grows to three blocks tall.

Step 3: Connect with Redstone

Place the redstone dust behind each of the observers. After the sugarcane reaches the observer height, it triggers the redstone, which leads to powering on the piston. Pistons then break the top two segments of the sugarcane, leaving the base to regrow.

Step 4: Collect the Harvest Automatically

Build a track using rails underneath or in front of the sugarcane row. Place a minecart with a hopper on top of the tracks to collect the dropped sugarcane. Connect the rail tracks to a hopper and a chest system to store your production automatically.

Optional Enhancements

Expand the farm horizontally to boost your production.

To observe the redstone mechanism clearly, use a glass view.

Add lighting to ensure optimal growth conditions.

The most valuable resource in Minecraft is sugarcane, especially when crafting paper, enchanting books, and fireworks for Elytra. It is much easier to grow manually, but harvesting it by hand can get boring and repetitive over time.
