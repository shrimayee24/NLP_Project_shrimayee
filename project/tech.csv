Kirk Cousins could end Aaron Rodgers' comeback dreams as Steelers move fast to replace their QB gap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/kirk-cousins-could-end-aaron-rodgers-comeback-dreams-as-steelers-move-fast-to-replace-their-qb-gap/articleshow/120749044.cms,"Kirk Cousins could cut Aaron Rodgers down the line and take the job in Pittsburgh (Getty Images)

With Aaron Rodgers undecided, Kirk Cousins emerges as top alternative

The Pittsburgh Steelers are currently facing a pivotal moment in their quarterback strategy, with two high-profile names in the spotlight Aaron Rodgers and Kirk Cousins. The team has reportedly offered Rodgers a one-year deal worth $10 million in hopes of bringing his leadership and experience to Pittsburgh. However, Rodgers, now nearing the twilight of his career, has yet to make a firm decision, potentially weighing retirement or a more favorable opportunity.Aaron Rodgers’ indecision has led the Steelers to look at backup options, and Kirk Cousins has emerged as a serious contender. Cousins, who signed a massive four-year, $180 million contract with the Atlanta Falcons, recently found himself unexpectedly sidelined. The Falcons chose to start rookie quarterback Michael Penix Jr., leaving Cousins' future with the team in doubt. Frustrated by the move, Cousins is now open to joining another team where he can continue as a starter, and the Steelers may offer that chance.Just days ahead of the 2025 NFL Draft, reports from The Athletic’s Dianna Russini suggest that a potential three-team trade is gaining momentum between the Browns, Steelers, and Vikings one that could include veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins. With Cousins openly expressing his desire to move on from the Falcons, Pittsburgh is shaping up to be the most appealing landing spot for him.""It's believed that Cousins would be against any trade that involves sending him to a situation involving a young QB, similar to the situation he faced in Atlanta last year,"" Russini stated, alluding to the entry of rookie Michael Penix Jr., who overtook Cousins for the starting role during the 2024 campaign.Despite his availability, Kirk Cousins brings both promise and concern. On the one hand, he offers veteran experience and consistent performance in the regular season. On the other hand, he has a reputation for struggling under pressure, particularly in high-stakes games, and he posted a high number of interceptions in his last season. For the Steelers, who prioritize ball control and limiting turnovers, this could be a significant red flag.Financially, bringing Kirk Cousins to Pittsburgh won’t be easy. His contract is massive, and the Falcons are reportedly seeking a team willing to take on a substantial portion of his salary. This could become a major obstacle unless both teams agree to a restructuring deal. Still, if the Steelers decide that Cousins is the right fit, they may be willing to negotiate.Currently, the Steelers' quarterback depth includes Mason Rudolph, Skylar Thompson, and rookie Will Howard. While all three have potential, none bring the same level of experience or immediate impact that Rodgers or Cousins could offer. The Steelers are clearly looking for a proven starter to elevate their playoff hopes in a competitive AFC.Also Read: Are the Jets setting themselves up for disaster? Ignoring defensive tackles in record-breaking NFL Draft could be a colossal mistake In the end, the decision hinges on Aaron Rodgers’ choice. If he declines, the Steelers must weigh whether Kirk Cousins is worth the financial and performance risk. Either way, Pittsburgh Steelers appears committed to making a bold move at quarterback in 2025.","Pittsburgh Steelers have reportedly offered Aaron Rodgers a one-year deal worth $10 million.

How to play NYT Connections



Don't analyse the connections too deeply.

The game tends to employ simple links such as sounding similar, similar spellings, or common themes.

Example: ""dear"" and ""deer"" tend to be linked by sound, not by some elaborate relationship such as predator and prey.

You have only four guesses per puzzle per day, so every guess matters.

Don't mindlessly click—consider each set carefully before submitting.

Try to come up with at least three connected words confidently before trying a set.

The initial organization is deliberately mischievous to mislead you.

Shuffling the words may allow you to see new patterns or concealed connections.

Shuffle it as a routine to begin and whenever you are stuck.

The moment was made even more emotional as it came just days after a beloved mural of Gigi and her father, Kobe Bryant, was vandalized in Los Angeles.From Los Angeles to global basketball circles, the name Gianna Bryant , known affectionately as “Gigi” and “Mambacita,” still echoes with deep meaning. On Thursday morning, Vanessa Bryant shared a birthday message on Instagram that read, “Happy birthday, Gigi! Mommy loves and misses you more than I could ever express. I love you Gianna. ❤️19 ♉️ 5/1 #Mambacita.” It was a simple yet deeply moving tribute that quickly garnered love and support from fans, athletes, and brands across the sports world.Gigi, the daughter of NBA legend Kobe Bryant , was just 13 when she and her father tragically died in a helicopter crash on January 26, 2020, along with seven others.Nicknamed “Mambacita,” Gigi was seen as the heir to Kobe’s legacy. He even trademarked the name for her in December 2019, recognizing her growing talent and fierce passion for basketball. She embodied the same Mamba Mentality that her father was known for—relentless, fearless, and unapologetically determined with a drive well beyond her age.Over the years, more than 330 murals have popped up across California honoring Kobe and Gigi. But just days before Gigi’s birthday, one of the most beloved murals in L.A., a portrait of the father and daughter, was defaced with black paint. The timing hit hard. It rattled fans and added even more emotional weight to a week that was already tough for Vanessa, who also has a birthday coming up on May 5. Moments like these are a painful reminder that grief doesn’t follow a calendar; it lingers quietly, then roars back without warning, especially on days meant to celebrate.To honor Gigi, Nike released a special edition “Mambacita” Kobe 9 sneaker on May 1, designed in partnership with the Bryant family. Inspired by Gigi’s drive and spirit, the shoe represents her commitment to excellence and her dream to elevate girls’ sports.Through the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation, Vanessa continues to champion those values, investing in youth athletics and pushing for gender equality in sports.Also Read: ‘Kobe' Chant: How a comedic skit sparked a global tradition and a classroom tribute that moved Vanessa Bryant May 1 will always be more than just a date for Vanessa Bryant; it’s a reminder of her daughter’s spirit, her dreams, and the powerful impact she left behind.

What is the Light and Dark Alignment System?

How to Complete Light & Dark Side Community Alignment in Fortnite



XP and rewards

Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 has brought a galactic shake-up with its Star Wars crossover, and leading the charge is the all-new Light and Dark Alignment system. It’s not just about skins and cosmetics anymore. Your choices in-game now steer your path toward the Light or Dark side, influencing gameplay perks, XP rewards, and even the wider Fortnite island.In simple terms, Fortnite now allows you to pledge allegiance to the Rebel Alliance (Light Side) or the Empire (Dark Side). This isn’t a permanent decision, players can shift their allegiance as the season progresses - but committing to one path can accelerate yourXP gain and unlock exclusive features.Your personal alignment bar is fueled by quests tied to each side. For Light Alignment, players need to complete tasks like opening supply chests at Rebel Outposts, travelling specific distances, and using abilities like Force Push/Pull from Jedi Training Rifts. Dark Alignment focuses on more aggressive tactics - raiding First Order Bases, eliminating players, and mastering Force Lightning abilities.Each Alignment quest gives you 3,000 XP. Completing five such quests triggers a weekly Alignment Progress mission, which offers a hefty 30,000 XP bonus. Altogether, the Alignment system has 20 stages per side - meaning players can earn over 100,000 XP just by sticking to the grind. This is a substantial boost, especially for those chasing Battle Pass tiers.The system isn’t just personal, there’s a global component too. The entire Fortnite community contributes to a collective Alignment bar, visible in the quest tab. As the global bar fills, all players benefit from perks like storm forecasting or increased loot chances. The more one side dominates, the more it shapes the map dynamics.Those loyal to the Light side can expect defensive advantages, while Dark side followers enjoy aggressive perks such as shield regeneration in combat. Additionally, defeating iconic Star Wars bosses like Darth Vader or Captain Phasma not only boosts your alignment but also drops powerful mythic gear.Start early by visiting faction hubs to farm bars and complete quests without interruption. While experimenting with both sides is allowed, players looking for efficiency may want to fully commit to one path.With the Force in your hands, your alignment could define the outcome of this galactic season.","The Light and Dark Alignment system has 20 stages per side.

SAN FRANCISCO: Spend enough time in San Francisco, peering into the cyberpunk future, and you may find that weird things like self-driving cars and woolly mammoths start seeming normal.On Wednesday night, people waited impatiently in a crowded room in the Marina district, gazing into a glowing white sphere known as the Orb, having your eyeballs scanned in exchange for cryptocurrency and something called a World ID. The event was hosted by World, a San Francisco startup co-founded by Sam Altman of OpenAI that has come up with one of the more ambitious (or creepy, depending on your view) tech projects in recent memory.Its basic pitch is : The internet is about to be overrun with swarms of realistic AI bots that will make it impossible to tell if we're interacting with real humans on online spaces. To solve this , World has created a program called World ID that will allow users to verify their humanity online. To enroll, users stare into an Orb, which collects a scan of their irises and provide them a unique biometric identifier via an app.In exchange, users receive a cryptocurrency called Worldcoin , which they can spend, send to other World ID holders or trade for other currencies. (As of Wednesday night, the sign-up bonus was worth about $40.) At the event, Altman pitched World as a solution to the problem he called ""trust in the age of AGI."" ""We wanted a way to make sure that humans stay special and central in a world where the internet was going to have lots of AI-driven content,"" he said.","San Francisco startup World has created a program called World ID.

"‘Veeraswamy’, oldest Indian restaurant in Britain, under threat of closure as Crown Estate refuses to renew lease",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/veeraswamy-oldest-indian-restaurant-in-britain-under-threat-of-closure-as-crown-estate-refuses-to-renew-lease/articleshow/120288756.cms,"Veeraswamy Restaurant in London (Image Credit: X/@theveeraswamy)

TOI Correspondent from London:

Over the years, patrons of Britain’s oldest Indian restaurant, ‘Veeraswamy’, have included Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Charlie Chaplin, Winston Churchill, Marlon Brando, Sharon Stone and David Cameron.A haunt of Indian maharajas and European royalty too, the King of Denmark even shipped out a cask of Carlsberg for staff to store for whenever he dined there.Now the Michelin-starred restaurant , which opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London, and today serves pineapple curry and chicken makhana au vin, is at threat of closure as the Crown Estate (property portfolio owned by King Charles), which owns Victory House, the building in which the restaurant is based, is refusing to renew its lease, which expires in June.The Crown Estate claims it needs to take the restaurant space back to extend the ground floor reception for offices on the building’s upper floors. Knocking through into Veeraswamy would give it an extra 11 sq mts.Veeraswamy’s founder, Edward Palmer, was the great-grandson of General William Palmer, and his wife, Begum Faiz Baksh, a Mughal princess. Gen Palmer was private secretary to Warren Hastings, first governor-general of the Presidency of Fort William. It was acquired by Ranjit Mathrani and Namita Panjabi in 1996.“Had they wanted to, they could’ve easily put the office reception on the first floor. I think they’ve come to the view that it’s too tiresome having a restaurant there, they want it to be all offices,” Mathrani (81), told the Times of London.If the Crown Estate refuses to allow the restaurant to stay put until he finds and fit out an alternative space, with its iconic décor inspired by the art nouveau of the 1920s and maharaja’s palaces, the restaurant will have to close, leading to possible redundancies and loss of business until a new site is found.Mathrani is taking the Crown Estate to court.A spokesperson for The Crown Estate told TOI: “The Crown Estate has a duty to generate value for the nation, while acting as responsible stewards for this historic part of London. We need to carry out a comprehensive refurbishment of Victory House. This includes a major upgrade to the offices and improving the entrance to make it more accessible. Due to the limited options available in this listed building we need to remove the entrance to the restaurant, which means we will not be able to offer Veeraswamy an extension when their lease expires.”","Michelin-starred restaurant Veeraswamy opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London.

These officials hold crucial positions in managing foreign relations and national security matters, including negotiations with Vladimir Putin regarding the Ukraine conflict.The images were taken at a White House cabinet meeting in Washington DC on April 30, 2025. The modified application, TM SGNL, is developed by TeleMessage, a company that replicates messaging applications with additional archiving capabilities.According to 404 Media's analysis, whilst this archiving feature might help comply with presidential record-keeping requirements, it potentially compromises the end-to-end encryption that makes standard Signal secure, as messages can be retrieved from storage.Visible in the photographs were partial message contents, including a message to ""Rubio"" stating ""there is time"" and one from ""Vance"" reading ""I have confirmation from my counterpart it's turned off. He is going to be here in ..."" The screen also showed evidence of a call to Gabbard and an 8am ""PDB"" meeting schedule.Following these events, Trump reassigned Waltz to the position of UN ambassador on Thursday, with Rubio assuming the role of interim national security adviser. The White House's official response maintained that ""Signal is an approved app for government use and is loaded on government phones.""","New photo shows Mike Waltz using less secure version of Signal messaging app. Waltz was removed from his position as national security advisor and nominated for UN ambassador.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for Grand Theft Auto VI, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

“One evening over dinner in San Francisco, I was struck by an irresistibly simple idea. What if any developer from anywhere in the world could create their own applications for the Salesforce platform? And what if we offered to store these apps in an online directory that allowed any Salesforce user to download them?”

5 words from Steve Jobs that led Benioff to gift Apple AppStore.com

How App Store helped iPhone crush Nokia phones

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff once shared how a meeting with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs led to the idea of Salesforce’s app marketplace and how years later, he ‘gifted’ AppStore.com domain to Apple. In a 2019 interview with TechCrunch, Salesforce CTO and co-founder Parker Harris recalled how the idea of an app store came out of a meeting with Jobs. In 2003, Harris along with Marc Benioff and Dave Moellenhoff, visited Steve Jobs in Cupertino, he said.During the meeting, Jobs told the trio that to grow Salesforce, they needed to build a cloud software ecosystem. At that time, the idea of an app store was new for Salesforce, which had just launched (in 1999) as an online service to sell software over the internet.As the conversation moved forward, Benioff asked Jobs what exactly he meant by a cloud ecosystem. To this, Jobs replied that it was up to them to figure out.The idea stayed with Benioff, and a few years later, during a dinner in San Francisco, he thought of creating an online directory where developers could build and share apps for Salesforce users. Marc Benioff writes in his book, Trailblazer”Benioff quickly registered the domain AppStore.com to match his idea. However, when he discussed the name with customers, many did not like the name.Salesforce eventually launched the app marketplace in 2006 under the name AppExchange . In 2007, Salesforce also introduced Force.com, a platform for building and distributing apps through AppExchange.Meanwhile, AppStore.com remained unused.In 2008, Benioff attended a major Apple event where Jobs announced the launch of the App Store for iPhone . During the event, Jobs said five words — ""I give you App Store"" — which surprised Benioff and his team.After the event, Benioff met Jobs backstage and signed over the AppStore.com domain to Apple.The launch of the App Store became a major factor in the iPhone’s success. It created a marketplace for apps, which helped Apple strengthen its hold in the smartphone market and contributed to the decline of companies like Nokia. The Apple App Store then highlighted the importance of software and app ecosystems in the smartphone market, an area where Nokia struggled to compete effectively.Having said that, while the iPhone didn't single-handedly kill Nokia, the App Store's success demonstrated the demand for a wide variety of apps and the value of a user-friendly platform, which Nokia's Symbian and Windows Phone systems failed to deliver.","Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff once shared how a meeting with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs led to the idea of Salesforce’s app marketplace.

""Hi Googlers,

As recent moments like the Gemini 2.5 Pro launch and Cloud Next have shown, there's incredible momentum across the company right now — it's so exciting to see Googlers pull together to deliver on our ambitious product roadmaps. High performance is more important than ever to achieve the goals we've set, and so we're making some changes to further reward top contributors, in all teams across the company.

First, we'll increase the ratings distribution guidance we give to leaders for Outstanding Impact (O). This means more Googlers will have the opportunity to achieve that rating during annual reviews, and their bonus and equity award will be modeled using the O's individual multiplier in 2026.

Second, we're increasing the discretionary budget we give to managers so they can further reward high performers within the Significant Impact rating.

We want to be upfront that to fund this we'll be slightly reducing the bonus and equity individual multipliers for Significant Impact and Moderate Impact ratings. It's important to note that Significant Impact will remain a strong rating — achieving it will still get you more than your target bonus.

The above changes are budget-neutral, and overall we're continuing to invest in comprehensive and highly competitive compensation and benefits.

These changes apply to the end-of-year reviews and 2026 compensation planning.

John Casey""","Google's compensations head sent a letter to employees on Monday. The letter said high performance is more important than ever to achieve the company's goals.

Monaco E-Prix Round 6 highlights





Pit Boost in Formula E double-headers

Nissan driver Oliver Rowland won Part 1 of the Monaco E-Prix on Saturday. He is already leading the Formula E Drivers' Standings this year, and the much-awaited win adds to his score. Nyck de Vries of Mahindra Racing secured the second spot on the podium. Andretti driver Jake Dennis managed to claim the third spot despite a 5-second penalty.The race began with qualifying winner NEOM McLaren’s Taylor Barnard on pole position, followed by good friend — Nissan’s Oliver Rowland — and then Cupra Kiro driver Dan Ticktum, who topped both free practice sessions.The race ended early for TAG Heuer Porsche driver António Félix da Costa, who crashed into the wall and retired. He remains the only Formula E driver in the last five years to have won both pole and the race in the same event — in 2021. He had finished third in the previous race in Miami.Mitch Evans of Jaguar TCS Racing, who won the last Monaco E-Prix, came to a halt during the race and struggled to get going again, losing precious time as others overtook him.Oliver Rowland was among the first to use Attack Mode and established his dominance in the race. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries and TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein came close to Rowland when others took the mandatory Pit Boost. Soon after, Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy moved up to challenge for second position.Where did pole winner Taylor Barnard go? He crashed into the wall and was seen reversing his vehicle to rejoin the race. Andretti driver Jake Dennis could have secured a higher podium finish, but he was hit with a 5-second penalty for overspeeding during the full-course yellow when António Félix da Costa’s car was being removed from the crash site.Pit Boost is a feature introduced in Formula E double-headers. The electric Gen3 Evo cars receive a 10 percent energy boost (3.85 kWh) via a 30-second, 600kW charge in the pit lane. However, a driver can use this advantage only once across the two races in a double-header.","Nissan driver Oliver Rowland won Part 1 of the Monaco E-Prix on Saturday.

Ben Roethlisberger suggests Aaron Rodgers might be eyeing Minnesota instead of Pittsburgh

A Vikings move would echo Brett Favre’s final NFL chapter

The NFL offseason is often filled with speculation, but Aaron Rodgers’ prolonged free agency has taken center stage. Despite being one of the most decorated quarterbacks of his generation, the 4-time MVP has yet to commit to a new team after parting ways with the New York Jets. And now, former Steelers legend Ben Roethlisberger has added an intriguing twist to the saga.Aaron Rodgers has been linked heavily with the Pittsburgh Steelers, who still have a major gap at quarterback. With Mason Rudolph, rookie Will Howard, and Skylar Thompson filling the depth chart, there’s a clear opportunity for Rodgers to take over under center. But despite sightings of Rodgers working out with new Steelers addition DK Metcalf, no deal has materialized.Ben Roethlisberger addressed the situation on his podcast, Footbahlin with Ben Roethlisberger, saying: “I think Aaron secretly, again, just my opinion, I think Aaron is secretly still holding out for Minnesota, which is why he hasn’t signed with the Steelers.”He further added, “Why else would you go throw to DK and be working out, and put it out blast to everybody that I’m throwing to these guys, but you won’t sign?”The Minnesota Vikings could offer Rodgers a smoother fit. Their quarterback-friendly offense under Kevin O’Connell and elite weapons like Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison make them a compelling destination. Rodgers is also no stranger to the NFC North, having battled the Vikings for years as a Packer.This potential move would mirror the path taken by Rodgers’ mentor Brett Favre, who left the Packers for the Jets before ultimately joining the Vikings. Earlier this offseason, Favre even voiced his hope that Rodgers would follow a similar trajectory.Are the Vikings even interested? That’s the biggest unknown. The Vikings already invested in young talent like J.J. McCarthy, Sam Howell, and undrafted rookie Max Brosmer. McCarthy is reportedly ready to lead, which may close the door on Rodgers in Minnesota.Also Read: “Sue the NFL for racial discrimination”: Deion Sanders pressured to to sue NFL for $40 million over Shedeur Sanders’ shocking draft fall With limited options remaining, the Pittsburgh Steelers might be Rodgers' most realistic destination.

Maino questions age gap and maturity of Sharpe’s accuser in viral interview

Maino says he thought Shannon Sharpe was gay based on his persona

As Shannon Sharpe faces a $50 million sexual assault lawsuit that has rocked both sports and entertainment circles, rapper and media personality Maino has offered his candid — and controversial — take on the situation. In a recent interview with DJ Vlad, Maino not only weighed in on the nature of the allegations but admitted he was shocked by the accusations because he believed Sharpe was gay.When asked about the lawsuit involving the Club Shay Shay host, Maino began by addressing what he felt was a concerning age gap between Sharpe and the 19-year-old woman accusing him. Although the woman was legally of age, Maino expressed that it still felt ethically off.“A man can do whatever he want to do, right? But, you know, for me, personally, I wouldn't want to be laying in bed, jumping in the sack with a 19-year-old,” Maino said. “That's just a bit too young for me. Just the conversation, what we talking about, what we into. I don't really feel like we got much in common.”Maino didn’t stop there. He questioned the tone of the alleged victim’s text messages, implying they were overly scripted. “This didn't sound like a mature 19-year-old, she sound spectrumish,” he added. “Those text messages sound a little, you know, scripted. Like, 'I'mma say this just to get it on record.'”In perhaps the most headline-grabbing part of the interview, Maino revealed that the lawsuit took him by surprise because of how he previously perceived Sharpe’s sexuality. “Honestly, I thought he was gay,” Maino said. “100 percent. His name is Shay Shay, the way he talk. The way he move around. I thought he was gay, 100 percent. ... No disrespect. I'm not big on football... He wasn't really somebody I really knew about like that.”Sharpe has denied all allegations, maintaining that the relationship was “100 percent consensual.” In light of the lawsuit, he announced he would be stepping away from his ESPN duties, leaving fans and critics alike wondering what’s next.Also Read: Shannon Sharpe at the center of fresh controversy as cryptic post hint at secret damage control amid $50 million sexual assault lawsuit The case continues to stir intense reactions from across the sports and entertainment worlds — with Maino’s comments only adding fuel to the already controversial fire.","Maino says he thought Shannon Sharpe was gay based on his persona.
