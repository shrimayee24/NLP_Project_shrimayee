NEW DELHI: Posing questions to Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok that lead to inflammatory responses may result in criminal action against the user as well as the platform, official sources have said, just as the Centre told X (formerly Twitter) - which has filed a lawsuit in the Karnataka high court challenging what it calls Indian govt's unlawful content regulation and arbitrary censorship - that it needs to follow the law of the land on content takedown requests.Even as the chatter started getting thicker over the use of abusive words and slang by Grok in its Hindi responses to user queries, X decided to challenge the central govt in court over the interpretation of the Information Technology Act, particularly its use of Section 79(3)(b), which the micro-blogging platform has alleged violates Supreme Court's rulings and undermines free expression online.The petition, scheduled for hearing on March 27, seeks a declaration to the effect that Section 79(3)(b) does not vest the govt with powers to issue an order to block information posted on X. X argues that such an order can only be issued under Section 69A of the IT Act, read with the IT Rules, 2009.","Posing questions to Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok that lead to inflammatory responses may result in criminal action against the user as well as the platform, official sources have said.

Embrace Flexibility, But Stay Consistent

In the world of online education, flexibility is often touted as one of its greatest strengths. Yet, for many students, the traditional study schedules they attempt to adapt to don’t always mesh well with this flexibility. The typical school schedule, with its rigid start times and fixed periods, can be a poor fit for the dynamic nature of online learning. For online school administrators, instructors, and students alike, it's essential to recognize why this one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t work and, more importantly, how to design a study routine that fits the unique needs of online learners.Traditional school schedules are designed around the assumption that every student learns best within the confines of a structured day—typically with back-to-back lessons, a set lunchtime, and extracurricular activities. For online learners, however, this structure often feels more limiting than empowering. The beauty of online education lies in its ability to accommodate diverse learning styles, time zones, and life circumstances, but it’s easy for students to fall into the trap of trying to mimic an in-person schedule without considering the flexibility that online education offers.For many students, the rigid structure of traditional schooling can create unnecessary stress. It assumes a one-size-fits-all approach, often disregarding individual preferences, productivity peaks, and personal schedules. Students who attempt to fit into this mold may find themselves overwhelmed, frustrated, and struggling to balance their personal lives with their academic responsibilities.Online learning thrives on flexibility. Whether you're a morning person or someone who thrives late at night, you should have the freedom to choose when you engage with your course materials. This flexibility allows you to design your own study routine around your personal life and your peak productivity hours. But the key to making this work is creating a routine that is both manageable and sustainable.It’s tempting to think that without a fixed schedule, online students can simply ""study whenever."" But without some structure, it’s easy to procrastinate or feel lost in the sheer amount of content available. Creating a routine that balances flexibility with consistency is essential. For many online schools, this begins with encouraging students to take a proactive approach to their studies and providing guidance on how to develop personalized schedules.As an online student, the power is in your hands. You have the opportunity to design a study schedule that fits your needs, preferences, and lifestyle. Here are some practical tips for creating a routine that works for you:You know yourself better than anyone else. If you’re a morning person, start your study day early, diving into the most challenging subjects when your mind is fresh. If you’re a night owl, take advantage of the late hours to focus on your coursework. The flexibility of online learning allows you to structure your day around your most productive hours. Identify when you’re at your peak and plan your most intense study sessions during that time.Rather than trying to tackle hours of studying at once, break your day into smaller, focused study sessions. The Pomodoro Technique , which consists of 25-minute study intervals followed by a 5-minute break, is a popular method to boost focus and productivity. Longer breaks for meals or exercise should be incorporated as well. This approach not only helps to maintain focus but also ensures you don’t burn out by the end of the day.Utilize online calendars, task management apps, and reminders to track assignments and deadlines. This makes it easier to stay on top of your coursework and plan your study sessions in advance. Whether you prefer Google Calendar , Trello, or any other tool, having a clear overview of what’s due and when can keep you focused and prevent procrastination.Online learning requires a certain level of self-discipline, and prioritization is key. You might have multiple assignments, projects, and exams to juggle at once, but identifying which tasks require the most attention will help you manage your time more effectively. Make sure you allocate time for both urgent and important tasks, and don’t forget to schedule some ""buffer time"" for unexpected delays or changes.It’s easy to get caught up in the demands of coursework and forget to take care of yourself. However, self-care is essential to maintaining your mental and physical well-being. Incorporate regular exercise, social time, and relaxation into your routine. By maintaining a balanced lifestyle, you’ll ensure that you have the energy and focus necessary to perform at your best in your online courses.Your study environment plays a significant role in your ability to focus and absorb information. Choose a space that is quiet, comfortable, and free from distractions. If possible, designate a specific area in your home solely for studying to help your brain associate that space with focused work. This simple change can help you establish a clear boundary between ""study time"" and ""downtime.""=While flexibility is a defining feature of online learning, consistency is what makes a routine truly effective. As an online student, it’s important to strike a balance between having the freedom to study on your terms and creating a routine that ensures progress and success. Regularly revisiting and adjusting your schedule as needed will keep you on track without feeling overwhelmed.By taking control of your own study routine, you have the opportunity to create a balanced, sustainable approach to learning that fits your unique needs and lifestyle. Remember, there’s no ""right"" way to do it—what matters most is finding a routine that works for you.","For many students, the rigid structure of traditional schooling can create unnecessary stress.

Parents’ Guide to Balancing Sibling Dynamics During Online Schooling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/india-schools-online/parenting-in-the-digital-education-era/parents-guide-to-balancing-sibling-dynamics-during-online-schooling/articleshow/119282734.cms,"Understanding the Challenges

Creating a Structured Routine

Designate Study Zones: Set up individual study spaces for each child. This could mean different rooms, corners of a room, or even specific seating arrangements at the kitchen table. Make sure these areas are free from distractions, with enough space to work comfortably.



Create a Schedule with Set Times for Breaks: Breaks should be built into the schedule for everyone, including siblings. Make sure to coordinate break times so they are not overlapping too much, especially if your children share a workspace.



Introduce Quiet Time : This can be a daily ritual where everyone does something quietly, such as reading, journaling, or even just relaxing. This time can help maintain peace and allow each child to recharge before the next session of focused work or learning.



: This can be a daily ritual where everyone does something quietly, such as reading, journaling, or even just relaxing. This time can help maintain peace and allow each child to recharge before the next session of focused work or learning. Utilize Flexible Learning Hours : If possible, take advantage of the flexibility that online learning offers. If you have children at different academic levels, they may benefit from staggered learning sessions. This way, the younger child can get attention while the older sibling focuses on their work or vice versa.

Managing Interruption and Distraction

Set Clear Expectations: Be clear with your children about the importance of respecting each other’s learning time. Let them know that interruptions should be kept to a minimum, and establish a system where they can signal when they need something—whether it’s a simple hand raise or a written note.



Reward Positive Behavior: When siblings respect each other’s learning time, make sure to praise them for their cooperation. Positive reinforcement can go a long way in encouraging a calm, productive environment.



Incorporate Active Play: Physical activity and playtime are important for children’s mental and physical health. Encourage your kids to engage in some form of play or exercise during breaks. This helps them release energy and return to their studies refreshed and ready to focus.



Communication is Key: If conflicts arise between your children, try to address the situation calmly and help them communicate their needs and frustrations. This teaches them important conflict-resolution skills that will benefit them both in and out of school.

Recognizing Each Child’s Needs

Provide Individual Support: Spend time with each child individually, helping them with their assignments, guiding them through lessons, or answering questions. This helps them feel valued and less likely to feel frustrated by their siblings’ needs for attention.



Encourage Independent Learning: Empower your older children to take on more independent learning, using tools like online resources, self-paced assignments, and project-based learning. This can help them feel more confident in their abilities and reduce the dependency on you for support.



Foster Cooperation Instead of Competition : Help your children understand that success doesn’t have to be a competition. Encourage them to support each other, whether that’s by sharing study tips, helping with homework, or working together on a group project.

Managing Conflict and Building Emotional Intelligence

Teach Empathy: Encourage your children to consider each other’s feelings. Help them understand that while one child may need quiet to concentrate, the other might be feeling overwhelmed and need a break from their work.



Model Conflict Resolution: When conflicts arise, show your children how to resolve them respectfully. Use “I” statements, such as “I feel frustrated when you interrupt my work,” and encourage your children to do the same.



Set Boundaries: It’s important to establish and enforce boundaries when necessary. If a conflict escalates, take the time to separate your children for a brief period to cool down and reflect before they try to resolve the issue.

Online schooling offers flexibility and convenience, but it also presents unique challenges for families. Among the most prominent hurdles is managing sibling dynamics while juggling the needs of different students in a home environment. Whether your children are attending classes simultaneously or at different times, the interactions between siblings can greatly impact their ability to focus and succeed. The online school, in its experience with families navigating this transition, understands how important it is for parents to create an environment that promotes harmony and productivity for every child.Unlike traditional in-person schooling, online learning is often conducted in home environments where siblings of various ages and personalities share space. This can lead to competition for resources like quiet spaces, devices, and the attention of parents. Younger children might demand more attention, interrupting older siblings during study hours, while older children might feel frustrated with the interruptions or perceive the younger siblings as distractions. Additionally, each child might be at a different academic level, which can create further challenges when they need different kinds of support.Online schools should also recognize that creating a balance between helping your children focus on their studies and ensuring positive sibling relationships can feel daunting. However, it’s entirely possible with a few adjustments to your routine and mindset.One of the most effective ways to manage sibling dynamics is by establishing a structured routine. By having set times for schoolwork, play, meals, and quiet time, your children can better anticipate their day and understand when they will have to focus and when they will have time for other activities.You can consider implementing the following strategies to structure your day:As much as we’d like a quiet environment, the reality of family life can sometimes lead to distractions—particularly when multiple children are attending online classes in the same space. Sibling rivalry can also emerge if one child feels they are being overlooked or that their siblings are interrupting their focus.To help manage interruptions, you may want to try the following:Each child’s learning style, needs, and attention span can vary greatly. While one child may be able to work independently, another may require more one-on-one support. This can cause tension if one sibling feels that their needs are not being met.As a parent, it’s essential to address each child’s unique needs with care:Conflicts between siblings are a natural part of growing up. However, learning to resolve these conflicts constructively is an essential life skill. Online school can be a great opportunity for your children to practice emotional intelligence and conflict resolution as they navigate their sibling dynamics.Here are some tips to help guide your children through difficult situations:","Set up individual study spaces for each child. Establish a daily ritual where everyone does something quietly, such as reading, journaling, or even just relaxing. Encourage Independent Learning, using tools like online resources, self-paced assignments, and project-based learning.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119282849,imgsize-99169,width-400,resizemode-4/119282849.jpg"

Did it take off without a wheel?

Smooth landing, rough questions

Passengers aboard Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight PK-306 got an unexpected surprise when their aircraft landed in Lahore—with one of its rear wheels missing. Despite what sounds like a scene from an action movie, the landing was smooth, and no injuries were reported.The big mystery now: Did the wheel vanish midair or was it never there to begin with?PIA officials have launched an investigation to determine whether the aircraft took off from Karachi already missing a wheel or if it fell off during takeoff. Some wheel fragments were reportedly found at Karachi airport, raising eyebrows about the plane’s condition before departure.""It appears that one of the rear wheels was in shabby condition when the aircraft took off,"" an official admitted, reported PTI.PIA’s damage control mode kicked in quickly. A spokesperson assured that the landing was “smooth and uneventful,” and passengers disembarked as usual—only for the captain’s routine inspection to reveal the missing wheel .""Passengers disembarked as per routine. During a walk-around inspection by the aircraft captain, it was revealed that one out of the six-wheel assemblies on the main landing gear (rear) is missing,"" a PIA spokesperson said, quoted PTI.""As per the standard flight practices, the matter was taken up by PIA flight safety and the Lahore airport teams who are investigating the matter and will submit their report later,"" the spokesperson said.While officials claim the aircraft is designed to handle such contingencies, the biggest question remains—was the wheel stolen? Although unlikely, investigators are leaving no stone unturned.One thing’s for sure—this flight gave ""landing on your last leg"" a whole new meaning!","Passengers aboard Pakistan International Airlines flight PK-306 got an unexpected surprise when their aircraft landed in Lahore.

3% admission rate? Why Harvard's new introductory math course is under fire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/3-admission-rate-why-harvards-new-introductory-math-course-is-under-fire/articleshow/119258283.cms,"A New Approach to Foundational Math



Social Media Reactions and Concerns



The Bigger Picture: Admissions and Academic Standards



Harvard University is introducing a new introductory math course, Math MA5, to address gaps in foundational algebra skills among its students, according to The Harvard Crimson. The pilot program, announced on March 19, 2025, via X by tech investor Elad Gil, has ignited discussions about the selectivity and outcomes of Harvard’s highly competitive 3% acceptance rate.Math MA5 will run alongside the existing Math MA and MB courses but will feature an expanded five-day schedule. Harvard’s Director of Introductory Math, Brendan A. Kelly, described the course as offering “a variety of different activities” on Tuesdays and Thursdays to support students identified through a pre-term skill check. The curriculum will focus on algebra, geometry, and quantitative reasoning—essential skills for success in Harvard’s demanding math programs.Gil’s post, which included a screenshot of The Crimson article, posed a provocative question: “What is Harvard's 3% admissions rate selecting for?” The inquiry has fueled heated discussions on social media, touching on broader concerns about elite education, diversity, and student preparedness in the post-Covid era.Commenters on X expressed a range of perspectives. Some, like Brian Edgeworth, emphasized the importance of math fundamentals, while others, such as Abhivendra Singh, lamented a perceived decline in academic standards. “Wow! Algebra used to be expected only 20 years ago,” Singh wrote, citing his experience hiring Harvard alumni over the years.Others suggested the admissions process may be prioritizing factors beyond academic preparedness. A user named stablekh referenced the 2023 US Supreme Court ruling that struck down race-based affirmative action, speculating that Harvard may now emphasize extracurriculars and socioeconomic diversity over traditional academic metrics.Elizabeth Knopf shared a personal anecdote about her brother’s application, noting his exceptional credentials—top of his class, a 1580 SAT score, numerous AP courses, and research at Stanford—yet highlighting application questions that focused heavily on race, LGBTQ+ identity, and diversity. “You’re going to be disgusted,” she warned, implying bias in the admissions process.Some took a broader view of the trend. Gabe Mays linked the new course to a larger shift in higher education, suggesting that an emphasis on easier degrees or remedial programs could have long-term consequences. Meanwhile, Arjun Narayan proposed a tech-driven alternative, tagging @MathAcademy and quipping, “The AI will do a better job than any professor could.”Harvard’s Class of 2027 saw a record-low 3.41% acceptance rate, reflecting the intense competition for admission. According to a January 2025 report from Shiksha.com, international students, including many from India, continue to face fierce odds in gaining entry.The launch of Math MA5 raises fundamental questions: Is Harvard’s admissions process selecting students who are fully prepared for its academic rigor? Or are external factors—such as pandemic-related learning loss and shifting diversity policies—reshaping the student body in unexpected ways?Supporters of Math MA5 argue that it reflects Harvard’s commitment to student success, ensuring that those admitted receive the support they need to excel. Critics, however, worry that such initiatives may dilute academic rigor or highlight failings in the K-12 education system.As the pilot program unfolds, it will serve as a key indicator of whether Harvard can effectively bridge these learning gaps—or whether deeper shifts in admissions and academic expectations are on the horizon.","Harvard University is introducing a new introductory math course, Math MA5, to address gaps in foundational algebra skills among its students.

Hundreds of Hollywood stars, including Ben Stiller and Cate Blanchett, have urged Trump's White House to protect film, TV and music copyrights against big tech and AI.

But ""weakening copyright protections"" and allowing tech giants to ""exploit America's creative and knowledge industries"" would threaten ""world's most vibrant creative economy"", the letter said.

A Japanese petition against the depiction of the samurai character got over 100,000 signatures.Seething tensions over South China Sea have struck an unlikely victim in Vietnam: popular dolls pulled from shops over a facial mark sup- posedly resembling Beijing's claims in the waterway.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

As the debates online are catching up with the rumors linked to Cobb’s name, his latest post on X has indeed stirred the pot, and his latest tease has left the fans wondering again.Cobb is currently one of the potential figures who could settle down a deal with WWE and probably make a main roster debut.

Taylor Swift’s iHeartRadio speech hides a secret—Fans think they’ve uncovered it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/taylor-swifts-iheartradio-speech-hides-a-secretfans-think-theyve-uncovered-it/articleshow/119260407.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Travis Kelce accidentally ‘discovered’ filming Taylor Swift’s iHeartRadio Awards video

Why did Taylor Swift skip the iHeartRadio Awards?

During her 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards acceptance speech Taylor Swift fueled speculation among fans more with her words than with the potential culprit who operated the camera. Swift attended the virtual event where she received the Tour of the Century award after delivering the message to her fans before Swifties noticed that her boyfriend Travis Kelce seemed to handle the filming duties.Social media went into full investigative mode after a TikTok user slowed down the video and zoomed in on the reflection in Swift’s trophy. In the blurred outline, many were convinced they could make out the Kansas City Chiefs tight end capturing the moment.""I KNEW HE WAS RECORDING,"" one excited fan commented. Another joked, ""Is the reflection of Travis in the room with us?""While some skeptics argued it could have been anyone, many fans pointed out that the video’s casual, intimate angle suggested someone close to Swift—making Kelce the obvious choice.Taylor Swift decided to accept her award through a virtual presentation which created speculation as she had attended the ceremony in past editions. The explanation behind her absence rests primarily on her hectic performance schedule during the Eras Tour through May but some viewers believe she found another reason to avoid the event.Presenting the Tour of the Century award at the Awards Show was comedian Nikki Glaser even though she shares a problematic relationship with Swift. Glaser publicly criticized Swift through insulting body comments in 2015. Later these comments reappeared after Swift freed her struggles with eating disorders. Some followers started to think that Swift stayed away from the event to avoid facing a possible uncomfortable meeting.Regardless of the theories, Swift’s speech focused on gratitude, reflecting on the two-year anniversary of the Eras Tour. ""You had the passion and generosity to care about traveling to see us on tour in all these places all over the world. It blows my mind. I'm never going to stop being grateful for it,"" she said.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s support and future plans revealed after Travis Kelce’s decision to continue NFL career Though Kelce hasn’t confirmed his behind-the-camera role, Swifties are convinced—and their detective skills rarely fail.","Travis Kelce accidentally ‘discovered’ filming Taylor Swift’s iHeartRadio Awards video.
