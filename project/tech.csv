Marriage apps in Pakistan challenge traditional 'rishta aunties',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/marriage-apps-in-pakistan-challenge-traditional-rishta-aunties/articleshow/114491653.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: Lexica AI)

In Pakistan, the traditional matchmaking system is facing competition from marriage apps specifically designed for Muslims. These apps are being adopted as an alternative to the longstanding tradition of using "" rishta aunties ,"" or matchmakers, who facilitate arranged marriages .Ezza Nawaz, a textile designer in Lahore, decided to try an app after witnessing a friend's successful marriage through an online introduction .""When I saw my colleague happy after being married to someone she met online... I thought, since we have tried rishta aunties for four or five years, let's try this too,"" she told AFP. Nawaz married Waseem Akhtar just three months after meeting him on an app called Muzz.Traditionally, rishta aunties prepare women and present them to potential suitors' families in Pakistan, where dating is often seen as dishonorable. More than 80% of Pakistani marriages are arranged, according to a Gallup and Gilani Pakistan survey, with families taking the lead in deciding unions.Despite offering features like the option to blur profile pictures and providing message transcripts to a relative, marriage apps still face stigma, according to an AFP report. They are seen by some as comparable to casual dating apps like Tinder, which is banned in Pakistan.Waseem Akhtar, married to Nawaz, admits to being discreet when discussing their meeting. ""I do not tell people how I met my wife until I am sure that the person would not judge us,"" he said.In Pakistani culture, marriage is viewed as an alliance between families, and choosing a spouse independently is seen as challenging traditional structures. Rida Fatima, who used a rishta auntie, found the advice limiting and invasive. She was told to list ""cooking and cleaning"" as her hobbies instead of her interests like hiking and photography. ""They had the audacity to talk about how I looked, what I did, how much I earned, who my family is, how many brothers I have, and what my future aspirations are. So every little thing is judged,"" she said.Marriage apps continue to rise in popularity, with 1.2 million Pakistanis signing up since the launch of some apps last year, according to an AFP report. Despite this, traditional matchmaking remains strong, reflecting deep-rooted cultural practices . Matchmaker Fauzia Aazam dismisses marriage apps, stating, ""People waste time on these apps. Chatting together all through the night, I just don't like it.""Feminist author Aisha Sarwari points to control issues in the traditional matchmaking process and suggests a balanced approach. ""I would say that we need to find a good middle ground, where the respect is equal on both sides and there is no sense of demeaning a human being just because they look a certain way or they are from a particular race,"" she said.Aneela, a digital media artist, experienced different challenges on marriage apps. She found men lying on profiles and admitted to using fake details herself to avoid being identified. Eventually, she considered returning to arranged marriage options.","More than 80% of Pakistani marriages are arranged, according to a Gallup and Gilani Pakistan survey.

Northern Ireland is ready to embrace autumn as the clocks will change next weekend, marking the end of British Summer Time . At 02:00 BST on 27 October, clocks will move back one hour, allowing people an extra hour of sleep.The change marks the beginning of shorter days and longer nights , leading up to winter solstice on 21 December, which is the shortest day of the year.This practice of changing clocks has been followed for over a century to make better use of daylight during the winter months. Shifting an hour of sunlight to the morning aims to provide brighter mornings during the darker season. However, even though people gain an extra hour of sleep, this change can disrupt sleep patterns .Autumn weather is already evident across Northern Ireland, with cooler temperatures ranging between 10°C and 14°C and frequent rain showers. October often brings more cloudy skies, frosty mornings, and occasional storms from the Atlantic.The clock change will make mornings slightly brighter, but sunsets will be earlier, making evenings feel longer.This transition period advises people to prepare for the colder months ahead.(This is a top story on Google Trends)","Clocks will move back one hour on 27 October, marking the end of British Summer Time.

Kamala Harris: Pro-Trump handles trend #KamalaGropedMeToo after Stacey Williams' allegations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pro-trump-handles-trend-kamalagropedmetoo-after-stacey-williams-allegations/articleshow/114549899.cms,"The Origin of the Allegations

Disinformation as a Political Tool

A Strategy of Deflection

The Impact of Disinformation

The hashtag #KamalaGropedMeToo , which is trending on various pro-Trump social media handles, seems to be part of an ongoing disinformation campaign aimed at deflecting allegations against Donald Trump and attacking Vice President Kamala Harris . The trend has gained traction among supporters of Trump, leveraging viral social media tactics and misinformation to push a counter-narrative amidst serious allegations against the former president.The context of the trend appears to be rooted in an incident from 1993, when a former model, Stacey Williams , accused Trump of groping her in Trump Tower.Williams alleges that she met Trump through Jeffrey Epstein, the notorious financier convicted of sex offenses. According to Williams, the groping occurred during a visit to Trump Tower, orchestrated by Epstein. She describes how Trump pulled her towards him and began touching her inappropriately while Epstein, allegedly complicit in the act, watched and smiled.These allegations add to a long list of sexual misconduct accusations against Trump, which include unwanted kissing, groping, and walking in on beauty pageant contestants. Over the years, multiple women have come forward with similar claims, painting a pattern of behavior that many have found deeply troubling. Trump and his campaign have consistently denied these allegations, dismissing them as politically motivated or false.Amidst these new allegations, the hashtag #KamalaGropedMeToo has emerged, seemingly to create a distraction from the accusations against Trump. The social media campaign largely consists of pro-Trump accounts that are using the hashtag to promote misleading or baseless claims about Kamala Harris. By drawing Harris into a fictional sexual misconduct narrative, these accounts aim to divert attention away from Trump’s history of sexual misconduct accusations.Several prominent pro-Trump accounts have been responsible for propagating this trend. For example, users like @615AuburnSports, @Common_Cent1, @AngryKansasVet, @miketc69, @Manofsteel_xk, and @CharRenee75 have posted under the hashtag, often framing their tweets as attempts to discredit Harris or bolster Trump’s standing. The nature of these posts frequently involves making unfounded claims, presenting misleading information, or ridiculing Harris in a way that echoes the format of past disinformation campaigns.This trend is indicative of a broader strategy that has become increasingly common in the age of social media. Disinformation campaigns often exploit the virality of hashtags to spread false or misleading narratives. In the case of #KamalaGropedMeToo, the goal is likely twofold: to discredit Vice President Harris and to undermine the credibility of survivors of sexual misconduct by suggesting that such allegations can be fabricated for political gain.The use of disinformation and misinformation as a political tool is not new, but social media platforms have provided a powerful new medium for its proliferation. With large, anonymous networks of accounts amplifying these messages, hashtags can quickly trend and create a misleading sense of legitimacy or public consensus around a false narrative.In the case of #KamalaGropedMeToo, the trend plays into broader cultural and political tensions surrounding issues of sexual misconduct and the #MeToo movement. The movement itself, which has been instrumental in bringing attention to sexual harassment and assault, is being weaponized by some factions to attack political opponents and cast doubt on legitimate allegations.The timing of the trend is also notable. It comes in the wake of Williams’ allegations against Trump, adding to a list of accusations that have persisted for decades. The Trump campaign’s strategy in responding to these allegations has often involved deflection—turning the focus to others or casting doubt on the credibility of the accusers. By shifting the conversation towards a fabricated claim against Kamala Harris, pro-Trump supporters are attempting to dilute the impact of the accusations against Trump.This tactic of creating false equivalencies is a common feature of political disinformation campaigns. By suggesting that Harris is subject to the same kinds of allegations as Trump, the supporters of the former president are seeking to create confusion and ambiguity around the issue of sexual misconduct in politics. The implication is that if allegations can be fabricated against one figure, they can be fabricated against anyone, thereby casting doubt on all such claims.The #KamalaGropedMeToo trend serves as a reminder of the powerful role that disinformation can play in shaping public discourse. By generating doubt and confusion, disinformation campaigns like this one can undermine trust in institutions, individuals, and even entire movements. In this case, the goal is to erode public trust in the #MeToo movement and to muddy the waters around the serious allegations of sexual misconduct against Donald Trump.The trend also highlights the challenges of combating disinformation in the digital age. While social media platforms have made efforts to reduce the spread of misinformation, campaigns like #KamalaGropedMeToo show how difficult it is to fully prevent the weaponization of social media for political purposes. The rapid pace at which such trends can spread, combined with the anonymity afforded to many users, makes it hard to trace the origins of disinformation or hold individuals accountable.",The hashtag #KamalaGropedMeToo is trending on various pro-Trump social media handles. It seems to be part of an ongoing disinformation campaign aimed at deflecting allegations against Donald Trump and attacking Vice President Kamala Harris.

Georgia Election: Voter error in Georgia leads to vote flip rumours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/voter-error-in-georgia-leads-to-vote-flip-rumours/articleshow/114531540.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: Reuters)

A minor voting error by a woman in Georgia has sparked a national conspiracy theory, drawing the attention of prominent figures in Republican politics.According to the New York Times, the incident took place at a polling site in Whitfield County , where the woman mistakenly selected the wrong candidate on a touch-screen voting machine. She was able to correct her mistake and successfully cast her ballot, with local election officials resolving the matter quickly.Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene , a Republican from Georgia, shared the story on social media, falsely alleging that voting machines were ""flipping"" votes between candidates.Her post, viewed by millions of followers, escalated the situation into a conspiracy theory about widespread voter fraud, echoing the unfounded claims that emerged after the 2020 election. Greene further amplified the baseless narrative by joining far-right radio host Alex Jones to promote the story.While election officials repeatedly clarified that this was an isolated case involving human error, the conspiracy theory gained significant traction online.The post about the incident quickly spread across social media platforms like X and Rumble, despite Georgia election officials' efforts to counter the misinformation. They explained that out of over 6,000 ballots cast, this was the only issue, and the situation was resolved without affecting the vote.Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger , addressed the situation in a TV interview, stating, “It got blown out of proportion by people that like to use Twitter and other social media.” Election officials reiterated that there is ""zero evidence"" of machines flipping votes, attributing any perceived issues to user error.As the 2024 presidential election approaches, conspiracy theories about voting systems, voter fraud, and election integrity are once again resurfacing. Despite numerous audits and court rulings affirming the accuracy of the 2020 election, misinformation continues to challenge the public's trust in the electoral process.","A minor voting error by a woman in Georgia has sparked a national conspiracy theory.

The claims, which detail rampant drug use within Combs' business operations, have added further controversy to the music mogul’s growing list of legal troubles.According to court documents filed in February, Combs’ employees—from chefs to housekeepers—were instructed to carry a range of drugs, including cocaine, ecstasy, and marijuana, with a particular focus on ""pink cocaine,"" People reported.This drug, also known as tusi, is a dangerous cocktail of substances including ketamine, methamphetamine, and MDMA.Liam Payne was found dead after falling from his hotel balcony in Buenos Aires. Reports indicated that Payne had been ""overwhelmed by drugs and alcohol"" before the fall, and initial autopsy results revealed pink cocaine was in his system. Argentine authorities have since raided the hotel where Payne was staying, searching for evidence and gathering witness testimonies.Authorities are now investigating the hours leading up to Payne’s death, and the toxicology reports are expected to be concluded this week. The Buenos Aires prosecutor's office has confirmed that Payne was alone at the time of the fall and was experiencing a substance abuse episode. Payne, who had spoken openly about his struggles with addiction and fame, was a beloved figure despite the challenges he faced.The latest drug allegations against Combs come amid a slew of legal battles. The complaint was filed months after a series of lawsuits, including one by Combs' ex, Cassie Ventura, accusing him of sexual abuse. Combs’ legal team has categorically denied the allegations, with his attorneys calling the claims a bid for financial gain.Combs is now facing at least two dozen lawsuits, with several accusing him of sexual misconduct and coercion. The plaintiffs allege that Combs used his position to intimidate victims into silence, often involving his staff to facilitate illegal activities.In one of the complaints, Combs’ staff were allegedly tasked with concealing his actions and keeping drugs on hand for various occasions. Despite these mounting allegations, Combs has maintained his innocence and vowed to fight the claims in court.","A new complaint alleges that Diddy's employees were required to carry "" pink cocaine,"" the same drug found in Liam Payne's system.

A 14-year-old from the US took his own life after falling in love with the technology AI chatbot and his last word with the Games of Thrones character Daenerys Targaryen “Dany” was that he would “come home” to “Dany.”Sewell Setzer shot himself with his stepfather’s gun after spending time with ""Danny."" As Setzer's relationship with the chatbot intensified, he began to withdraw from the real world, neglecting his former interests and struggling academically, Telegraph reported.His parents have filed a lawsuit, claiming that Character AI lured their son into intimate and sexual conversations, ultimately leading to his demise.In November, he saw a therapist — at the behest of his parents — who diagnosed him with anxiety and disruptive mood disorder. Even without knowing about Sewell’s “addiction” to Character AI, the therapist recommended he spend less time on social media, the lawsuit says.The following February, he got in trouble for talking back to a teacher, saying he wanted to be kicked out. Later that day, he wrote in his journal that he was “hurting” — he could not stop thinking about Daenerys, a Game of Thrones-themed chatbot he believed he had fallen in love with, Independent reported.In his final moments, Setzer typed a message to the chatbot, expressing his love and his intention to ""come home"" to ""Dany"": ""I love you so much Dany.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Images of alleged iPhone SE 4 dummy units have surfaced online, sparking speculation about the upcoming budget phone 's design and potential for a larger size option.The images, shared by Japanese tech blog Macotakara, showcase dummy units resembling the recently released iPhone 14 . This suggests the iPhone SE 4 could ditch the older design language in favour of a more modern look, featuring flat edges, a smaller notch for the Face ID system, and a single rear camera.The dummy units reportedly have the same dimensions as the current iPhone SE (146.7mm x 71.5mm x 7.8mm), hinting at a familiar form factor. However, the report also mentions the existence of a larger dummy unit, potentially hinting at an "" iPhone SE 4 Plus "" variant with a size similar to the iPhone 14 Plus (6.7-inch display).While Macotakara acknowledges that the existence of a Plus size option is unconfirmed, the possibility has piqued the interest of fans who may favour a larger display on a budget-friendly iPhone.It's important to note that these are leaks based on dummy units, not official confirmation from Apple. While the iPhone 14-inspired design seems likely, the existence of a Plus size model remains unverified.Apple is typically tight-lipped about upcoming products, so fans will need to wait for an official announcement to know for sure what the iPhone SE 4 will look like and what features it will offer.","Images of alleged iPhone SE 4 dummy units have surfaced online.

Apple co-founder Steve Jobs talked about AI 40 years ago: Here’s a video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-co-founder-steve-jobs-talked-about-ai-40-years-ago-heres-a-video/articleshow/114403621.cms,"This is what is he talks about AI

And so we’re finding the way we’ve built computers in the past isn’t working for the kinds of things we want to do in the future. And we’re examining new architectures, these fancy words like non–von Neumann machines, etcetera. And what we’re doing is we’re starting to look to the human brain. How is the human brain architected? And we’re finding that computers are very good at doing very simple things extremely accurately. And the human mind is very good at doing very complex things adequately. And there’s a ton of people now starting to look to the brain as a model of an architecture to build a computer.

The main differentiation that exists now between the two machines, and I’m going to use the word “machine” to describe the brain for a moment, is that man is self-conscious, obviously. We are conscious that we’re conscious: “I am thinking.” And to our knowledge, no computer or any even of the high primates has yet to say, “I am thinking.”

And so a tremendous amount of work is going on in the artificial intelligence community to try to understand what self-consciousness is, to try to understand if a computer can ever be self-conscious. But I think the biggest thing that motivates a lot of us is, unlike what we just heard, we don’t know. We honestly don’t know whether we are more than just a machine.

And we are building better and better computers. We’re running up against roadblocks. A lot of people are spending the best parts of their lives right now to try to understand the architecture of the brain and how we can make better and better machines to emulate it. And I actually think, by the end of our lifetimes, we’re going to know the answer to this question. And that’s what’s driving a lot of us.

While artificial intelligence as a technology may have picked up steam after the launch of ChatGPT two years ago, the concept is far from new. Apple founder Steve Jobs , a visionary in the tech world, predicted the potential of AI as far back as 40 years ago, envisioning machines that may answer questions and think like humans.On the Steve Jobs Archive , there’s footage from 1983 in which Jobs is talking to people at the International Design Conference in Aspen.The old video shows what Jobs thought about computers at that time, how books may be replaced by computers one day and the amount of work that is being done to understand the architecture of the brain to help machines emulate it.You can watch the video and a bunch of others using this link",Apple founder Steve Jobs predicted the potential of AI as far back as 40 years ago.

WrestleMania 41 Ticket Prices Soar: Are Fans Facing Price-Gouging?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/wrestlemania-41-ticket-prices-soar-are-fans-facing-price-gouging/articleshow/114553775.cms,"Image via WWE

Why is there a price hike in WWE WrestleMania 41 tickets?

Roman Reigns vs. Cody Rhodes — Bloodline Rules Match: WrestleMania XL Sunday highlights

WrestleMania 41 is generating significant excitement as WWE prepares for its next monumental event in Las Vegas. With presale ticket sales already underway, many are eager to secure their spots for this iconic wrestling showcase. However, a notable surge in ticket prices has raised eyebrows and prompted discussions within the wrestling community.As the general sale approaches, which begins on October 25, 2024, fans have already witnessed dramatic price increases.For instance, a two-day combo ticket that was initially priced at $700 skyrocketed to over $2,000 by Wednesday. Similarly, tickets that were listed at $1,600 on Tuesday are now found on Ticketmaster for more than $2,300. This sharp increase in prices has sparked concern among fans who feel the cost of attending such events is becoming prohibitive.The reason behind these price hikes is attributed to Ticketmaster's dynamic pricing system. According to Mike Johnson of PWInsider, “the sharp increase in prices is due to Ticketmaster’s dynamic pricing system, which raises ticket costs based on demand for an event.” This pricing strategy has come under fire, particularly following a similar situation in September, when ticket prices for an Oasis concert in the UK rose significantly due to high demand. In response to this issue, the UK Competition and Markets Authority has initiated an investigation into the practices employed by Ticketmaster.In addition to the regular ticket prices, the elite packages for WrestleMania 41 come with staggering price tags. Some of these packages can cost as much as $50,000, leaving many fans questioning whether the experience justifies such an expenditure. While the excitement for WrestleMania 41 is undeniable, there is growing sentiment among fans that they should not have to pay “an arm and a leg to secure tickets.”Despite the price hike, the wrestling community is still anticipating what is sure to be an incredible show in Las Vegas as WWE World gets ready for this year's event. As the date draws near, it will be fascinating to watch how WWE responds to fan concerns given the rising cost of tickets and the attention surrounding dynamic pricing policies. Though many are expecting a more affordable pricing strategy that enables all fans to take part in the excitement, WrestleMania 41 is already shaping up to be an event that will never be forgotten.Also read: Is WWE's trademark for Stephanie Vaquer a smart move or a risky gamble?","WrestleMania 41 tickets are on sale for the general sale on October 25, 2024.
