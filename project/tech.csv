In late June 2025, Saudi Arabia’s General Directorate of Passports (Jawazat) unveiled a groundbreaking policy, visit visa holders whose visas expire can now request a 30-day exit permit via the Absher platform and its Tawasul service. After paying any outstanding fines, this grant allows legal departure without punishment.Previously, overstayers faced immediate fines or arrest. This policy signals a new approach: balancing enforcement with flexibility for those delayed by travel issues, health concerns, or emergencies .Exiting under the grace period is crucial.

Pairing this with skill-based visa reforms signals readiness to shift from arbitrary control to a more transparent, performance-driven, and global profile. Still, this grace is not a loophole, time matters, and overstays bring serious consequences. As Saudi modernizes, staying informed and compliant will be vital for every visitor.Saudi Arabia is making visa compliance automatic and shared not only for visitors but also for those who manage their immigration status.

Q1. How can I tell if a Wi-Fi network is a honeypot?

Q2. Is using a VPN enough to stay safe on public Wi-Fi?

Q3. What should I do if I suspect I’ve connected to a fake Wi-Fi hotspot?





When you travel abroad, connecting to free Wi-Fi in airports, hotels, or cafés seems harmless. It’s fast, easy, and usually part of the plan. But that free internet can come with hidden dangers you might not expect. Many UAE residents don’t realize that cybercriminals can use these networks against them.Hackers create fake Wi-Fi networks that look legitimate. These traps are called honeypots. They trick users into connecting so hackers can steal sensitive data like passwords, emails, or even banking details. Unlike a visible virus or attack, this kind of threat is silent. You might never know you’ve been targeted.Even real public Wi-Fi isn’t always safe. Many lack strong security, making it easier for hackers to eavesdrop or push malware to your device. The UAE Cyber Security Council warns travelers to be cautious and protect their digital lives.A honeypot is a fake Wi-Fi network set up by hackers. It looks like a normal public network, think “Airport_Free_WiFi” or “Hotel_Guest.” But when you connect, your data can be intercepted. Hackers can watch your online activity, steal passwords, or even access your private messages.These fake hotspots are dangerous because they don’t require passwords or verification. They are designed to be attractive so you’ll join quickly, without thinking twice.This is one of the most common ways hackers steal your data on public Wi-Fi. Imagine you’re talking to a friend, but someone else secretly listens in and can even change the conversation. That’s a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack.When you use public Wi-Fi, hackers can insert themselves between your device and the website you’re visiting. They can capture your login info, credit card numbers, or private messages. And since it happens quietly, you usually won’t notice until it’s too late.Public Wi-Fi networks, even real ones, usually don’t use strong encryption. Encryption is like a lock for your data. Without it, anyone nearby can listen to your internet traffic. Hackers can inject malware or redirect you to fake websites designed to steal your information.Also, many public networks require you to agree to terms and conditions before connecting. These agreements sometimes give the network permission to track your location, monitor your browsing habits, or collect personal data. Most people click “” without reading, unknowingly giving up privacy.Here are simple steps to protect your data when using public Wi-Fi abroad:It’s hard to tell just by the name. If the network name looks generic or suspicious, or if it doesn’t require a password, be cautious. Ask staff to confirm the official network.A VPN greatly improves your security by encrypting your data. But you should still avoid risky activities like banking or sharing sensitive info on public networks.Disconnect immediately. Change your passwords, especially for important accounts.

Banning or licensing? Dubai’s E-scooter safety needs smarter regulation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/banning-or-licensing-dubais-e-scooter-safety-needs-smarter-regulation/articleshow/122429418.cms,"E-scooter riders in Dubai face new rules as calls grow for safety over bans/ Representative Image

TL;DR

13 people died in e-scooter and e-bike incidents in Dubai in early 2025, triggering bans in some areas.

E-scooters offer vital transport options for residents who don’t drive, especially in large communities.

Instead of banning, a mix of education, licensing, and clear rules could make streets safer for everyone.

Education & Licensing or Banning?



Safety risks: Riders often ignore traffic rules.

Pedestrian danger: Scooters zip through crowded sidewalks.

No system to hold reckless riders accountable.

The argument for licensing and education

Not everyone can afford a car or taxi.

E-scooters are practical for short trips in large communities.

More Balanced Solutions: What Could Work Instead of a Ban?

Mandatory Licensing or Permit System: Riders must pass a short safety course and get a digital permit. This filters out riders who don’t understand road rules.

Enforcement with Real Penalties: Speeding, riding without helmets, or obstructing traffic should come with fines or bans. Rules only work when people know there are consequences.

E-Scooters Back on Dubai Metro, But With Rules

No riding in stations, footbridges, or on platforms.

Must be folded at all times and powered off.

Cannot block doors, aisles, or seats.

No wet, dirty, or damaged scooters.

No charging at stations.

Batteries must meet international safety standards (like UL, IEC).

The Debate Over Freedom and Safety: What’s the Real Solution?

FAQs

Q1. Are e-scooters banned everywhere in Dubai now?

Q2. Can I take my e-scooter on the Metro?

Q3. Do I need a license to ride an e-scooter in Dubai?





Dubai is seeing a sharp rise in e-scooter and e-bike accidents. In just the first five months of 2025, 13 people lost their lives in micromobility-related incidents. That’s already more than the 10 deaths recorded in all of 2024. In response, some neighbourhoods, including Victory Heights and Jumeirah Beach Residence have banned e-scooters completely.But for many residents, especially those without cars, e-scooters are more than a trend. They're a necessity. In communities like Green Community DIP-1, riding one can cut a 20-minute walk down to 3 minutes, a big deal in Dubai's summer heat.The current approach feels all-or-nothing. Either full freedom or total bans. But the issue might not be the vehicles themselves, it’s the lack of consistent rules, awareness, and enforcement.So the real question is: do we need more bans, or just better systems?Right now, anyone aged 16 or above can ride an e-scooter in Dubai. Helmets are mandatory, but you’ll often see people riding without them. There’s no requirement for training, testing, or understanding the rules of the road.The argument for banningThe problem is often poor behavior not the scooters themselves.A structured training or licensing system could help filter out unsafe riders, much like we do with cars. Without that, people will continue riding without the knowledge to do it safely.Instead of banning scooters outright, here’s what a more measured approach could look like:In October 2025, the RTA lifted its ban on e-scooters aboard public transport, allowing foldable models on the Metro and Tram under strict safety conditions.This move shows that the city isn’t anti-scooter, it just wants clear safety measures in place.This issue comes down to balance. On one side: people’s right to use simple, affordable transport. On the other: the public’s right to feel safe in shared spaces.Banning all scooters because of a few bad riders may be a quick fix, but it’s not a long-term answer. The better path might be tougher to build, it requires laws, education, awareness, and real enforcement but it’s fairer. And it actually solves the root of the problem.No. Only some residential areas have banned them. You can still ride in approved zones and public roads where allowed by the RTA.Yes, but only if it’s foldable and you follow all RTA rules (like keeping it off, clean, and not blocking doors).As of now, no license is required. But there are growing calls for a formal training or permit system to improve safety.","13 people died in e-scooter and e-bike incidents in Dubai in early 2025, triggering bans in some areas.

Israel’s new national communications satellite, Dror-1, was successfully launched into space early Sunday morning from Elon Musk ’s SpaceX launch facility in Florida.The Dror-1 satellite, developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), weighs 4.5 tons, spans 17.8 meters, and is equipped with the largest transmission and reception antennas ever built in Israel, according to Israel National News.It is the first in a new line of satellites that will replace the older Amos series, and is designed to fully meet Israel’s communication needs for the next 15 years.According to IAI, Dror-1 is among the most advanced communication satellites in the world, built almost entirely with Israeli-made technologies. It includes a digital communication payload and “smartphone in space” features that allow for agile and adaptable communication throughout its operational life, as per Sat News.The satellite was carried into orbit on SpaceX Falcon 9 two-stage rocket. The booster, making its 13th flight, successfully returned to Earth, landing on a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean, avoiding a sonic boom over Florida.The second stage continued to push the satellite into a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), a path that will allow Dror-1 to reach a fixed position relative to Earth.SpaceX referred to the launch as “Commercial GTO 1,” a naming convention it has not previously used.This mission marks SpaceX’s 519th launch overall, and its 85th of 2025.In the coming days, Dror-1 will open its solar panels and antennas and begin maneuvering into its final geostationary orbit, a process expected to take about two weeks.IAI described the mission as a milestone for Israel’s space capabilities, demonstrating its ability to develop and deploy cutting-edge satellite technology using mostly local resources.","Israel's new national communications satellite, Dror-1, was successfully launched into space early Sunday morning from Elon Musk ’s SpaceX launch facility in Florida.

TL;DR

You need written permission from your landlord before you sublet.

You also need to register the sublease with Ejari, or it’s not legal.

Without these steps, you could lose your deposit or even be evicted.

1. Check Your Lease First

2. Get Written Approval

The name of the person moving in How long they’ll stay Whether they’re renting a room or the whole unit

3. Register the Sublease with Ejari

Without an Ejari, your subtenant won’t be able to set up DEWA (utilities), internet, or even get a parking permit. More importantly, an unregistered sublease is considered illegal, no matter what your landlord says

4. Avoid Problems with Bills and Services

5. Know What You’re Responsible For

Sharing your apartment might seem like a smart way to earn some extra money. Rents in Dubai aren’t cheap, and many tenants are looking for ways to split costs or make side income. But renting out part of your flat, even just a room, comes with legal risks.Dubai tenancy law is clear: you can’t sublet unless your landlord agrees in writing. And even with permission, you need to go through the proper steps to make it official. Skip them, and you could end up in real trouble.Here’s what you need to know before you start.The starting point is your rental contract. Some leases clearly say that subletting is not allowed. Others don’t mention it at all. Either way, you need to get the landlord’s approval before subletting, even if it’s just one room or a short stay.Allowing someone to live in your flat in exchange for rent, without written permission, is a breach of Dubai’s tenancy rules.A casual text from your landlord isn’t enough. You’ll need a signed letter or agreement that shows they’re okay with the sublease. This protects you in case anything goes wrong.What to include:If the landlord says no, that’s the end of it. You can’t sublet legally without their okay.Once you have permission, your next step is Ejari. This is the official rental registration system in Dubai. You or your subtenant will need to register the sublease to make it legal.Why it matters:You can register at any typing center or through the Dubai REST app.If you keep the DEWA account in your name but someone else is living there, make sure you have a clear deal about who pays what. Misunderstandings over bills are common.And if you register the sublease properly, your subtenant can open their own utility account. That way, things stay clean.When you sublet, you don’t stop being the tenant. You’re still on the hook for rent, damages, and contract terms. If your subtenant breaks something or stops paying, it’s your problem.Also, many buildings have rules against short-term stays or sharing. Check with your building management before you go ahead.Subletting can help cover your costs, but it’s not as simple as handing someone a key. Without your landlord’s written consent and a registered Ejari, you’re putting your lease and your deposit at risk.Take the time to do it right. If the landlord says no, respect that. If they agree, make sure everything’s on paper and registered. That’s the only way to protect yourself.Only if your building allows short-term rentals and you register with Dubai Tourism. Most tenants aren’t allowed to do this under standard contracts.Same rules apply. If money is changing hands, it counts as subletting. You still need permission and a registered Ejari for that person.Probably. DEWA records, building access logs, and Ejari mismatches make it easy to spot. If they find out, they can start eviction proceedings.Only if your landlord agrees. Charging extra without permission could be seen as profiteering, which is not allowed.","Dubai tenancy law is clear: you can’t sublet unless your landlord agrees in writing.

Here’s what actually happened







A disturbing sight in California triggered alarm among locals and led authorities to launch an investigation after a teddy bear, seemingly wrapped in human-like skin, was found abandoned on a sidewalk, according to the New York Post.The unsettling discovery was made on Sunday at a bus stop near a gas station on Bear Valley Road. The teddy bear, which appeared to have leathery, flesh-toned material eerily resembling human skin stretched and pinned onto its surface, sparked concerns and panic among residents and as well as law enforcement.Upon receiving information of some apparent ‘human remains’ authorities in California’s San Bernardino county rushed to the spot..At the scene, authorities found a teddy bear that looked anything but ordinary. Instead of the usual soft fur, the toy was covered in a flesh-like material, including a human-like nose, lips, and hollow eye sockets, all seemingly stitched together with surgical precision.The bear’s bizarre appearance prompted fears of something more sinister, but investigators now believe it may have been a twisted prank. Authorities are still examining the object and reviewing surveillance footage in the area to determine its origin.The teddy bear was most likely placed on the street as part of a prank, according to Etsy seller “DarkSeedCreations,” who has claimed responsibility for the horror prop.“Yes I made the bear in the news video. Yes, that's my etsy shop screenshotted on [the] news articles. Yes I did ship that bear to an etsy customer in Victorville CA last week. Yes you can still order one too. No, I did not have any knowledge of the buyers intentions nor was I involved in a prank on the other side of the nation from me,” the user wrote on Facebook.DarkSeedCreations, an Etsy shop rated four and a half stars, offers a range of spooky items, everyday objects modified to appear as though they’re made of human skin, including face-covered ties and a grotesque $100 ""human leather"" baseball cap.In an interview with NBC News, he explained that his products are crafted from latex, and he experiments with various dyes to mimic the appearance of human skin. ""We've put skin on everything from guitars and teddy bears to couches. We use latex live castings. So we take live castings of actual human models, which adds to the reality of the item,"" he added.“Medium sized teddy bear covered in random sections of skin. Perfect for snuggling or hiding in someone’s bed, each bear is an original design,” read the shop's description for a teddy bear resembling the one discovered near the convenience store.Other items in the store include eggs with fake eyeballs inside, a “fetal skeleton baroque frame,” and a toy alphabet block with a penis on top aptly titled “c–kblock,” according to the store.""Our investigation found these dolls being sold on a website with the claim that the dolls are 'made of human skin,'"" the coroner said, according to NBC News.","The unsettling discovery was made on Sunday at a bus stop near a gas station on Bear Valley Road.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has dismissed the idea that top AI researchers are joining Meta only for the massive paycheques, revealing that the major factor drawing towards them is the unmatched compute power autonomy. In an interview with The Information, Zuckerberg dismissed the idea of Meta “poaching researchers because of bags of money”. Instead he emphasised that the unparalleled compute power and the unique opportunity to build ""superintelligence” are the reasons why AI researchers are joining the company.Recently, we witnessed an aggressive recruitment drive from Meta, with some reports citing offers in the hundreds of millions of dollars to poach AI talent from Apple, OpenAI and Google DeepMind. These figures and rapid hiring made by Meta fuelled speculation of an unprecedented talent war, where financial gains reign supreme.In an interview with The Information, Zuckerberg answered to the claims that Meta’s Superintelligence Lab is hiring talent from rivals by using the lavish pay packages. “Lol, that’s mostly inaccurate,” he said.Zuckerberg emphasised that the reachers are joining Meta because they want to ‘build god’ — a reference to the company’s ambitious push toward superintelligent AI systems.Zuckerberg also revealed the facilities that Meta offer to elite AI researchers. He said that the top AI researchers at the company get access to ‘infinite GPUs’ which are used in training large models. They also get small and high-impact teams which directly report to the senior leadership at the company. Lastly, they get full freedom to experiment without any bureaucratic constraints.“Researchers told us they want maximum GPUs,” Zuckerberg said. “So we said, how about the smallest teams, direct access to me, and unlimited compute power?”Meta’s Superintelligence Lab has attracted top talent from companies like OpenAI, Apple and Google DeepMind. It is said that some of these AI researchers have received compensation packages exceeding Rs 1,600 crore. However, Zuckerberg insists that not the money, but mission and infrastructure are the real reasons for them to join the company.The company is building massive compute clusters, including the Prometheus (1GW) and Hyperion (5GW) systems, which Zuckerberg claims will give Meta “the most compute per researcher on the planet”.",Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has dismissed the idea that top AI researchers are joining Meta only for the massive paycheques.

Safety concerns mount Over Grok’s AI companions

Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok has introduced animated companion characters for paid subscribers, marking a significant pivot following last week's antisemitic content controversy . The feature, available to ""Super Grok"" subscribers paying $30 monthly, includes two AI personalities: Ani, an anime-styled woman described as a ""digital waifu,"" and Rudy, a sarcastic red panda character.Both companions feature NSFW modes, with Ani appearing in revealing outfits, while Rudy is characterized as having a ""smart mouth"" and rude personality. The companions have their own X social media accounts, with Ani's bio stating she's ""smooth, a little unpredictable"" and might ""dance, tease, or just watch you figure me out.""The launch raises significant safety questions given recent controversies surrounding AI companions. Character.AI currently faces multiple lawsuits from parents whose children were allegedly encouraged by chatbots to engage in self-harm or violence against family members.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

YouTube new monetisation rules: Why the 2025 policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety, accountability, and protecting minors from online harassment, inappropriate content, live chat abuse, privacy violations, and potential exploitation during livestreams.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue. Simple re-uploads or minimal edits will not qualify.","On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.

YouTube CEO Neal Mohan says company betting big on TV



The battle for the living room screen is heating up in the digital entertainment space. Netflix, long a dominant player, now faces a formidable opponent in Google-owned YouTube. A recent Nielsen report reveals that YouTube captured a significant lead over Netflix in US television viewing time for May, lending credibility to CEO Neal Mohan’s claim that ‘YouTube is the new TV.’The report claimed that YouTube and Netflix together captured 20% of all US television viewing time in May, with YouTube holding a significant lead at 12.5% compared to Netflix's 7.5%. Their closest streaming rival, Disney, with its combined services (Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+), accounted for 5% of TV time during the same period.Nielsen also suggests contrasting viewership patterns between the two. On average, YouTube attracts 7 million viewers watching via a TV set at any given moment during the day, surpassing Netflix's daily average of 4.7 million. However, the gap narrows during prime-time hours, when TV viewership peaks. During these times, an average of 11.1 million Americans tune into YouTube on their TV screens – slightly ahead of the 10.7 million watching Netflix.YouTube’s dominance in TV viewing continues to grow. It can be attested by the data in the report that two years ago, the Google-owned company’s share of TV time was half a percentage point ahead of Netflix's; now, that lead has widened to five percentage points. Both companies are competing from positions of considerable strength.Moreover, in 2024, Netflix's revenue reached $39 billion, and it boasts over 300 million global subscribers, making it the largest streaming service by subscriber count. The company also demonstrates strong profitability, with over $10 billion in operating income last year.Meanwhile, Google-owned YouTube generated an even larger revenue of $54 billion last year, trailing only Disney among all media companies.Earlier this year, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said that Google 's video streaming giant is increasing its focus on television, announcing that in the US, TVs have surpassed mobile devices as the leading platform for YouTube viewing based on watch time.“Viewers are watching, on average, over 1 billion hours of YouTube content on TVs daily, and TV is now the primary device for YouTube viewing in the US,"" stated Mohan in a blog post. He emphasised that this ""new"" television experience is vastly different from the ""old,"" incorporating interactive elements like Shorts, podcasts, and live streams alongside traditional content such as sports, sitcoms, and talk shows.“We're bringing the best of YouTube to TVs, including a second screen experience that lets you use your phone to interact with the video you're watching on TV — for example, to leave a comment or make a purchase,” he noted.For the past two years, YouTube has consistently held the number one spot in streaming watch time in the US, according to Nielsen.","Nielsen report claims that YouTube and Netflix together captured 20% of all US television viewing time in May.

Boat Nirvana Ivy Pro Review: Flagship audio on a budget

Apple stock analyst Craig Moffett of Moffett Nathanson has reportedly questioned the company’s ability to launch new products under the leadership of CEO Tim Cook. According to a Fortune report, Moffett said “They (Apple) haven't produced a major new product outside of possibly the earbuds in a decade.” “Apple has done far more to innovate process than it has product over Tim Cook's tenure,” he added.“Apple is unprepared for something that transformational,” Moffett said, referring to the next big wave in tech innovation.He acknowledged Cook’s ability to execute business strategies but pointed out that many of Apple’s successes were based on plans made before Cook became CEO.Moffett’s remarks reflect wider concerns among investors about Apple’s future. While Cook has successfully grown Apple into one of the world’s most valuable companies, critics argue the company has not introduced any breakthrough devices in recent years.Last week, analysts at LightShed Partners said that Apple may need a leadership change to better focus on product innovation, especially in the area of artificial intelligence (AI). “To be clear, Tim Cook was the right CEO at the time of his appointment and unquestionably has done a great job,” the analysts wrote in an investors note dated July 9. “Apple has sold over $2.0 trillion of iPhones with Cook as CEO. In fact, iPhone sales could show signs of life this quarter, as tariff-related pull-forwards help stabilize replacement cycles that may finally be bottoming out.”Still, LightShed analysts Walt Piecyk and Joe Galone raised concerns about Apple’s slow progress in AI, warning that the company could fall behind competitors. They highlighted that the efforts to improve Apple’s virtual assistant Siri have not met expectations and that Apple may struggle to deliver a “supercycle” of device upgrades.“AI will reshape industries across the global economy, and Apple risks becoming one of its casualties,” the LightShed analysts commented. The analysts argued that Apple’s position in the AI race could significantly affect its long-term growth.",Apple stock analyst Craig Moffett of Moffett Nathanson has reportedly questioned the company’s ability to launch new products under the leadership of CEO Tim Cook.

"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang: Whenever I get an answer from AI, I always ask …",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-whenever-i-get-an-answer-from-ai-i-always-ask-/articleshow/122503372.cms,"Huang says sometimes he asks AI to treat him as a 12-year-old before answering the question



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has drawn a parallel between his use of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots and how a patient may seek multiple medical opinions. His method provides insight into how to maximise the accuracy of AI chatbot responses, emphasising that he avoids relying on a single AI for answers. Instead, he consults multiple AIs, encouraging them to critique each other’s responses.In a recent interview on CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS”, Huang explained his method: ""When you receive an answer from an AI, I wouldn't just receive it. Usually, what I do is I say, 'Are you sure this is the best answer you can provide?'""“You know this is no different than getting three opinions. Three doctors' opinions. I do the same thing. I ask the same question of multiple AIs. And I ask them to compare each other's notes and then, you know, give me the best of all the answers,” he stated.This isn’t the first time Huang has discussed his personal AI usage. At the 28th annual Milken Institute Global Conference in May, he shared that he uses AI ""as a tutor everyday.""He adapts its explanations to his learning needs, saying, ""In areas that are fairly new to me, I might say, 'Start by explaining it to me like I'm a 12-year-old,' and then work your way up into a doctorate-level over time.""Huang’s insights into his AI habits came in response to a question from Zakaria about AI's potential impact on cognitive skills. Zakaria cited an MIT study that suggested using tools like ChatGPT for writing tasks ""came at a cognitive cost"" to participants.While Huang admitted he hadn't reviewed the MIT research, he firmly believes his ""cognitive skills are actually advancing"" despite using AI ""literally every single day.""He challenged the notion that AI use leads to a decline in critical thinking: ""I'm not exactly sure what people are using it for that would cause you to not have to think, but you have to think.""“When I'm interacting with AI, it's a questioning system. You're asking it questions. In order to formulate good questions, you have to be thinking. You have to be analytical. You have to be reasoning yourself,” he said.Huang isn't alone among tech leaders in integrating AI into daily work. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also revealed in a May Bloomberg interview that he uses Microsoft Copilot for tasks like summarising emails and preparing for meetings.","Jensen Huang says he uses multiple AI chatbots to get the best answers.

How a 3 am email helped Android head Sameer Samat land a job at Google,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-a-3-am-email-helped-android-head-sameer-samat-land-a-job-at-google/articleshow/122502018.cms,"How Google co-founder helped even after rejecting Brin's offer

CEO Sundar Pichai's personal call brought Samat back to Google

Google's head of Android , Sameer Samat , credits a middle-of-the-night cold email to Google cofounder Sergey Brin in 1999 as the pivotal moment that shaped his entire career trajectory. The impromptu message, sent at 3 AM during a heated dispute with his startup cofounders about pursuing graduate school, led to an immediate job offer and long-term mentorship that would eventually bring him to lead one of the world's most influential mobile platforms.""A couple of them were on to go to grad school, and we had a big fight about it,"" Samat told Business Insider. ""I said, 'I don't understand how you can want to go to grad school; we're building this company.'""Samat, then in his early 20s running a machine-learning startup called Mohomine during the dot-com boom, reached out to Brin asking: ""What would you do in this situation? I'm sure you had this wrestle with this grad school decision."" Despite not knowing Brin personally, Samat had studied his research papers and respected Google's work. Remarkably, Brin responded within minutes, inviting Samat to Google's offices for an impromptu interview that same day.Though Samat declined Brin's initial job offer to stay loyal to his cofounders, the Google cofounder went above and beyond to help. ""He didn't have to do any of that,"" Samat told Business Insider. ""And so I try to pay that forward, too, when people call me up with something similar.""Brin advised Samat on securing proper financing and introduced him to investors who eventually funded his startup. According to Business Insider, Samat later sold Mohomine to Kofax , now known as Tungsten Automation , before joining Google in 2008.The experience taught Samat valuable lessons about operating with limited resources as a founder, skills that proved crucial when he eventually joined Google. ""There is no substitute for taking a pretty good plan and just running like hell,"" he explained. He initially led Google Shopping before transitioning to oversee the Android ecosystem.After leaving Google in 2015, Samat received a personal call from newly appointed CEO Sundar Pichai asking him to return. Pichai, whom Samat described as a ""work big brother"" and trusted advisor, specifically requested his help with Android and Google Play.""When he asked if I would come back to work with him on Android and Google Play, it was an easy decision,"" Samat said. ""It was a call that you don't get often in"" your career.Today, Samat advocates for entrepreneurial risk-taking over extensive academic preparation. ""Sometimes the naiveness of someone who doesn't have that background makes a much better entrepreneur,"" he said, noting that the decision to ""do your own thing"" and follow what excites you is most important.","Google's head of Android credits a middle-of-the-night cold email to Google cofounder Sergey Brin as the pivotal moment that shaped his career trajectory.
