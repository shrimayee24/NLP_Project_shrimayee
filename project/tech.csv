Shaunie Henderson and her husband Pastor Keion Henderson explain their successful marriage



Shaquille O'Neal ’s ex, Shaunie Henderson is happily married to Pastor Keion Henderson . The couple, who lead Houston’s Lighthouse Church and Ministries, have built a strong foundation by prioritizing their relationship amidst their busy lives. In a recent chat with Madame Noire, Shaunie, and Keion shared intricate details of their marriage and how they keep their relationship afloat with certain key pointers.As Pastor Keion Henderson explains, managing multiple responsibilities is essential. “We all have to manage multiple things,” he told Madame Noire. “You must manage yourself; if you have a significant other, you must manage that... Everybody has to be multi-faceted.”Outside influences don’t define their marriage. “We recognize that the Internet is not our relationship. The church is not our relationship. People’s opinions, they are not our relationship. We met each other. We chose this journey together and did what we had to stay on the original ship. We don’t let water in the ship,” Keion explains, adding that constant communication and grace are key to their success. Shaunie Henderson values advice from a trusted mentor who told her, “One of the things that I hold dear is that she says not to meet anyone’s expectations. Because once you meet one, there’ll be another one, and there’ll be another one after that, and you will never meet it and just be disappointing yourself and performing.”Defining marriage on their terms is crucial to the Hendersons. “Just because I’m a pastor and just because she’s a First Lady, that doesn’t mean that your faith isn’t tested,” Keion shares. “My definition of marriage is the collision of two histories… And sometimes compatibility isn’t the outcome.” They believe that open communication is essential. “We try to have a designated day that we sit down and talk, but with our life, travel, and schedule, that day and time can change,” Shaunie added.Knowing when to step away is another lesson they’ve learned in their marriage. “Our approach has been twofold. No. 1, communicate. No. 2, step away,” Keion reveals. “We’ll give each other some time to think about it and then come and talk.” Keion, author of Lazy Love: Recognizing and Reversing the 4 Threats to Any Successful Relationship, explains, “As I understand you, you understand me. I trust the outcomes that we both come away with… We always come together stronger than ever.”Faith remains the core of their union. “It is a must,” Shaunie asserts. “As women, we need to feel safe, and once you feel safe, you’re OK with being vulnerable… Having a spiritual component in your marriage is another layer of safety.” Keion adds that faith offers reassurance, saying, “I want folks to feel like they are overcomers… that they can manage their children and their businesses and their relationships.”Also Read: ""It's less physical"": Shaquille O'Neal weighs in on LeBron James' career amid injury controversy Shaunie was previously married to NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal.

"'No tip, no ride’: Bengaluru commuters slam auto apps over unfair tipping system, say 'drivers also demand more money at drop points'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/no-tip-no-ride-bengaluru-commuters-slam-auto-apps-over-unfair-tipping-system-say-drivers-also-demand-more-money-at-drop-points/articleshow/119687089.cms,"BENGALURU: Passengers using app-based autos are voicing their frustration, claiming they end up paying as much as they would have if they hailed the vehicle on the road. During peak hours, drivers accept bookings only if customers add a tip ranging from Rs 10 to Rs 80, they say. Besides, some drivers allegedly demand additional money at drop points.Mobile apps display messages: 'Adding a tip might help increase the chances of getting a ride faster', 'Now you can set a price that works for you', 'Add a tip for faster pick up', 'A driver may be more likely to accept this ride if you add a tip', 'Your driver receives 100% of the tip. If you add a tip now, you can't change it later', and 'High demand, selected tip helps you find a ride faster'. Passengers say the aggregators appear to be hand in glove with what seems to be a new mode of surge pricing.Niharika B, a passenger, said, ""When I tried to book a cab from Residency Road to Bellandur, the app displayed a fare of Rs 296, which was close to Rs 20 per km. I tried booking without tip but was unable to find an auto despite multiple attempts. It was only after I agreed to pay a tip of Rs 50 that an auto driver accepted the booking. This is happening routinely.""Sushmitha Harish, another passenger, said the auto fare from her home at Ramamurthy Nagar to Byappanahalli Metro station back gate is Rs 75. ""The mobile app I often use charges me Rs 90-100 for it every time. Since last week, I noticed a hike. It charges Rs 110-120. If it charges one-and-a-half or even double, why do I need the help of an app? I might as well bargain with an auto driver myself. It will turn out to be cheaper than going through these apps. Now that the auto fares are going to be revised, booking through apps will become totally unaffordable. The apps were once saviours for us. They became a hit because they understood the pain of a daily commuter and gave a solution to this. Now, they have become bigger fleecers than the auto drivers themselves,"" she said.According to Sushmitha, booking bike taxis using apps is also becoming expensive. ""There are multiple instances of bike taxis accepting bookings only after riders agree to pay a tip that ranges from Rs 10 to Rs 40,"" she said.Another passenger, Navneeth J, said, ""Usually, I book an auto from JP Nagar Metro station to Bannerghatta Road. During peak hours, it is difficult to get an auto without paying a tip. There were several instances of auto drivers demanding more money, citing heavy traffic on Outer Ring Road. The app displays a message that 100% of the fare charged goes to auto drivers, but drivers dispute the claims of aggregators.""Shriman Sharma, a techie from Bellandur, said, ""During peak hours, until I add a tip, I do not get a ride. There are days when the fare would be hiked, and they would be asking you for a tip.""Asked about the legality of tips being charged to book an auto, transport commissioner Yogesh AM said, ""The transport department has no say in tipping the drivers while booking autos using a mobile app."" He said the department is contemplating bringing autos under mobile app-based aggregators' rules.","Mobile apps display messages: 'Adding a tip might help increase the chances of getting a ride faster', 'Add a tip for faster pick up', 'A driver may be more likely to accept this ride if you add a tip', 'Your driver receives 100% of the tip' Passengers say the aggregators appear to be hand in glove with a new mode of surge pricing.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119687134,imgsize-100780,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/119687134.jpg"

Film buff Lewis Hamilton teases exciting movie project alongside Charles Leclerc



Lewis & Charles Reveal Their Biggest Inspirations

Lewis Hamilton has never been one to shy away from the spotlight, whether it's on the Formula 1 track or in the world of entertainment. His passion for film recently took center stage when he recreated an iconic scene from Ferris Bueller’s Day Off. The video, which he shared on his new TikTok account, quickly gained traction, amassing an impressive more than 10 million views. And now, it seems Hamilton is just getting started.Lewis Hamilton's admiration for cinema dates back to his early years, with one particular movie playing a crucial role in shaping his love for Ferrari. ""I love movies. I love film,"" he shared in a recent YouTube video for Ferrari’s Formula 1 team. Ferris Bueller’s Day Off was his first glimpse of a Ferrari, an experience that left a lasting mark. ""Ferris Bueller was actually the first time I saw a Ferrari - I must've been five or six.""The car in question—the legendary 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder—was a vehicle that ignited his passion for speed. His fascination with racing took root early, and by the age of eight, he was already laying the foundation for his illustrious F1 career.The idea to recreate the famous Ferris Bueller scene had been brewing in Hamilton’s mind for quite some time. ""About a year and a half - maybe two years ago - I started a production company. Me and my friend Timmy were sitting around, just talking, and we started talking about Ferris Bueller. I said, 'How sick would it be if we could reshoot that scene where they're driving the Ferrari over the hill and landing to the Star Wars music?' That idea just never left my mind after I envisioned it.""Through his own production company, Dawn Apollo Films, Hamilton was able to bring his vision to life. The recreation wasn't just about paying tribute to the classic film—it was a project driven by passion, creativity, and meticulous attention to detail. Not only did the video feature cutting-edge technology and high production value, but it also included acclaimed actor Edward Norton alongside Hamilton.""It definitely took a lot of cutting-edge tech, production and planning to get right,"" he admitted on social media. The most critical element, however, was securing the exact car. ""Had to get the exact car too... it's been a dream car since seeing the movie,"" he revealed.With his passion for storytelling flourishing, Hamilton has no plans to stop. Being deeply involved in the upcoming F1 film, he has fully embraced his creative side. And now, he’s already thinking about his next project. ""The next kind of film clip that I'm looking to do is something from an Eddie Murphy movie.""His new Ferrari teammate, Charles Leclerc , who appeared alongside Hamilton in a recent video, was asked what film he’d like to be part of. His answer? Harry Potter—a fitting choice, given that he was once told he resembled the famous wizard. Hamilton wasted no time in brainstorming. ""Maybe I'll do your Harry Potter one first. Maybe I'll do the Harry Potter thing with you!""Also Read: What actually happened to F1 legend Michael Schumacher on December 29, 2013, that completely changed his life? Away from the cameras, both drivers have an important task ahead—the Japanese Grand Prix . After their disqualification in China, Hamilton and Leclerc are eager for a smooth, incident-free race weekend. With crucial championship points on the line, they’ll be looking to make an impact at Suzuka, both on the track and in their growing off-track ventures.","Lewis Hamilton recently recreated a scene from Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.

If you’ve been scrolling through social media lately --be it Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok -- you would have surely noticed the Ghibli-style photo trend taking over feeds everywhere. Those dreamy, pastel-hued images of whimsical forests, wide-eyed characters, and soft golden light straight out of a Studio Ghibli film have gone viral, racking up likes, shares, and endless “how did they do that?” comments. It's been almost a week, and this aesthetic obsession shows no signs of slowing down, with creators using AI tools, hand-drawn art, and photo edits to channel the magic of My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited Away. But why stop at static photos? Let’s ride this wave and turn your Ghibli-style masterpieces into an animation video that’ll have your followers hitting “replay.” Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create a short animation video inspired by the iconic Studio Ghibli aesthetic:The viral buzz started with fans and creators posting Ghibli-inspired snapshots—think lush landscapes and soulful characters, often AI-generated with tools like Midjourney or hand-drawn by digital artists. To join in, you’ll need your own photos ready.Grab or Create Your Images: If you’ve already posted a viral Ghibli-style pic, use that! Otherwise, whip one up with a prompt like “Studio Ghibli-style sunset village, soft colors, detailed” in an AI tool, or sketch it yourself in Procreate.Layer Like a Pro: Split your photo into parts—characters, trees, sky—for animation flexibility. Social media loves those multi-depth shots, and it’s perfect for what’s next.Ghibli’s charm lies in its quiet, heartfelt storytelling, and your animation can capture that—even in a 15-second clip that’s perfect for TikTok’s algorithm.Quick Sketch: Plan a mini-sequence. Maybe your character walks through a glowing forest, or a breeze scatters cherry blossoms. Keep it simple but enchanting—social media thrives on “ooh” moments.Frame Rate Flex: Go for 24 FPS (Ghibli’s cinematic sweet spot). A 10-second viral hit needs 240 frames, but don’t sweat it—software will fill the gaps.To animate Ghibli-style illustrations, you’ll need software that supports frame-by-frame animation, layering, and smooth transitions. Some of the best options include:Adobe After Effects : Ideal for advanced users, offering powerful animation tools and visual effects.Blender: A free, open-source 3D software that allows for detailed animation and rendering.Procreate Dreams: Huge on iPad-toting artists in this trend—hand-draw frames for that authentic Ghibli feel.RunwayML: AI fans love this for interpolating motion between images, cutting down work while keeping it share-worthy.CapCut: Free, fast, and TikTok-friendly for quick edits if you’re new to this.Once you’ve selected your software:Import all your Ghibli-style images into the software.Organize assets by layers (backgrounds, midgrounds, and foregrounds).Group character movements or effects into separate layers for better control.To create smooth animations:Keyframe Animation: Set keyframes at major points to define object positions and movements.Tweening: Fill in the frames between keyframes to achieve smooth transitions.Parallax Effect: Create depth by animating foreground and background layers independently.Studio Ghibli’s charm lies in its attention to environmental details. To replicate this:Add Particle Effects: Animate rain, leaves, or fireflies to create a magical ambiance.Adjust Lighting and Shadows: Use soft, dynamic lighting to evoke different moods.Simulate Camera Movements: Incorporate slow pans, zooms, and tracking shots for a cinematic effect.No Ghibli-inspired animation is complete without a captivating soundtrack.Background Score: Choose soothing, orchestral music that evokes nostalgia and wonder.Ambient Sounds: Add subtle environmental sounds (rustling leaves, chirping birds) for realism.Dialogue and Foley: Sync character speech and sound effects to the animation timeline.After perfecting your animation:Choose the appropriate export settings for your platform.Ensure a high-resolution export (1080p or 4K) for crisp visuals.Test your video for any frame drops or inconsistencies before finalizing.Users must be mindful of copyright restrictions when using AI-generated images, especially for commercial purposes as using copyrighted images as input could raise legal issues.","The Ghibli-style photo trend is taking over social media.

The Seestar S30 is highly recommended for eclipse photography due to its built-in solar tracking and smartphone compatibility.

2. Install the telescope’s companion App

Each smart telescope has a dedicated app that allows full control. Download the Seestar App from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.

3. Connect your smartphone to the telescope

Power on the telescope and place it on a stable surface.

Open your phone’s WiFi settings and connect to the telescope’s network.

Launch the Seestar App and follow on-screen instructions for calibration.

4. Attach a solar filter for safe viewing

To protect both the telescope and your eyes, attach a solar filter over the lens. The Seestar S30 includes a built-in solar filter specifically for capturing the sun.

5. Select the cclipse as your imaging target

Open the Seestar App and switch to Solar Mode.

The telescope will automatically locate and track the sun.

Adjust exposure, brightness, and focus settings for optimal image clarity.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.
