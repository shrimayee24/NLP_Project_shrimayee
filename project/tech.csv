The pink is due to a genetic mutation.""With infectious enthusiasm, Jamie explains the rarity of this encounter, noting that only 1% of people may have the chance to witness such a phenomenon in their lifetime.She goes on to reveal the scientific reason behind the grasshopper's unique coloration, attributing it to a genetic mutation that causes an overproduction of pink pigment and an underproduction of black.''Wow, I just found a pink grasshopper. There's like 1% of people can see pink grasshoppers in their lifetime. So, I am so lucky to be able to see it. Pink grasshoppers, the reason why they are pink is because of their genetic aberration, which means they produce too much pink pigment and not enough black.

Gilded Youth: An Intimate History of Growing Up in the

Royal Family

OK!

Kate Middleton , the Princess of Wales, has become known not only for her grace in public but also for her remarkably effective parenting style. As Prince George , Princess Charlotte , and Prince Louis grow older and attend more public events, royal watchers have noted their impeccable behavior.However, when things do go awry, Kate uses a unique method to keep her children disciplined, often employing a simple but effective phrase:In his book, royal expert Tom Quinn shed light on how the princess manages moments of mischief, such as when Prince Louis made headlines during the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee.During the event, Louis was seen sticking his tongue out at his mother, but rather than reacting harshly, Kate calmly used her signature phrase. According to Quinn, while seemingly harmless, these four words carry significant weight in the royal household. The children, understanding the cue, quickly fall back in line.Former staffers have praised Kate’s calm demeanour, noting that she prefers to let her children enjoy being kids and doesn’t overly stress about minor misbehavior. A source toldthat Kate ""doesn’t worry too much"" about her children’s behaviour and ""loves seeing them being kids."" Prince Louis, in particular, is described as an energetic child who occasionally struggles to contain his excitement during public engagements. However, his cheeky antics have often been met with humor by his parents, who even acknowledged them in a light-hearted thank-you note after the Jubilee.In contrast to more traditional approaches, the Prince and Princess of Wales prioritize open dialogue and a calm atmosphere at home. When one of their children experiences strong emotions or acts out, the royal couple opts for a ""sofa chat"" rather than isolating the child. This approach allows the children to process their feelings with guidance, rather than leaving them to manage their emotions alone. Notably, the couple adheres to a strict ""no shouting"" policy, ensuring a calm and nurturing environment even when discipline is necessary.William and Kate’s modern parenting methods, which blend discipline with empathy, continue to draw praise from experts and royal fans alike, reinforcing their image as dedicated and thoughtful parents.","Kate Middleton's signature phrase is: ""let's take a break"" royal expert Tom Quinn shed light on how the princess manages moments of mischief.

Lake Michigan Discovery: Scientists investigate mysterious formations beneath lake Michigan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/craters-or-sinkholes-scientists-investigate-mysterious-formations-beneath-lake-michigan/articleshow/113837760.cms,"Representative Image (Picture credit: X/@ChiPhotoGuy)

Scientists made a remarkable discovery beneath the surface of Lake Michigan using sonar technology .As per LiveScience, strange circles were detected at the lakebed, and new research is now providing insights into these intriguing formations.The mysterious shapes were initially found during a mission to map the lakebed within the Wisconsin Shipwreck Coast National Marine Sanctuary, an area known for its numerous shipwrecks.Maritime archaeologist and sanctuary superintendent Russ Green described the discovery as particularly exciting, saying, ""Any kind of new discovery in the Great Lakes is exciting, but these features really stand out.""It wasn't until a joint survey in August 2024 that researchers, including Green and his colleagues from NOAA 's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL), confirmed the shapes to be enormous craters at the lakebed. Using a remotely operated vehicle, they surveyed the site southeast of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, and discovered approximately 40 craters, with diameters ranging from 500 to 1,000 feet.Local shipwreck hunter Brendon Baillod had also noticed these formations while searching for a sunken freighter. He described the depressions as irregularly shaped craters, some between 20 to 40 feet deep, and suggested that trapped gas or water upwelling might be responsible for their formation rather than sinkholes .Kevin Cullen, the Director of the Wisconsin Maritime Museum , expressed his curiosity about the craters, highlighting thegeological mystery . With only a small portion of Lake Michigan's floor explored, Cullen proposed that the formations could be connected to underwater gorges created by glaciers centuries ago.Geologists have noted that the craters could be sinkholes, as Lake Michigan partially sits on limestone, a rock type susceptible to dissolution and cavity formation. However, recent surveys found no water escaping from the holes, which would indicate groundwater movement. Experts like Steve Ruberg from GLERL believe it's only a matter of time before they detect signs of water circulation beneath the lakebed.During the survey, images and videos captured life thriving in the deep craters, including freshwater shrimp, small fish, and invasive quagga mussels. Researchers are now focused on understanding the role these craters play in Lake Michigan's ecosystem and how they might impact the lake as a whole.While much has been uncovered about these formations, many questions remain unanswered. Researchers like Russ Green are excited about what future investigations will reveal, stating, ""We'll be exploring them for years to come to learn more, and sort out how they got there and what role they play in Lake Michigan's ecosystem."" For now, the massive craters remain one of the Great Lakes' most intriguing geological mysteries, with more secrets likely to emerge as further research continues.","Scientists made a remarkable discovery beneath the surface of Lake Michigan using sonar technology.

Tech billionaire Elon Musk has once again stirred up controversy by criticising California's recent legislation that prohibits local governments from mandating voter ID requirements. Following governor Gavin Newsom 's signing of the bill into law, Musk took to X (formerly Twitter) to voice his disapproval.The new law prevents local authorities from requiring residents to present valid identification in order to cast their vote.In his post, he expressed his concerns about election security and voter fraud, stating, ""Wow, it is now illegal to require voter ID in California! They just made preventing voter fraud against the law. The Joker is in charge.""His comment quickly generated a flurry of responses, with some supporting his viewpoint while others criticized his stance.Users shared their apprehensions about the new legislation. One user wrote, ""Democrats don't even hide stealing elections anymore,"" while another questioned, ""If you need a driver's license to drive a car, why wouldn't you need an ID to vote in an election?""In support of Musk's position, a user commented, ""The only reason. The only reason that you would ban voter ID is because you want to cheat. Period"".However, another user countered this argument, saying, ""Nah. New Zealand doesn't require voter identification to vote or to enroll. It's not ""to cheat"". It's to make voting as accessible as possible. If you call ""allowing everyone who is legally able to vote, to vote as easily as they can"" a form of 'cheating', well…"".Some users resorted to sarcasm and humour to address the situation. One user quipped, ""Things that are illegal in California: Voter ID, Memes, Common sense,"" while another jokingly asked, ""So we can vote, fly to California & vote again?""Musk, who has publicly endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in the upcoming election, is renowned for his candid opinions on various social and political matters.California governor Gavin Newsom enacted a new law that prohibits local authorities from mandating voters to show identification when casting their ballots.

Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Take a look at the post here



Pokemon Scarlet and Violet players may face a new fiery challenge in early October as Infernape, the popular fourth-generation Fire-type starter, takes over Seven-Star Tera Raid dens. Infernape is a significantly tougher opponent than the previous Serperior. It is known for its high speed and powerful attacks and will reportedly replace Serperior the Unrivaled as the next formidable Tera Raid boss.While possessing a versatile move set and impressive offensive stats, trainers should be wary of its low HP and susceptibility to Water, Flying, and Ground-type attacks.According to a report by Serebii.net, the fighting against Infernape the Unrivaled will commence on Thursday, October 3 at 8:00 pm EST (5.30 am IST) and continue until Sunday, October 6 at 7:59 pm EST (5.29 IST). A second opportunity to face this challenging foe will be available the following week, from October 10 to 13 at the same time.In a post on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Serebii.net shares all the details.Players can acquire Infernape in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet by catching a Chimchar in the Terarium's Polar Biome and evolving it. Prepare your teams and strategies to face this challenging opponent in the upcoming Tera Raids. The Infernape will boast the Rock-type as its Tera type and will reward successful trainers with the coveted Mightiest Mark.Just like previous Tera Raid bosses, Infernape the Unrivaled, will possess its Hidden Ability,Iron Fist , which will significantly amplify the power of its punching moves. Therefore, trainers should anticipate facing attacks like Mach Punch, Fire Punch, and Thunder Punch.Additionally, Infernape will utilise its Rock Tera type with moves such as Stone Edge or Rock Slide, potentially combining them with disruptive tactics like Taunt and Swords Dance. Despite the defensive nature of Rock-type Pokemon, Infernape's inherent fragility leaves it open to attacks from Water, Ground, and Fighting types.Trainers are advised to prepare their teams and strategies carefully to overcome this formidable opponent. Also, trainers preparing to challenge Infernape the Unrivaled should prioritise building teams with strong defences to withstand its powerful punches.","Pokemon Scarlet and Violet players may face a new fiery challenge in early October.

A Bengaluru resident has exposed a delivery scam attempt. This scam involved a fake Flipkart delivery man who tried to deliver a fake package disguised as an iPhone 15. The resident, who had ordered an iPhone 15 with 256GB storage and opted for an open-box delivery , claims that a man dressed in a white t-shirt posed as a Flipkart delivery executive and attempted to hand over a sealed package.To prevent customers from receiving damaged or incorrect items, online retailers like Amazon and Flipkart often offer an ""open-box delivery"" option for high-value purchases. This allows customers to inspect the product before accepting the delivery, ensuring they receive exactly what they ordered. The imposter reportedly pressured the resident to accept the package without inspection, but fled the scene when the resident started recording the interaction.In the post, he wrote: “My sister bought an iPhone 15 with VIP on the Flipkart sale, it was an open box delivery. This loser (a guy in white) came with a big package to deliver claiming that he couldn't do an ‘open box delivery’. We have to accept it as is. I refused. He called some random people and they said there was no facility like that. He was scared shitless because I recorded all this. Telling his partners in crime in Kannada that I have recorded everything and all. I did not accept the package. Within two minutes another guy came to deliver a very small package and said that he would open the box before delivering it. We got the product because I recorded everything, otherwise I am sure he would have given me some random package.”At the end of the post also shared the pictures of the delivery executives . Here’s is the one who the customer flagged as a fake one:How users reacted to this postThe Reddit post got a lot of significant attention as it sparked a wave of users sharing similar concerns about trustworthiness and scams on online marketplaces . Many recounted their own experiences of receiving damaged, incorrect, or even empty packages despite opting for open-box deliveries.In the comments section, one user wrote: “Nice bro. Glad you knew something was off and recorded everything. It's very hard to trust Flipkart now. Their association with an insane amount of scammers in all delivery pipelines is really scary. It's really disturbing you know that Flipkart can't do or doesn't do anything about the scamming happening during the delivery.”Meanwhile, another user noted: “Just yesterday I received a laptop. Did an open box check, and even waited for the initial irritating Windows setup and upgrade to complete, to check that the processor and other details are as expected.In the past, Amazon sent me a laptop with a gen 4 i5 processor, instead of a gen 8, that I had ordered. And my stupid ass realised it after a year, when I ran some benchmarks.The Flipkart guy was obviously in a hurry, as I was clearly taking more time than I should have. (In my defence, I couldn't accept a 90k laptop, without being sure that it was the correct one)I finally have him 200 rupees, and then he was more than happy to wait for 45 minutes. He went ahead and made 2-3 more deliveries, then came back and took the OTP from me.I made a 40 minute long video, from the moment on unboxing, till verifying everything.The only reason I order costlier items from Flipkart and not Amazon, is for open box deliveries. If they do any drama in that, they can take it back.”",A Bengaluru resident has exposed a delivery scam attempt. This scam involved a fake Flipkart delivery man who tried to deliver a fake package disguised as an iPhone 15.
