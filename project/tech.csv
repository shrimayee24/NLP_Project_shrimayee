Claims of AI-made apology fuel new backlash against Kayla Nicole





More NFL coverage





Kayla Nicole seems to never escape the storm that follows her name online. The former longtime girlfriend of Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce is once again pulled into a new wave of backlash, and this time the conversation is not only about what she said years ago. It is also about how she chose to respond now. What began as a resurfacing of decade-old tweets has turned into a much louder debate about authenticity, accountability, and the growing suspicion around the use of artificial intelligence in public apologies.The SportsRush reported that some online users accused Nicole of using ChatGPT or another AI tool to craft her apology for her old offensive tweets. That accusation has created a second controversy, with people now questioning whether her regret was genuine or written by a machine.The situation first ignited when users dug up tweets Kayla Nicole posted between 2010 and 2014, long before she became a public figure. Those posts contained racial remarks, homophobic language, and stereotypes aimed at Asian and Indian communities. As screenshots began circulating at high speed across social media, Nicole took down her X account and later addressed the issue on Instagram. In her statement, she wrote that she was ""ashamed"" of her past language and stressed that her current beliefs ""are rooted in love, respect, and empathy.Her apology was expected to settle the matter, but instead it sparked more frustration. Some users copied her message into online AI-detection tools, which labeled it as “100% AI-generated.” According to The SportsRush, this result encouraged critics to argue that Nicole relied on ChatGPT to form her apology. The allegation quickly became louder than the apology itself as many claimed the tone felt calculated rather than heartfelt.For some people, the possibility of an AI-written apology suggested that she did not hold true remorse. They viewed it as an attempt to escape accountability through polished language.Others pushed back, saying that AI accusations felt like an unnecessary distraction. They argued that using detection tools to delegitimize her apology only added noise to an already tense situation. Instead, they believe that the focus should remain on acknowledging harm, understanding growth, and recognizing that, people can evolve from the mistakes they made in their past.",Travis Kelce’s ex faces new scrutiny as fans claim her heartfelt apology shows signs of AI-generated scripting.

Stable Ronaldo says Poggers drama gets ignored while FaZe faces harsh labels,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/stable-ronaldo-says-poggers-drama-gets-ignored-while-faze-faces-harsh-labels/articleshow/125370213.cms,"Image Via Instagram

“n*zi,”

“ableist”

“problematic,”

“ret*rd”

Stable Ronaldo questions why Poggers issues receive less scrutiny than FaZe claims

“serious”





In a new viral clip circulating across X and TikTok reposts, streamer Stable Ronaldo has sparked heated discussion by calling out what he sees as a glaring double standard in how drama is treated between the Poggers community and FaZe. In the video, he argues that far more serious allegations appear in Poggers-related controversies, ranging from accusations of hitting women to SA and animal abuse, yet social media timelines consistently reserve harsher judgment for FaZe members. He points to the sudden spike in posts labeling FaZe creator Lacy aand questions how such extreme accusations gain traction so quickly while seemingly bigger issues get buried.Ronaldo’s comments also touch on the broader climate of discourse around FaZe Clan, where he says the group is constantly hit with labels likeandregardless of context or evidence. Expressing visible frustration, he claims the criticism often becomes exaggerated or misinformed, creating a narrative loop that social media keeps amplifying. During the rant, Ronaldo makes a controversial remark about having ADHD and therefore being allowed to use the slur, a line that has drawn its own backlash and reignited debates on ableist language, streamer accountability, and the responsibility creators hold when addressing sensitive topics in public.At the center of Ronaldo’s argument is his belief that social platforms apply uneven standards depending on which community is involved. He cites Poggers drama involving severe accusations but notes that the timeline instead becomes dominated by criticism toward FaZe, often using extreme or inflammatory labels. According to Ronaldo, this imbalance creates a distorted picture: believable or documented allegations linked to Poggers streamers fade quickly, while unverified or exaggerated claims against FaZe trend longer and louder. His comments reflect growing tensions between two of the internet’s most recognizable streamer spheres, each with its own distinct culture, audience dynamics, and standards for what qualifies asdrama.Stable Ronaldo’s clip has intensified ongoing discussions about selective outrage, accountability, and fairness in online communities. While his defense of FaZe resonates with some fans, his controversial language has amplified criticism from others.

Understanding the science behind the Northern Lights





How geomagnetic storms are classified





Tips to improve your chances of seeing the Northern Lights





Find a dark viewing spot far from city lights and face north for the best view. Light pollution can wash out faint auroras, so rural or elevated areas are ideal.

Use your smartphone camera as many modern phone cameras are more sensitive to light than the human eye and can detect faint auroras before they become visible.

Let your eyes adjust to the dark for at least 20 to 30 minutes and avoid looking at bright screens. This allows your vision to adapt to low light and makes it easier to spot subtle colour shifts in the sky.

Dress warmly because temperatures can drop significantly at night, especially in northern regions. Layered clothing, gloves, and hats are essential for comfort during long viewing periods.

Be patient. The Northern Lights are unpredictable and can appear suddenly. Staying outdoors for an extended period improves your chances of witnessing the spectacle.

What to do if you miss tonight’s display

The night sky across the United States is expected to dazzle millions as the Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, become visible in over twenty states from November 11 to 12, 2025. This rare spectacle is fueled by heightened solar activity, including several powerful solar eruptions that send charged particles hurtling toward Earth at incredible speeds. As these particles interact with the planet’s magnetic field, they create stunning displays of shifting light in shades of green, pink, and violet, dancing across the sky in dynamic, ever-changing patterns. The phenomenon, usually confined to polar regions, may reach as far south as states like Kansas and Virginia, offering a rare opportunity for Americans to witness one of nature’s most captivating and colourful celestial events.The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, are expected to dazzle skywatchers across the United States tonight, offering a rare opportunity for millions to witness one of nature’s most mesmerising displays. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), enhanced solar activity has created ideal conditions for auroral visibility, pushing the colourful phenomenon much farther south than usual.If weather conditions remain clear, shimmering curtains of green, pink, and violet light could illuminate the skies across multiple regions, from the Pacific Northwest to the Northeast. This widespread coverage marks one of the most extensive Northern Lights forecasts in recent years, making tonight a particularly exciting occasion for stargazers and photographers alike.Here’s the list of US states:Timing is crucial for observing the aurora borealis. NOAA’s three-day geomagnetic forecast predicts that activity will peak late in the evening and continue into the early hours of 12 November. The best viewing windows are expected to be between 4 pm and 10 pm EST (2100–0300 GMT) for minor to moderate activity, and between 10 pm and 1 am EST (0300–0600 GMT) for stronger geomagnetic storm levels.During these peak hours, observers may witness luminous arcs or shimmering curtains of light dancing across the northern horizon. In some areas, the lights could stretch overhead in glowing ribbons that shift and ripple as magnetic fields interact.The combination of multiple CMEs and an exceptionally powerful solar flare makes this event stand out from recent auroral displays. The convergence of these solar bursts increases the likelihood of intense geomagnetic disturbances. Such interactions can create stacked auroras, where layers of colour overlap, giving the sky an even richer appearance. The last time auroras of this strength reached similar latitudes was during strong solar events several years ago. Additionally, solar activity tends to rise and fall in roughly 11-year cycles known as solar cycles. We are currently nearing the peak of Solar Cycle 25, which explains the recent increase in both sunspots and flares that are the main drivers of auroral events, producing spectacular skies visible to many observers across high-latitude regions.The Northern Lights occur when streams of charged particles from the Sun, known as the solar wind, reach Earth and interact with gases in the upper atmosphere. These collisions release energy in the form of light, producing the stunning patterns that dance across the sky.Oxygen atoms are responsible for the green and red colours most commonly seen, while nitrogen produces blue and purple hues. The exact colours depend on which gases are hit and at what altitude the interactions take place.This week’s event is particularly special because several coronal mass ejections (CMEs), enormous bursts of plasma and magnetic energy from the Sun, are headed toward Earth. These CMEs are part of heightened solar activity linked to an X5.1-class solar flare, the most powerful flare recorded so far in 2025. When these charged particles collide with Earth’s magnetic field, they can cause strong geomagnetic storms, expanding the auroral oval and pushing the Northern Lights much farther south than usual.Geomagnetic storms are measured on a five-level scale from G1 (minor) to G5 (extreme). These classifications are determined by the strength of the disturbance in Earth’s magnetic field.A G3 storm is strong enough to make auroras visible at mid-latitudes, while a G4 storm can extend the visibility range even farther south and may affect some radio communications and satellite operations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued a G4 geomagnetic storm watch, suggesting that much of the continental United States could witness the aurora. It is rare for auroras to reach such southern latitudes, making this a potentially historic event for skywatchers.While space weather determines when the aurora will occur, your viewing experience depends largely on preparation and local conditions. Experts recommend several strategies to increase your odds of seeing the lights clearly.If cloudy skies or poor visibility spoil your view tonight, there is still hope. The sequence of solar eruptions means geomagnetic activity could remain elevated for several days. Keep an eye on forecast updates through NOAA’s channels or dedicated aurora-tracking apps, as new opportunities may arise later this week.Even if you miss this particular show, solar activity is expected to stay strong for the remainder of the year, providing additional chances for aurora sightings across mid-latitudes.","The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, are expected to dazzle skywatchers across the United States tonight.

“Tommy just lost 50% of his supporters with this one move!”

“Nick Fuentes defends extremism abroad while aiming at the wrong targets at home.”

“People are saying the timing of his Israel trip explains everything — and it’s no coincidence.”

“Fuentes is a Qatari-backed spy-op sent to split the movement — wake up!”

“Shouldn’t you be focusing on England instead of picking fights online?”

“He’s part of the very system he claims to fight against.”

“Fuentes has answered the January 6 question countless times — stop trying to paint him as a fed.”

“America has no idea how Islamic communities operate — Tommy needs to get on US podcasts and explain it.”

“Fuentes has no clue what it’s like living near Islamic neighbourhoods — he’s speaking from a bubble.”

“Your constant alignment with Israel is hurting your own cause — this isn’t helping you.”





A new online dispute has broken out between Tommy Robinson and American commentator Nick Fuentes, after Fuentes referred to Robinson as a “Zionist tool” in a circulating clip.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





MUNICH: OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT violated German copyright laws by reproducing lyrics from songs by best-selling musician Herbert Groenemeyer and others, a court ruled on Tuesday, in a closely watched case against the firm over its use of lyrics to train its language models. The regional court found that the company trained its AI on protected content from nine German songs, including Groenemeyer’s hits “Maenner” and “Bochum”. The case was brought by German music rights society GEMA.Presiding judge Elke Schwager ordered OpenAI to pay damages for the use of copyrighted material, without disclosing a figure.OpenAI had argued that its language models did not store or copy specific training data but, rather, reflected what they had learned based on the entire training data set.Since the output would only be generated as a result of user inputs known as prompts, it was not the defendants, but the users who would be liable, OpenAI had argued. However, the court found that both the memorisation in the language models and the reproduction of the song lyrics in the chatbot’s outputs constitute infringements of copyright exploitation right.“We disagree with the ruling and are considering next steps,” a spokesperson for OpenAI said. “The decision is for a limited set of lyrics and does not impact the millions of people who use our technology every day.”REUTERS",German court rules OpenAI violated copyright laws by reproducing lyrics from songs by best-selling musician Herbert Groenemeyer and others.

Tower’s spectacular features





Dubai developer Danube Group has launched Shahrukhz by Danube, a premium commercial tower on Sheikh Zayed Road that will carry Shah Rukh Khan ’s name and a life-size statue of the star at its entrance. The project, unveiled at a Mumbai event with Danube founder Rizwan Sajan and Shah Rukh Khan, is positioned as a landmark commercial address and is expected to be completed in the next 3–4 years.Shahrukhz (styled as Shahrukhz by Danube) is being promoted as a premium commercial and lifestyle tower on Sheikh Zayed Road, Dubai’s main business artery. Reports list it as a 55–56 storey development with more than one million sq ft of built-up space, a helipad, over 40 amenities (sky pool, business lounges, valet, etc.), and a life-size statue of Shah Rukh Khan in his signature open-arms pose at the entrance. The builder's marketing and press coverage place the finish date around 2029, a roughly three-to-four-year timeline.The newly unveiled skyscraper is more than just a name; it’s a massive commercial development positioned at a prime location. The building sits directly on Sheikh Zayed Road, Dubai's main arterial corridor. The project carries a gross saleable value of approximately ₹4,000 crore (over $480 million) and will span more than 1 million square feet of built-up space.Marketed as a premium, Grade-A commercial destination, the tower stands 55 or 56 storeys tall.This landmark development is intended to be affordable for new businesses in Dubai, with commercial units starting at around $460,000. Construction is underway, and the developers are targeting a completion date by the second quarter of 2029.Danube Group is one of the UAE’s most recognisable home-grown business success stories, and the company behind the newly announced Shahrukhz tower. The group was founded in 1993 by Rizwan Sajan, an Indian-origin entrepreneur who arrived in Dubai with modest beginnings and grew a small trading shop into a multi-industry powerhouse.Over three decades, Sajan expanded Danube from a building-materials supplier into a diversified conglomerate with operations across the Middle East and Asia. His leadership style is often described as hands-on, ambitious and deeply relationship-driven, which has helped Danube build long-standing trust among suppliers, customers and partners.Today, Danube Group operates several major verticals, including building materials, home interiors, hospitality, façade systems and real estate but its most high-profile public face is Danube Properties, the development arm behind this new Shah Rukh Khan-named tower. Because the company originally started in building materials, Danube has an unusually deep supply-chain advantage in construction, allowing it to manage cost, quality and delivery with tighter control than many competitors.The grand launch event took place not in Dubai, but in Mumbai, hosted by the developers to appeal to Indian investors. Superstar Shah Rukh Khan graced the stage, alongside Danube Chairman Rizwan Sajan and filmmaker Farah Khan. The actor became visibly emotional while reflecting on the milestone, noting that his late mother would have been ""very happy"" about the honour. He shared a personal connection, expressing pride that he could tell his children, ""Papa's name is written here, this is Papa's building. ""In classic SRK style, he entertained the audience by recreating his iconic open-arm pose, performing the ""Don walk,"" and delivering his famous 'Om Shanti Om' dialogue. He also joked about his rare public appearances, quipping, ""I’ve become like the Eid moon. I am rarely seen, but when I appear, I look good."" Khan revealed that he was drawn to the project because it resonated with the idea of supporting people who come to a city with dreams of building their businesses and lives.The ""Shahrukhz by Danube"" tower is designed to be a unique experience, blending luxury commercial space with a tourist attraction dedicated to the star. It will boast more than 40 premium amenities for its occupants. The most distinctive feature will be a life-size statue of Shah Rukh Khan in his signature open-arms pose, located prominently at the entrance.The developers envision this entrance becoming a must-visit tourist destination, much like fans flock outside SRK's Mumbai residence, Mannat. Furthermore, the building’s cutting-edge design includes a helipad and is even expected to feature an air taxi station, a nod to Dubai’s futuristic transit plans. Danube Properties has confirmed that the name ""Shahrukhz"" is guaranteed to remain with this specific tower in perpetuity.","Dubai developer Danube Group has launched Shahrukhz by Danube, a premium commercial tower on Sheikh Zayed Road.

This urban planning concept is a cornerstone of the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan and is already being realized through projects like the Model District in Al Barsha 2. Currently under construction. The goal is to reduce reliance on private vehicles by building compact, mixed-use communities that encourage local living. This means people will be able to live, work, study, and relax all within a 20-minute radius of their homes.A key metric in the plan is ensuring that 55 percent of Dubai’s residents live within 800 meters of a mass transit station, enabling them to reach 80 percent of their essential destinations with ease. The broader objective is to create smarter urban layouts that promote well-being, cut down on traffic congestion, and make everyday life more convenient for everyone, whether in newly developed areas or eventually in older neighborhoods as well.However, despite the well-thought-out design, one major challenge stands in the way: Dubai’s extreme summer heat.At Expo City Dubai, planners are leading the experimentation with adaptive solutions for year-round mobility, especially during the sweltering summer months.“In the winter, people are encouraged to walk,” explained Ivan Kyselov, Senior Manager of City Operations at Expo City Dubai, during his presentation at Mobility Live, a global event hosted at the venue that brings together experts in smart transport and mobility solutions.“It’s an experience and we promote it by activating the spaces around the walking routes. If you paint something on the pathway, kids will just simply play and walk these 15 minutes. Adults are the same. So we add an interactive element of architecture and urban development as a pit stop,” he added.To enhance accessibility and comfort, Expo City Dubai is adopting a flexible, seasonal approach:Kyselov noted these innovations are essential to maintaining multimodality, inclusivity, and accessibility throughout the year, especially in Dubai’s harsh climate.While new developments like Expo City are important, experts emphasized the importance of upgrading older districts to align with the 20-minute city model.Martin Tillman, a transport mobility planning expert, told Mobility Live attendees that regenerating aging urban areas should be a top priority.“We have to help regenerate the old city,” he said. “It's somewhat easier to go to a new field or site and to say this is how we're going to move forward. It's a little more difficult to go into something that's already existing and work on it because it doesn't have the parking provision or a rail network.”Tillman believes the effort is worth it:“The reward is significant,” he said. “Typically the previously planned cities were planned on the basis of better access for pedestrians and for people cycling. They tended to have better shape and were better coded for the day-to-day realities of living here in the Middle East. I think that's crucial and the idea of leaving that to decay is completely wrong.”With the Dubai 2040 Master Plan already underway, and projects like the Al Barsha 2 Model District and Expo City setting examples, the emirate is clearly committed to evolving its urban fabric.The idea of 20-minute cities offers:But success depends heavily on addressing climate realities, particularly by incorporating climate-controlled zones and adaptive infrastructure to keep residents comfortable and mobile year-round.If Dubai succeeds, it won’t just have redefined city living in the Gulf, it may also set a new benchmark for sustainable urban planning in hot climates globally.","Dubai is testing climate-controlled zones and shaded walkways to make its 20-minute city vision viable even during extreme summer heat. The goal is to reduce reliance on private vehicles by building compact, mixed-use communities that encourage local living.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125318051,imgsize-1329123,width-400,resizemode-4/dubai-20-minute-city.jpg"

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.





When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets. The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets. To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125131123,imgsize-132093,width-400,resizemode-4/enigmatic-legal-inquiry.jpg"

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification







Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Pensioners play a vital role in the social fabric of our society, and their financial security is paramount. To ensure continued access to pension benefits, annual life certificate submissions are mandatory for all pensioners. This process, which verifies the pensioner's living status, has been streamlined through various online and offline methods. With the recent initiatives to promote digital submissions, pensioners can conveniently fulfil this requirement and maintain their financial support.The requirement for pensioners to submit their jeevan pramaan patra is a critical process in ensuring the integrity and sustainability of pension funds. By providing multiple submission methods—both online and offline—the government is making it easier for pensioners to comply with this requirement. The ongoing digital campaigns further illustrate the government’s commitment to enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of pension services, ensuring that pensioners receive their benefits without unnecessary delays.The submission window for life certificates opened on November 1 for pensioners under the age of 80. This is part of an annual cycle during which pensioners must reaffirm their eligibility for pension disbursement. The deadline for submitting the life certificate is November 30. If the certificate is not submitted by this deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting in December. This requirement also applies to super senior citizens (aged 80 and above), who were allowed to submit their certificates starting on October 1, with the same November 30 deadline.Pensioners can submit their life certificates through several methods, accommodating various preferences and technological capabilities. Here are the options available:For those choosing to submit their life certificates online through the Jeevan Pramaan Portal, the following steps are involved:For pensioners opting for offline submission, the process is straightforward:If pensioners fail to submit their life certificates by the stipulated deadline, their pension payments will be halted starting the following month. However, payments will resume once the life certificate is submitted, thereby ensuring that pensioners do not permanently lose access to their funds, provided they complete the required process.In an effort to facilitate the submission process, the Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare (DoPPW) has initiated its third nationwide digital life certificate (DLC) campaign. This campaign runs from November 1 to November 30, covering 800 cities and districts. The campaign aims to promote the use of digital platforms for certificate submission, ensuring greater accessibility for pensioners.On the first day of this campaign, over 1.8 lakh pensioners successfully generated their digital life certificates, highlighting the growing adoption of technology among pensioners.

Meet Charlie Javice: Woman who scammed JP Morgan for $175M — but the bank is paying her $142M legal bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meet-charlie-javice-woman-who-scammed-jp-morgan-for-175m-but-the-bank-is-paying-her-142m-legal-bills/articleshow/125369591.cms,"How a startup deal turned into a massive fraud

A conviction that didn’t stop the bills

The controversial expenses

Why JPMorgan cannot simply stop paying





Charlie Javice’s story sounds almost too bizarre to be real: a young fintech founder who tricked JPMorgan into buying her startup for $175 million, ended up convicted of fraud, and is now serving a prison sentence, yet the same company she scammed is still paying more than $142 million for her legal bills, including questionable expenses like luxury hotel upgrades and “cellulite butter. ”Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid. When JPMorgan considered acquiring the startup in 2021, she reportedly presented the bank with millions of supposed student user accounts. Prosecutors later revealed that these numbers had been fabricated, with Javice allegedly hiring a data scientist to generate fake profiles to inflate Frank’s value.JPMorgan completed the acquisition believing Frank had more than four million users, only to discover after the deal that the platform had a tiny fraction of that. The bank alerted authorities, and by 2023 Javice was arrested on federal fraud charges.In March 2025, Javice was convicted of multiple fraud counts and sentenced to more than seven years in prison. But here’s where the story takes an unusual twist: despite defrauding the bank, she is still allowed to bill JPMorgan for her legal defence because of an indemnification clause included in the acquisition agreement.This contractual protection, which is common in startup buyouts, requires JPMorgan to cover certain legal costs for former executives of Frank.As a result, the bank has already paid over $142 million in defence expenses for Javice and her former colleague Olivier Amar.The clause itself is a standard feature in mergers, designed to protect executives from being financially ruined by lawsuits connected to their time at the company. In normal situations, it is meant to ensure fairness and prevent frivolous legal targeting after an acquisition. But in this case, it has trapped JPMorgan in a bizarre obligation: they must keep funding the defence of someone who defrauded them.Had the bank conducted even a simple, early-stage verification of Frank’s user data—such as requesting direct access to the platform’s actual customer records or running a basic audit—this entire dispute could have been avoided. Instead, delayed due diligence and overconfidence in the startup’s claims set the stage for a costly legal mess that continues years after the fraud was uncovered.JPMorgan’s frustration has grown as the legal bills have ballooned. The bank claims the expenses submitted include personal items such as cellulite butter, first-class travel upgrades, and hotel luxuries. Its lawyers argue that the billing records contain “extreme abuses,” including claims for work hours that seem physically impossible.Javice’s spokesperson denies that she personally submitted these questionable charges, stating that her legal team is responsible for all billing decisions.Even though Javice has already been convicted, she is now appealing her case, and the indemnification clause means the bank must continue paying her legal fees unless a court orders otherwise. JPMorgan is currently trying to convince a Delaware judge to halt these payments, arguing that the system is being misused.The saga has become a major lesson in the risks of fast-paced startup acquisitions. JPMorgan’s failure to properly verify Frank’s user base before buying the company has left it entangled in one of the most embarrassing and expensive due diligence failures in recent corporate history.","Charlie Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid.

New rules for Android apps take effect March 1, 2026

Google giving new tools to developers





Google is rolling out a significant update to the Play Store aimed at saving smartphone battery life by cracking down on apps that prevent devices from properly entering Sleep mode. In collaboration with Samsung, the company announced a new measure called ""excessive partial wake locks"" to monitor and penalise apps that force a phone's CPU to remain awake for prolonged periods in the background.Apps can hold Wake Locks to prevent the user’s device from entering Sleep mode, allowing the apps perform background work while the screen is OFF. Google defines the bad behavior threshold as “when 5% of an app’s user sessions over the last 28 days are excessive.”Starting March 1, 2026, Google will begin penalizing apps that hold a non-exempt wake lock for more than two hours within a 24-hour window. Wake locks are a necessary function, allowing apps to keep the device's CPU running while the screen is off for tasks like music playback or critical data transfers. However, prolonged wake locks are a major culprit behind rapid battery depletion, prompting Google's new policy.Apps will be placed in a ""warning zone"" if just 5% of user sessions—measured over a 28-day period—exceed the two-hour background wake lock limit. When this threshold is crossed, the app's visibility on the Play Store will be affected. What this means for Android apps:* Google may drop the apps from prominent recommendation and discovery lists.* App listings can receive a warning badge, explicitly indicating that the app may consume more battery due to high background usage. Essentially, Google Play will label apps that use ""excessive"" battery in the background, making it clearer for users to identify and avoid them. ""In some cases, we may display a warning on your store listing to indicate to users that your app may cause excessive battery drain,"" says Google.The new policy follows a successful beta rollout that began in April 2025, utilizing real-world device data and feedback from app creators. To help developers in meeting the new standard, Google has introduced a new table in Vitals within the Play Console. This tool allows developers to pinpoint precisely which Wake lock tags and durations are responsible for high battery consumption.Developers must now proactively address these background usage issues to maintain their apps' visibility, reputation, and standing on the Play Store.","New rules for Android apps take effect March 1, 2026.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”
