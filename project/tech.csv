‘Nice person’ asked my 13-yr-old daughter during online game to send nude photos: Akshay Kumar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nice-person-asked-my-13-yr-old-daughter-during-online-game-to-send-nude-photos-akshay-kumar/articleshow/124298311.cms,"ANI photo

MUMBAI: Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar recounted on Friday how his 13-year-old daughter, Nitara, dealt with sexual harassment while gaming online.A few months ago, while playing an online game that allowed strangers to interact, she was befriended by someone who initially engaged her with friendly messages.“The person started with polite messages like ‘thank you’, ‘well played’, and ‘fantastic’. He seemed like a nice person. After some time, he asked if she was male or female, and when she replied ‘female’, the tone of the conversation changed,” Kumar said. The stranger asked his daughter to send him nude pictures of herself.“My daughter immediately shut down the game and informed my wife. Thankfully, she didn’t hesitate to share what happened,” the actor said, speaking at the inauguration of Cybersecurity Awareness Month at the Maharashtra Police headquarters.The actor said the incident reflects a cybercrime pattern where predators first build trust and then attempt to exploit minors — a modus operandi that often ends in extortion and in tragic cases, suicide.CM Devendra Fadnavis emphasised the importance of reporting cybercrime on helplines 1930 and 1945 within the Golden Hour — which is the hour immediately after the crime has occurred. This, he said, is crucial in cases of cyber fraud, as it improved the odds of recovering stolen money.He said the state plans to raise awareness among school and college students on cybercrime. Fadnavis launched two resources that will be used in this awareness campaign — a documentary on cyber security and a comic book for children called ‘Cyber Warrior’.Fadnavis said the state needed to enhance capabilities to counter deepfakes. He said fraudsters use AI to trick people through phishing, OTP scams, deepfakes, voice and face cloning. “We share personal information on social media and through online transactions and payment platforms. Once cookies are accepted, personal data can be misused, leading to fraud, extortion and cyberbullying,” he said.Also present at the ceremony were actor Rani Mukerji , VJTI dean of R&D and consultancy Dr Farooq Kazi, associate professor at IIT Bombay Manjesh Hanawal, and IAS and IPS officers. Activists working to raise awareness on cybercrime were felicitated.","Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar recounted on Friday how his 13-year-old daughter, Nitara, dealt with sexual harassment while gaming online.

NEW DELHI: Starting Nov 15, if you don’t have a FASTag for your vehicle, or if the tag is invalid or non-functional, you will be allowed to pay 1.25 times the regular toll using UPI . This comes as a major relief, as currently, those without a valid FASTag are required to pay double the toll charge in cash, reports Dipak Dash. At present, nearly 98% of toll collection is done through FASTag.Also, if a vehicle with a valid and functional FASTag is unable to pay the toll due to malfunctioning of electronic toll collection infrastructure, the user will be allowed to cross the toll plaza without making any payment. These moves are intended to hold toll collection agencies accountable and ensure they maintain high-quality toll collection systems.","Starting Nov 15, if you don't have a FASTag for your vehicle, or if the tag is invalid or non-functional, you will be allowed to pay 1.25 times the regular toll using UPI.

Apple removes ICEBlock following Trump administration's pressure







A day after Apple removed the app ICEBlock from its iOS App Store, Google has taken down a similar app, Red Dot, from the Play Store, a report has said. Google confirmed the removal of Red Dot, explaining that its decision was based on a policy against apps presenting ‘a high risk of abuse’. Both apps have been designed to allow users to anonymously report sightings of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and view nearby alerts. It has been argued that such tools could potentially endanger law enforcement officers.According to a report by 404 Media, Google said it did not receive any outreach from the Department of Justice about the issue.Following a recent act of violence at the ICE facility, Google removed applications saying that it removes apps that facilitate sharing the location of ‘vulnerable groups’. While Google noted that ICEBlock was never available on the Play Store, the company confirmed that its moderation standards apply broadly to any app that handles user-generated content.“ICEBlock was never available on Google Play, but we removed similar apps for violations of our policies,” Google added.Apple removed the popular application ICEBlock and several similar apps from its App Store – triggering debate over technology, government oversight and civil liberties.ICEBlock – just like Red Dot – had been used by hundreds of thousands of people, allowing individuals to anonymously report and view the locations of nearby ICE agents within a five-mile radius.The removal follows mounting pressure from the Trump administration, which reportedly threatened legal action against both the app’s creators and media outlets reporting on the tool. Apple confirmed it removed the apps after receiving contact from ""law enforcement,"" though it did not specify which agency or agencies were involved.By providing real-time alerts on ICE agent locations, ICEBlock quickly became a focal point in the national discussion concerning immigration enforcement, privacy rights, and free speech protections. While critics argued that the app could endanger federal agents, supporters defended it as an essential tool for community awareness and protection.","Apple removes ICEBlock following Trump administration's pressure.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

Digitally linked to your passport



Valid for up to three years, or until the passport expires — whichever comes first



Required before boarding flights, trains, or ships bound for the Schengen Area









Starting 12 October 2025, travellers from the UAE heading to Europe will experience a major change at Schengen Area borders. The European Union ’s Entry/Exit System (EES) will go live, replacing the traditional manual passport stamping process with a digital border control system that uses biometric data. Designed to enhance security and streamline entry for non-EU visitors, the system applies to millions of third-country nationals, including those travelling from the UAE.Here’s a complete breakdown of what the EES is, who it affects, how it works, and what UAE residents need to prepare for before their next trip to Europe.The EES introduces automated border checks for non-EU nationals entering or exiting the Schengen Area for short stays. This includes UAE citizens and residents who are visa-exempt or travelling on a Schengen short-stay visa (up to 90 days in any 180-day period).From 12 October 2025, border control officers will digitally register the following data on arrival:This data is stored in a centralised EU database managed by eu-LISA, the European Agency for large-scale IT systems in the fields of freedom, security, and justice.On future trips, travellers won’t need to repeat the full biometric process.Instead, the system will verify identity using previously stored data and digitally log border crossings.Importantly, manual passport stamping will gradually be phased out, though some locations may continue to stamp passports during the system’s early rollout phase.The EES only applies to travellers from non-EU countries, meaning it directly affects UAE citizens and residents visiting the Schengen Area for short stays.Airlines operating in the UAE, including Emirates and Air Arabia, have already issued alerts to their passengers about the upcoming changes. Both carriers are advising travellers to allow extra time at border checks, especially during their first visit after the system goes live, as the new process could take longer than usual.The European Union is launching the EES to modernise its border management, increase security, and improve efficiency for both authorities and travellers. The current system — manually stamping passports — is time-consuming, often inaccurate, and unable to reliably detect overstayers.The EES aims to:The system also supports wider use of automated border control gates and self-service kiosks, making travel more seamless once initial biometric data is captured.This initiative is part of the EU’s broader Security Union agenda, supporting the goals of the European Agenda on Security and the European Agenda on Migration, particularly around countering terrorism and cross-border crime.The proposal for the EES was initially presented on 6 April 2016 under the Smart Borders Package. After negotiations, it was adopted on 20 November 2017, and came into force on 29 December 2017.The EES collects and stores several pieces of personal and biometric information:All data is stored securely and handled under strict EU data protection laws. Access is limited to:In certain circumstances, data may also be shared with international organisations or third countries under regulated conditions.Each travel record remains valid for three years from the last recorded crossing. If you cross the border again, the clock resets. Renewing your passport will not affect your stored data — the system will automatically match your new passport with your existing biometric records through facial recognition.There is no need to register in advance. Your biometric data will be collected on your first entry after the system goes live.Although the EES is intended to replace manual stamps, some countries or border points may still apply physical stamps temporarily during the transition period.There is no insurance requirement under the EES. However, some countries (e.g., France) may ask at kiosks whether travellers have medical coverage. Travel insurance is highly recommended but remains optional.Some EU countries may offer National Facilitation Programmes to speed up border checks for frequent visitors. Eligibility criteria and availability vary by member state.The EES applies across all external borders of the Schengen Area. Travellers from the UAE should expect the new system when visiting any of the following countries:Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland.While the Entry/Exit System (EES) is set to launch in October 2025, another significant change is scheduled to follow about a year later: the introduction of ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System) — often referred to as the “Euro visa.”ETIAS will be a mandatory pre-travel authorisation for visa-exempt nationals, including those from the UAE and the UK, who plan to travel to any of the 30 European countries in the Schengen Area. It is not a visa, but it is a compulsory security clearance designed to screen travellers before they arrive.The authorisation is:If a traveller gets a new passport, they must apply for a new ETIAS authorisation, even if their previous one was still valid.Once implemented, ETIAS will work in tandem with the EES, further tightening EU border security by vetting travellers in advance and tracking their movements upon arrival and departure.For now, the focus remains on the smooth rollout of the EES, a foundational shift in how Europe manages border entry, aiming to balance security, efficiency, and traveller experience.","From October 2025, the EU’s EES system will replace manual passport stamping with biometric checks for all non-EU travellers, including UAE citizens. This includes UAE citizens and residents who are visa-exempt or travelling on a Schengen short-stay visa (up to 90 days in any 180-day period) The EES is designed to enhance security and streamline entry for non- EU visitors.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124298009,imgsize-1160036,width-400,resizemode-4/eu-ees-system.jpg"
UAE: Dubai to roll out over 200 ultra-fast EV charging stations for taxis starting this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-dubai-to-roll-out-over-200-ultra-fast-ev-charging-stations-for-taxis-starting-thisyear/articleshow/124295417.cms,"Dubai launches 208 ultra-fast EV chargers for taxis and EVs, cutting costs, charging time, and boosting green mobility /AI Representative Image, for illustrative purposes only

How Dubai’s EV chargers will cut carbon emissions



Dubai taxi fleet electrification: Faster charging for drivers and riders

How this fits Dubai’s bigger EV plan





Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) and Dubai Taxi Company (DTC) have signed a long-term contract to roll out 208 ultra-fast EV charging points across the emirate - a move aimed at speeding up taxi fleet electrification and cutting transport emissions. The deal was signed at WETEX 2025 and is part of DEWA’s EV Green Charger program.The first phase will launch two main charging hubs: DTC’s depot near Dubai International Airport and DTC’s headquarters in Muhaisnah 4. The stations will include next-generation chargers with capacities up to 360 kW, designed to serve the growing electric taxi fleet and support fast turnaround times for vehicles. The rollout of 208 points will take place over the contract period and aligns with DTC’s broader fleet transformation plans.Dubai’s new ultra-fast EV charging stations will officially begin rolling out in late 2025, with the first two major hubs operational near Dubai International Airport (DTC depot) and Muhaisnah 4 (DTC headquarters). The full network of 208 charging points is expected to be gradually completed over the next 12–18 months, ensuring wider coverage for taxi fleets and public EV users.For drivers, the charging service is designed to be affordable and convenient.DEWA has confirmed that pricing will follow standard EV Green Charger tariffs, with potential special rates for fleet operators like Dubai Taxi Company to support the transition to electric vehicles. Drivers can pay using DEWA’s mobile app, smart cards, or contactless payment methods at each station, making the process seamless Access is straightforward: taxi operators and individual EV owners can register through the DEWA EV Green Charger portal or app, select the nearest available charger, and start charging immediately once registered. The ultra-fast chargers, with capacities up to 360 kW, can significantly reduce charging times, allowing taxis to return to service in under 30 minutes at high-power stations.This rollout ensures that drivers face minimal downtime, can plan routes efficiently around charging points, and benefit from a growing, reliable EV infrastructure. With careful planning, fleet operators can optimize schedules and reduce operational costs while contributing to Dubai’s green mobility and carbon reduction goals.DEWA and DTC estimate the initial phase will reduce about 37,939 metric tonnes of CO₂ annually; when combined with DTC’s existing chargers, annual savings could reach around 49,654 tonnes. This contribution supports Dubai’s Green Mobility Strategy 2030 and the UAE’s Net Zero 2050 goals. The project is explicitly framed as a climate-action step as much as an infrastructure upgrade.DTC aims to electrify its entire fleet of taxis and limousines by 2040, with the EV fleet expected to surpass 2,500 vehicles by 2030. Ultra-fast chargers (up to 360 kW) will shorten charging windows and improve operational efficiency for drivers, helping taxis return to service faster. This contract complements other private-sector rollouts in Dubai designed to cut charge times to “under 30 minutes” at many ultra-fast sites. Together, these moves make daily EV operations more practical for commercial fleets and drivers.DEWA’s EV Green Charger initiative, launched in 2014, already supports 1,500+ charging points across Dubai; the new DTC agreement adds capacity targeted at fleet needs while strengthening the public charging ecosystem. Other recent projects (private and public) aim to install hundreds more ultra-fast points across high-traffic locations, retail hubs, residential clusters and transport nodes over the next 12–24 months. This layered approach (fleet hubs + public ultra-fast sites) is intended to reduce range anxiety and accelerate EV adoption citywide.DEWA–DTC deal is a practical step to electrify Dubai’s transport layer: it pairs high-power chargers with clear fleet targets and measurable carbon savings. For drivers, fleet operators and residents this means cleaner rides, shorter charging waits and a faster path to a greener city.","Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) and Dubai Taxi Company (DTC) have signed a long-term contract to roll out 208 ultra-fast EV charging points across the emirate.

Awareness through the ‘Your Comment’ initiative





Abu Dhabi Police have released footage of a serious traffic accident caused by a vehicle stopping without justification in the middle of a busy road, a reckless act that triggered a chain of crashes involving other inattentive drivers. The video, broadcast in coordination with the Command and Control Center, forms part of the police’s ongoing efforts to raise awareness about dangerous road behavior.The footage, which shows several cars colliding after one vehicle came to a sudden stop, highlights the grave consequences of not paying full attention while driving. According to the Directorate of Traffic and Security Patrols, many of the vehicles involved were driven by individuals distracted by things other than the road, unable to react in time to the unexpected hazard.Authorities clarified that stopping in the middle of the road is strictly prohibited, regardless of the reason — whether due to a tire malfunction, mechanical failure, or otherwise. Drivers are required to exit the roadway safely and head toward the nearest shoulder or designated stopping point to avoid obstructing traffic and endangering lives.If the vehicle cannot be moved, motorists must immediately call 999 to contact the Operations Room, enabling police to deploy support and minimize the risk of further accidents or traffic congestion.Additionally, other road users who encounter vehicles stopped improperly should turn on hazard lights, maintain a safe distance, and stay fully alert to avoid collisions. Police emphasized that even a momentary distraction can have catastrophic consequences, particularly in high-speed zones.The warning comes alongside a reminder about the legal consequences of irresponsible road behavior:Stopping randomly in the middle of the road without valid justification:Obstructing traffic flow:Using a mobile phone or being distracted while driving:Running a red light (motorcyclists and motorists):These penalties reflect the UAE’s strict commitment to road safety and are designed to prevent accidents that often result in severe injuries or loss of life.The crash footage forms part of Abu Dhabi Police’s “Your Comment” initiative, a public safety campaign where real accident clips are posted on social media to highlight the dangers of specific violations. This initiative encourages public discussion around safe driving practices, with each video serving as a real-world example of how reckless behavior can lead to devastating outcomes.Authorities reiterated their message: Stay focused, never stop in active lanes, and call 999 for help when needed. Community members are also encouraged to report illegal or unsafe road behavior using any of the police’s official communication channels.","Abu Dhabi Police have released footage of a serious traffic accident caused by a vehicle stopping without justification in the middle of a busy road.

Direct Dubai-Abu Dhabi bus route linking Al Quoz and MBZ City





Expanding Dubai-Abu Dhabi bus network for improved accessibility



Part of a bigger shift toward seamless mobility





In a move to improve intercity connectivity and expand public transport options, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has launched a new direct, non-stop bus service between Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Operating in partnership with Capital Express — a major transport provider in Abu Dhabi and Al Ain — this express service is designed to serve residents in areas of Dubai not previously covered by existing routes to the capital.The new express bus connects Al Quoz Bus Station in Dubai with MBZ City Bus Station in Abu Dhabi, operating non-stop along Sheikh Zayed Road, the main highway linking the two emirates. With no scheduled stops in between, the estimated journey time ranges from 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours, depending on real-time traffic conditions. This is slightly faster than traditional intercity buses, which typically take 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours 30 minutes, especially when serving multiple stops along the route.Each journey is priced at Dh25 ($6.80) per person, with payments accepted via cash, contactless bank cards, or nol cards — the latter being the city's unified fare payment system. The service runs seven days a week, with buses departing every three hours.Each bus accommodates up to 50 passengers and features bright green livery for easy identification.While the RTA have yet to disclose the specific route number or publish a full timetable, the frequency and non-stop nature mark this as a distinct addition to the intercity network.Until now, intercity buses between Dubai and Abu Dhabi primarily departed from Al Ghubaiba Bus Station (serving Bur Dubai) and Ibn Battuta Bus Station, which caters to commuters from areas like Jebel Ali, JLT, Dubai Marina, and The Palm. The addition of the Al Quoz route offers a new departure point for residents in Umm Suqeim, Al Barsha, and nearby neighborhoods, significantly improving accessibility.This development is part of the RTA’s broader public transport strategy, which focuses on enhancing connectivity, intermodal integration, and commuter convenience. The authority aims to make public transport a first-choice option by linking buses with other transit modes such as the Dubai Metro, tram, and marine transport.The launch follows similar intercity transport expansions, including a Dubai-Sharjah service introduced in May 2025. That service, known as Route 308, connects Stadium Bus Station in Dubai to Al Jubail Bus Station in Sharjah at a fare of Dh12 per trip. The RTA also recently introduced five new bus routes across Dubai and modified several existing routes to meet growing demand and improve commuting efficiency.According to Adel Shakeri, Director of Planning and Business Development at RTA’s Public Transport Agency, improving intermodal transport options is vital to encouraging the use of public transit. The goal, he stated, is to offer smoother and more efficient journeys by connecting various transportation modes and routes across the city and beyond.Currently, the RTA operates a fleet of over 250 intercity buses, all of which are equipped with free Wi-Fi, allowing passengers to stay connected, whether for work or leisure, during their commute.Looking ahead, more developments are on the horizon. The long-awaited Etihad Rail passenger service is scheduled to launch in 2026, offering high-speed train travel between Dubai and Abu Dhabi in under an hour. Beyond speed and comfort, Etihad Rail plans to integrate seamlessly with existing metro routes and feeder bus services, enhancing last-mile connectivity and ensuring smooth transfers between the rail network and the cities’ broader public transport systems. While buses remain the most budget-friendly transport option between the emirates for now, rail is set to introduce a new dimension of convenience and efficiency for commuters.","Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has launched a new direct, non-stop bus service between Dubai and Abu Dhabi.

When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows … Common Knowledge and the Science of Harmony, Hypocrisy and Outrage

Steven Pinker





The purpose of language is to coordinate human behaviour and this starts from the earliest moments in our life. When three-year-olds are taught the word ‘mouse’ they do not worry that it means other things to other people. They tacitly assume ‘common knowledge’. The same cognitive talent also takes its own outputs and feeds these back into more cognition, which is how human progress happens.Thus, in his new book, cognitive scientisthas a new focal point (common knowledge) alongside the running theme of his broader work, ‘recursive mentalising’. As in, I know something and you know it with common knowledge, also, I know that you know it and I know that you know that I know…Pluralistic ignorance | In dictatorships, people conceal their political opinion to avoid being punished, so they can’t know if their discontent is widely shared. A demonstration in a public place can, however, generate the common knowledge neededto coordinate resistance.Why have the past two decades seen the success rate of nonviolent civil resistance campaigns start to decline (though they still outperform the violent ones)? Because of the dictators’ learning curve. Their censors now squelch posts that might coordinate action.You can’t agree to disagree | Facts don’t care about your feelings.Pinker asks, why should the SARS-CoV-2 virus, or life on Mars, or the gunman of Nov 1963, care about your melanin or your genitals or your DNA or what you learned at your mother’s knee? Real human disagreements can come from dishonesty as much as from incompetence. Either way, what we need to do is make our own deliberation more rational.The canceling instinct | It comes from the fear that common knowledge is what makes an idea dangerous. What Pinker reminds us is that the moral order did not collapse when people accepted that the Earth was not the centre of the cosmos, nor that humans were descended from apes.Humans have clawed increments of progress out of an indifferent universe only by the process of conjecture and refutation, where the better ideas prevail in the long run. Universities cannot discover and transmit knowledge without intellectual freedom. And an academic establishment that stifles debate can end up providing false guidance on vital issues.Pinker writes that many of the early policies for combatting the pandemic – including draconian lockdowns – have now been revealed as not being based on scientific evidence. They were imposed by demonising what turned out to be reasonable criticisms. The toll this took on the economy, on mental health, on children’s education also undercut people’s trust in science and public health.Rational hypocrisy | But guess what Pinker says is the ultimate dishonesty? Calling for complete honesty! Everywhere the rationale for obliterating zones of privacy is, if you aren’t doing anything wrong you should have nothing to hide. But neither authentic human relationships nor homo sapiens’ overall interdependence would survive making every wisecrack, conversation and thought public.While the historical trend of transparency is welcome, civilisation won’t survive putting every kind of private and reciprocal knowledge into common knowledge.","In his new book, cognitive scientist Steven Pinker has a new focal point (common knowledge) The purpose of language is to coordinate human behaviour and this starts from the earliest moments in our life.

Emirates NBD app verification rollout plan and timeline



Why UAE banks are abandoning SMS OTPs — security and customer experience





How to prepare: enable ENBD X verification and backup options

What customers should watch for and common concerns





Emirates NBD will replace one-time passwords (OTPs) sent by SMS or email with app-based verification through its ENBD X mobile app, starting a phased rollout on 1 November 2025 and extending to debit/credit card alerts soon after. The move follows a wider Central Bank push to eliminate SMS/email OTPs and shift customers to stronger, in-app authentication.Emirates NBD says it will phase out SMS OTPs and use push-based confirmations within the ENBD X app to approve online transactions and transfers. The initial phase begins 1 November 2025, covering account transfers and low-value alerts (reports say transfers of AED 100 or less will be included first), with debit and credit card transaction alerts to follow as the bank expands the system. The bank and industry sources add that the Central Bank of the UAE has directed banks to fully phase out SMS/email OTPs by March 2026, so this change is part of a regulated, sector-wide transition.SMS and email OTPs have become a prime target for fraud: SIM-swap attacks, SMS-interception and social-engineering schemes have exposed customers’ accounts. App-based authentication (push notifications, biometrics and soft tokens) reduces those risks because approvals happen inside a secured app bound to the customer’s device, often combined with biometric checks.Regulators and banks say the switch improves security and speeds up transactions while reducing reliance on telecom channels.If you bank with Emirates NBD, take three practical steps now: download or update the ENBD X app, register your device and enable in-app push notifications and biometric sign-in; confirm your mobile number and contact details with the bank; and learn about fallback options (for example, Emirates NBD’s Smart Pass/soft-token flows or bank support lines) if you lose your device or travel abroad. Emirates NBD’s mobile-banking pages list registration steps and troubleshooting advice for customers who cannot access app authentication.For customers, the change means that SMS codes will no longer arrive during transactions. Instead, a push notification will appear on the Emirates NBD app, requiring approval before the transaction is processed. This applies across the board from peer-to-peer transfers within the UAE to international remittances and online shopping payments linked to bank cards. The bank has urged users to update their mobile banking apps and ensure notifications are enabled before the new process takes full effect. Those who have not activated the app on their devices may face delays or disruptions in accessing banking services.The change aims to make online banking safer and faster across the UAE. If you’re an Emirates NBD customer, update ENBD X, enable in-app authentication and check official bank messages for the exact dates that affect your card, account transfers or alerts. For anything unclear, contact Emirates NBD support or visit the bank’s mobile-banking help pages.",Emirates NBD says it will phase out SMS OTPs and use push-based confirmations within the ENBD X app to approve online transactions and transfers.

After nearly six months of silence, the Dubai Fountain made its long-awaited return with a newly upgraded showcase that drew thousands to the heart of Downtown. According to local media, by late afternoon, the edges of Burj Lake were packed with visitors families, tourists, and residents, many raising their phones to capture photos and videos. People rushed to secure prime spots along the promenade and boardwalk, eager for the best views as the crowd grew steadily ahead of the 6:30 PM performance.Ahead of the relaunch, the enhanced sound system at Dubai Mall reportedly began playing music across the waterfront. Boats were observed preparing the lake’s surface for the evening show, contributing to a growing sense of anticipation as the start time neared.The inaugural performance featured “Emsaha Dubai” by Coral Al Emarat, a four-minute patriotic anthem whose title translates to “The name is Dubai.” The song is dedicated to the city’s leadership, including Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and the late Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, celebrating their vision and steadfast support. This was followed by a second display, choreographed to “Time to Say Goodbye” by Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman , a classic orchestral piece that has become a staple in large-scale musical events.Subsequent shows continued through the evening at 30-minute intervals, including a composition by Grammy-winning artist Christopher Tin, a Mandarin pop song that resonated with visiting tour groups from China, and Adele’s “Skyfall”, a crowd favourite from past fountain playlists. The return program was designed to offer a renewed but familiar experience, blending emotional resonance with technical brilliance.According to Khaleej Times, large numbers of spectators stayed on to watch multiple rounds of the show, capturing photos and videos of the returning spectacle. Each performance, though built on the same upgraded systems, varied in music and choreography, adding to the draw for those who stayed to watch more than once.The fountain's return comes after a five-month closure, announced in February by Emaar Properties, to allow for a full-scale overhaul. The goal was not just cosmetic enhancement, but a reengineering of its foundational systems for better durability and performance.These enhancements aim to improve show reliability, reduce maintenance needs, and offer a smoother experience to spectators while preserving the fountain’s original identity.Originally unveiled on 8 May 2009 during The Dubai Mall’s grand opening, the Dubai Fountain was designed by WET Design — the visionary creators of the iconic Bellagio Fountains in Las Vegas. It quickly became the world's largest choreographed (Dancing) fountain, stretching an impressive 275 metres across the manmade Burj Lake and capable of shooting 22,000 gallons of water up to 150 metres in the air. The dazzling project cost approximately AED 800 million (about ₹1,800 crores at the time).Powered by 6,600 lights and 25 colour projectors, the fountain has consistently mesmerised over 14 million visitors annually, weaving stories through coordinated movement, vivid light, and immersive sound. Music choices over the years have included global names like Adele, Pavarotti, Edith Piaf, Lionel Richie, and popular K-pop group EXO, among many other celebrated artists.During the shutdown, Emaar maintained strong public engagement by installing 500 metres of high-definition digital screens along the bustling Dubai Mall promenade, looping archival footage of past shows in sync with Burj Khalifa’s LED displays — preserving a lasting sense of connection to the fountain, even as physical shows temporarily paused.ed.With its return, the Dubai Fountain is now operating on new show timings:","Dubai Fountain made its long-awaited return with a newly upgraded showcase that drew thousands to the heart of Downtown.

What comes next: Phase Two and future enhancements

“The return of Dubai Fountain is a celebration of Dubai itself – its spirit, its energy, and its ability to inspire the world. This landmark has always brought people together, creating shared moments of wonder and joy. When the fountain reopens, it will remind us once again of what Dubai represents: innovation, ambition, and the creation of experiences that leave a lasting impression on everyone who visits.”



The Dubai Fountain: Largest choreographed fountain in the world









After five months of intensive redevelopment, the Dubai Fountain is set to officially reopen on Wednesday, October 1, 2025. Emaar has confirmed the date and shared details about a thorough two-phase upgrade designed to boost the fountain’s performance, technology, and overall visitor experience. With a revamped infrastructure, state-of-the-art robotics, and refreshed visuals, the iconic Downtown Dubai attraction is ready to return bigger and better than ever. Visitors can look forward to smoother, more precise shows featuring enhanced lighting, sharper choreography, and stunning water displays that promise to captivate both longtime fans and first-time viewers alike.The Dubai Fountain will resume operations on Wednesday, October 1, following a complete five-month shutdown that began on April 19, 2025. While speculation had circulated on social media in the weeks leading up to the confirmation, developer Emaar officially announced the reopening on September 27.The first show marking the grand return is scheduled for 6:30 PM on October 1. Regular showtimes will resume as follows:The reopening marks the completion of Phase One of the redevelopment project. Phase Two, introducing additional new features, is scheduled for completion in the second quarter of 2026.The first phase involved a full-scale shutdown of the attraction, during which the entire 30-acre Burj Khalifa Lake was drained. This enabled major structural work, including:This deep structural work was essential to ensure both performance reliability and long-term maintenance efficiency, while preserving the fountain’s original grandeur.During this five-month closure, the site remained accessible visually. Emaar installed 500 metres of high-definition digital screens along the Dubai Mall promenade. These screens showcased looped archival footages of past performances in sync with the visuals of Burj Khalifa light displays, maintaining a sense of continuity and visitor engagement despite the ongoing construction.The redevelopment is more than cosmetic—it represents a fundamental reengineering of how the Dubai Fountain operates.Key upgrades now integrated include:These changes aim to deliver smoother motion, richer sensory experience, and overall improved show reliability. The system is designed to require less maintenance, reducing potential downtime in the future.Despite all the upgrades, the iconic identity of the Dubai Fountain remains intact, with water jets spraying up to 22,000 gallons of water as high as 150 metres into the air at any given time, illuminated by 6,600 lights and 25 colour projectors, all now performing on a more resilient and technologically advanced platform.The work isn’t fully complete. Emaar confirmed that the reopening marks only the end of the first phase. Phase Two, expected to conclude by Q2 2026, will introduce additional technological features and creative enhancements.While specific elements of the second phase are still under wraps, Emaar has emphasized that it will combine creativity and next-generation technology to continue evolving the fountain experience and deliver “fresh moments of wonder.”Mohamed Alabbar, Founder of Emaar, described the reopening as a symbolic moment for Dubai:The Dubai Fountain, originally launched on May 8, 2009, remains the largest choreographed fountain in the world, stretching 275 metres across the manmade lake beneath the Burj Khalifa. Designed by WET Design, the same creators behind the Bellagio Fountains in Las Vegas, it has long been a centrepiece of Downtown Dubai’s global allure.Now, with an entirely upgraded infrastructure and advanced show capabilities, it’s ready to reclaim its place in the city’s cultural spotlight—offering both returning and first-time visitors a renewed experience that blends technology, spectacle, and architectural ambition.The wait is over. The fountains are back.","The Dubai Fountain closed on April 19, 2025, for a five-month upgrade. The entire 30-acre Burj Khalifa Lake was drained to allow major structural upgrades.

As schools reopen in Abu Dhabi for the 2025–26 academic year, a major update in student transport policy by the Department of Education and Knowledge (ADEK) is taking effect, and every parent needs to be prepared. From who can pick up your child, to whether they can ride a scooter to school, these new rules are detailed, safety-focused, and carry clear responsibilities for families. Here's a breakdown of everything you must know as the school run begins.One of the most significant updates affects older students. Starting this academic year, students in Cycle 3 (Grades 9–12, ages 14–18) are allowed to commute independently to and from school without using school transport. This includes the use of bicycles, scooters, or other personal transport — as long as certain conditions are met.However, parents must sign a detailed consent form that confirms:If a school does allow the use of personal vehicles like bikes or scooters on its premises, it must provide dedicated infrastructure, including tracks and parking spaces. Schools also retain the right to regulate how and where these are used within the campus.Important: The school is not liable for any incidents that occur while the student is commuting independently — this responsibility falls to the parents.For students under 15, independent travel is not allowed. These students must be picked up and dropped off by an adult, either a parent or a parent-appointed guardian. If no adult is present at the drop-off point, the child will be taken back to school after all other students are dropped off.However, there's some flexibility if you have older children:This system ensures that younger children are never left unsupervised during transit, while giving families a practical option when an adult isn’t available for pick-up.School buses are strictly reserved for student transportation. However, for field trips, tourist buses may be used, as long as they meet technical and safety standards like:The maximum allowable time for a school bus journey is 60 minutes — from the first pick-up point to the last drop-off. Students can only be picked up and dropped off at pre-designated locations.For students under 11 years old, a bus supervisor must ensure that a parent or appointed guardian is physically present at the drop-off point. If no one is available, the student will be safely returned to school.Each bus carrying students under age 11 must have a registered supervisor, in addition to a driver. Both the driver and supervisor must hold ITC permits.Bus transport fees are regulated and must align with the ITC School Bus Fee Framework. Operators propose the fee, which must be approved by ADEK. Any exceptional increases require prior coordination with ITC.To help parents stay informed and reassured, schools will use Salama — a school transport monitoring application developed by the Integrated Transport Centre (ITC) of Abu Dhabi. This app is designed to enhance school bus safety by offering parents full visibility into their child’s daily commute.Through Salama, parents can:The bus supervisor must maintain regular communication with both parents and the school, and is responsible for:Every school must appoint a School Transport Coordinator, whose contact information must be shared with parents and bus operators. This person is the main contact for any issue that goes beyond the bus supervisor’s duties, including:Schools are required to implement traffic control plans for safe pick-up and drop-off:The updated school transport policy by ADEK is not just a set of rules, it’s a framework to ensure every child’s journey to and from school is safe, structured, and well-supervised.Whether your child is taking the school bus, riding a scooter, or getting picked up by an older sibling, there are clear expectations and shared responsibilities between schools, parents, and students.To stay compliant, and ensure your child’s safety, make sure to:","Abu Dhabi schools reopen for the 2025–26 academic year.

“Driving the Future of Transport and Global Connectivity,”





Etihad Rail’s ambitious passenger train project took center stage at the Global Rail 2025 exhibition in Abu Dhabi, where visitors got their first close look at the soon-to-be operational service set to redefine intercity travel across the UAE. The event, held at ADNEC Centre, gathered international leaders and experts to spotlight innovation and cooperation in transport and connectivity.The Global Rail 2025 exhibition and conference opened today at ADNEC Centre Abu Dhabi and will continue through October 2. Held under the themethe event has drawn significant international attention, welcoming over 20 ministerial delegations and industry leaders from both the public and private sectors. With participants from more than 100 nationalities, the three-day gathering is expected to receive over 20,000 international visitors.Spanning four exhibition halls, the event features more than 200 companies and brands from 14 key sectors, including infrastructure, rolling stock, digital innovation, finance, and smart mobility. Over 70 companies are debuting at this year’s exhibition, and more than 11 national rail operators are in attendance.A major highlight of the exhibition has been Etihad Rail’s unveiling of its upcoming passenger train cabins—marking the first public look into what the future of rail travel in the UAE will look like. The sleek, silver train model displayed prominently at the venue features the distinctive black and red Etihad Rail branding and gives visitors a tangible preview of what’s to come when passenger operations begin in 2026.The passenger trains will include three distinct travel classes: economy, family, and first class. The economy cabin features dark grey, back-to-back seating; the family cabin offers face-to-face seats with a long central table for group convenience; and the first-class cabin provides wider, adjustable seats designed for comfort. All cabins come equipped with tray tables, overhead luggage compartments, and additional dedicated spaces for larger baggage.Passengers will enter stations through automated ticket barriers. While it is encouraged to book tickets online in advance, ticket vending machines will also be available at stations. A sample of the machine on display shows it as black and grey in color, with support for payments via bank notes, cards, and Apple Pay. These machines allow users to choose their travel class, input journey start and end points, and specify any special requirements.Train journeys are designed to be swift and efficient. Once operational, the Abu Dhabi to Dubai route will take 57 minutes. Travel time to Fujairah will be around 100 minutes, and to Ruwais, approximately 70 minutes. The trains are expected to run at speeds of up to 200 km/h.Two types of trains will operate on the network. Chinese-manufactured CRC cabins will offer 365 seats, while Spanish CAF cabins will provide 369 seats. Though both models support the same class structure, slight design variations will differentiate the two interiors.The railway service is also making efforts to create a seamless and branded customer experience. Train drivers will wear grey and black uniforms, while station and train hosts will don cream and red uniforms.As excitement builds for Etihad Rail’s full-scale passenger operations, one detail still remains under wraps: ticket pricing. Additionally, specifics regarding last-mile connectivity options for passengers have yet to be disclosed.Nevertheless, the grand unveiling marks a significant step forward in the UAE’s long-term infrastructure and mobility plans, offering both residents and visitors an efficient and highly comfortable alternative to road transport.","Etihad Rail's passenger trains, launching in 2026, will connect Abu Dhabi to Dubai in 57 minutes.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

""They care a lot about your success stories outside your technical expertise. I think I'm a better talker than a coder, so I was very excited for that,”

“Many times I did feel hopeless, but I think it truly is a numbers game. You just need to apply to everything you're qualified for,”





TikTok has helped a recent software engineering graduate get a job at Amazon . 22-year-old Andrew Chen has claimed that he used the Chinese short video app to document his 10-day preparation period for the final interview. Chen, who had just weeks remaining before earning his computer science degree from the University of California, San Diego, used the public documentation as a tool to maintain focus and accountability. Due to the 10-day deadline, Chen created a study plan that included coding practice on LeetCode, behavioural interview preparation, and studying Amazon's Leadership Principles. He searched platforms like Reddit and Blind for insights into Amazon’s interview process and memorised personal stories in the STAR format to illustrate his values.In May, Chen started posting his preparation updates on TikTok, with the caption,He saw public sharing as a way to keep himself accountable while also opening the door to advice from people who had already faced similar interviews.Chen’s videos, which gained up to 2.6 million views, sparked mixed reactions, with some doubting his chances due to limited preparation time.In a statement to Business Insider, Chen said:He described Amazon’s ""loop"" interview as three consecutive virtual rounds: one on technical questions, one on behavioural scenarios linked to leadership principles, and one combining both.he said.In June, after completing other interviews, Chen received a six-figure offer from Amazon. He shared the news on TikTok, gaining over 941,000 views. After graduating in mid-June, he moved to New York City and began working in July. His key takeaway was Amazon’s strong focus on behavioural questions linked to its leadership principles, which he felt suited him well.Chen noted.He also shared some advice for job seekers, which is that while quality applications are essential, applying in high volume is crucial in a competitive market.Chen added.","Andrew Chen, 22, used the Chinese short video app to document his 10-day preparation period for the final interview.

Various tech companies confirm data theft



Salesforce targeted directly, company says no indication of data theft







An English-speaking hacking group — operating under names like Lapsus$, Scattered Spider, and ShinyHunters – has launched a dedicated data leak website on the dark web to extort its victims, a report has said, adding that the group, now calling the site Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters, is threatening to release approximately one billion records stolen from companies using cloud databases hosted by Salesforce.According to a report by TechCrunch, the website, spotted by threat intelligence researchers on Friday (October 3), is designed to pressure victims into paying a ransom to prevent the publication of their stolen data.“Contact us to regain control on data governance and prevent public disclosure of your data. Do not be the next headline,” the hackers' site reportedly reads.Over the last few weeks, the ShinyHunters gang allegedly breached dozens of high-profile companies by targeting their cloud-based databases hosted by Salesforce. Several major corporations have confirmed their data was compromised in these mass hacks, including Insurance giant Allianz Life, Google , Airline Qantas, and Carmaking giant Stellantis, among others.The leak site also lists several additional alleged victims, such as FedEx, Hulu (owned by Disney), and Toyota Motors.The hackers have also directly targeted Salesforce on the site, demanding that the company negotiate a ransom and threatening that otherwise “all your customers [sic] data will be leaked.”In a statement provided by spokesperson Nicole Aranda, Salesforce confirmed it is ""aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors,"" but maintained confidence in its platform's security.“Our findings indicate these attempts relate to past or unsubstantiated incidents, and we remain engaged with affected customers to provide support. At this time, there is no indication that the Salesforce platform has been compromised, nor is this activity related to any known vulnerability in our technology,"" the statement read.","English-speaking hacking group has launched a dedicated data leak website on the dark web to extort its victims.

AMD responds to partnership ‘rumours’







AMD has responded to a report which claimed that the company is in early discussions with rival chipmaker Intel to manufacture chips for AMD's products within Intel’s foundry business. According to a report from Semafor, this potential partnership may represent a significant victory for Intel Foundry, which is actively seeking major customers.Industry analysts note that securing a large client like AMD will allow Intel Foundry to confidently invest in developing its manufacturing technology and would send a strong signal to other chip companies about Intel's capabilities.It will also signify that AMD, Intel’s biggest competitor in x86-based chips for PCs and servers, is confident in trusting its core manufacturing to its rival.Following the news, Intel shares rose 7% on Wednesday, while AMD shares were up over 1%. Intel's stock has seen a nearly 77% rise so far in 2025 as investors gain confidence in the chipmaker's turnaround efforts.AMD has responded to the report, calling them rumours.“AMD does not comment on rumor or speculation,” an AMD spokesperson stated.While the extent of the manufacturing AMD would shift to Intel remains unclear, it is to be noted that AMD currently relies on TSMC for its chip production.The news follows a series of positive developments for Intel in recent weeks, including securing significant investments from the US government, Nvidia and Softbank. These endorsements are widely seen as votes of confidence in Intel’s business strategy under CEO Lip-Bu Tan, though Nvidia did not commit to using Intel’s foundry services.","Report claims AMD is in early discussions with Intel to manufacture chips for AMD's products within Intel's foundry business.
