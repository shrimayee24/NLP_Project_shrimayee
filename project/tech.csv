NEW DELHI: Cracking down on deepfakes, the Centre has tightened India's digital rules by mandating compulsory labelling, traceability and user declarations for AI-generated content. It has also sharply cut timelines to take down unlawful content to as little as three hours from 36 hours and placed direct compliance responsibility on social media platforms and their senior officers.For the first time, AI-generated material, including deepfake videos, synthetic audio and manipulated visuals, has been brought under a formal regulatory framework through amendments to the IT intermediary rules. The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Amendment Rules, 2026 will come into force from Feb 20.The amended rules introduce a statutory definition of ""synthetically generated information"" (SGI).The new rules impose mandatory obligations on intermediaries to identify, label and trace AI content. All AI-generated or AI-altered material must carry a clear and prominent disclosure visible to users.Platforms must also embed persistent metadata and unique identifiers to enable traceability of the content’s origin and the tools used to create it. Once applied, these disclosures cannot be altered, hidden or removed.The rules exclude routine edits such as colour correction, noise reduction, compression or translation, as long as they do not change the meaning. Clearly hypothetical or illustrative drafts are exempt.Large social media platforms face stricter compliance requirements. Before any content goes live, platforms must ensure users declare if it is AI-generated. Intermediaries must deploy automated tools to verify these declarations by analysing the content’s format, source and characteristics. If content is identified as synthetic, visible labelling becomes mandatory. Platforms that knowingly allow unlabelled AI-generated content to remain online will be treated as having failed their due-diligence obligations.The rules also compress response timelines. Certain lawful takedown orders must now be complied with within three hours, compared to 36 hours earlier. Other deadlines have been tightened, with a 15-day window reduced to 7 days and a 24-hour window cut to 12 hours. Platforms must acknowledge user grievances within two hours and resolve them within seven days.Oversight and enforcement will rest with the ministry of electronics and information technology, while users can appeal platform decisions to the grievance appellate committee.Misuse of SGI linked to child sexual abuse material, obscene content, false electronic records, impersonation using a real person’s identity or voice, or explosives-related material will attract action under multiple criminal laws.Platforms must also warn users at least once every three months about penalties for misuse of AI-generated content.","The Centre has tightened India's digital rules by mandating compulsory labelling, traceability and user declarations for AI-generated content.

Apple iPhone 17e price (expected)

Apple is reportedly gearing up to announce the successor to last year’s iPhone 16e. Likely to be called iPhone 17e, the smartphone “is due imminently”, claims Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman in the latest edition of his weekly PowerOn newsletter. “Apple will market the 17e heavily to users in emerging economies and enterprises — two areas the company plans to target aggressively this year with both devices and software,” Gurman writes in the newsletter. He also shared that the phone will come with a few “big changes” that include iPhone 17’s A19 chipset and MagSafe charging, among others.The upcoming iPhone 17e, Gurman says will be powered by the A19 chip that comes with iPhone 17. The A19 offers a modest boost in CPU speed compared to the A18, but most of its improvement is in GPU, thus allowing it to be even better for AI features and gaming.Further, the handset is tipped to get MagSafe charging feature. Another change coming the iPhone 17e is that it may be equipped with Apple’s newest in-house cellular and wireless chips.Korean news outlet The Elec previously reported that the iPhone 17e is expected to feature slimmer display bezels while retaining the iPhone 14-era OLED panel. Other major new features include an 18MP front camera with Center Stage. This camera automatically extends to show everybody in a group selfie, even when you hold the phone vertically.As far as the pricing of the upcoming iPhone 17e is concerned, Gurman says that the company is planning to keep pricing the same as iPhone 16e. To recall, iPhone 16e launched in 2025 with a price tag of $599 or Rs 59,900 in India.","Apple is reportedly gearing up to announce the successor to last year’s iPhone 16e.

Korean 'Love Game' Under Lens After Ghaziabad Sisters Suicide Raises Alarm On Digital Addiction





GHAZIABAD: Police probing the alleged suicides of three sisters in Bharat City have recovered incremental data from a mobile phone sold by their father days before their deaths, finding that the girls spent almost 20 hours a day on the device watching Korean content, cartoons and gaming.The handset - picked up from an electronics shop in Shalimar Garden on Monday - also contains viewing and gaming material that the sisters listed in their suicide note last week, police said.The three sisters - aged 16, 14 and 12 - were found lying next to each other on the society's premises, directly below their ninth-floor window, on Feb 4. They were taken to hospital and declared dead on arrival.Police said that the phone was sold by their father, Chetan Kumar, to the Shalimar Garden shop for Rs 15,000 about 15 days before the incident. The device had been sent for forensic examination to retrieve deleted data and map the girls' online activity and contacts.An officer said the phones were central to establishing what the sisters were consuming online and whether they were in touch with anyone outside the family. Data recovered so far shows the sisters were heavily invested in Korean culture, with K-pop featuring most prominently.The cops also found material linked to games named in the suicide note, including the horror titles Poppy Playtime, The Baby in Yellow, Ice Cream Man, Evil Nun and Ice Game.Patil said police had already sent a report to govt seeking a ban on these five games.""A request was sent to govt to ban these five games. As of now, we are trying to recover the other phone that the girls' father had sold off three months ago. We also need to scan the social media activity of the girls,"" the officer said.The recovered phone's YouTube history also shows an extensive list of Korean and Chinese songs, police said. Apart from Korean drama and films, the girls watched Chinese, Thai and Japanese content. Gaming videos and cartoons also featured prominently, such as Doraemon, Shinchan, PJ Masks, Masha and the Bear, Shimmer and Shine and Peppa Pig.The sisters' increasing fixation with everything Korean has also drawn attention to their isolation and growing dependence on an online fantasy life. The girls had stopped going to school after Covid and had few, if any, friends, becoming increasingly dependent on each other and on their phones. They had also started a YouTube channel in 2025 focused on K-dramas and cartoon characters, which grew to more than 2,000 followers, but was deleted about 10 days before their alleged suicides.The channel, police said, was removed after their father objected to their escalating obsession with Korean culture.A private tutor, who taught them briefly, also told police and family members that the girls introduced themselves to her with Korean names - Maria, Aliza and Cindy - and claimed they had been adopted from Korea and China.""They were very weak in studies. When I gave them basic calculations, like additions and multiplications, they failed to even recognise numbers. When I asked them about their Korean names, they said they had been adopted from China and Korea. I asked their father about it. He told me about their obsession,"" said the tutor, who stopped teaching them after a few sessions.It was around six months ago that Kumar had bought two phones for the eldest daughter and her 14-year-old half-sister, believing they would become ""famous like YouTubers"". He sold one of the phones three months ago, and the other one just 15 days before the suicides.","Police investigating alleged suicides of three sisters in Ghaziabad recovered data from a sold mobile phone, revealing extensive daily use for Korean content, cartoons, and gaming.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

YouTube Music faces backlash after making song lyrics a premium-only feature,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/youtube-music-faces-backlash-after-making-song-lyrics-a-premium-only-feature/articleshow/128174134.cms,"Image Via YouTube

YouTube Music limits free song lyrics to push premium subscriptions





YouTube Music has upset many users after changing how song lyrics work on its app. Earlier, lyrics were free for everyone. Now, free users can only read lyrics for a limited time before they are blocked. This change has prompted dissatisfaction among listeners who love to read song lyrics as they listen. This discontent comes from users’ perception that this move removes a basic feature that assists them in enjoying their favorite music better. The move has also prompted discussion about how much music apps should charge for their features.The update enables free users to view scrollable lyrics for just the first five songs they play. After that limit is reached, the lyrics become blurred and unreadable. To continue seeing lyrics, users must subscribe to YouTube Music Premium, which costs $10.99 per month. The change rolled out widely in early February after being tested with a smaller group of users. A pop-up now appears in the app, showing a countdown of how many free lyric views remain.This move has added to growing criticism of music streaming platforms.While YouTube Music offers free access to songs with ads, many users believe lyrics should remain a basic feature. Lyrics help listeners sing along, learn new languages, and better understand songs. By limiting access, YouTube Music appears to be encouraging users to upgrade to its paid plan rather than improving the free experience.Not all people have the same experience, as some report that they do not usually refer to the lyrics and can get along fine as usual. Some also note that not all songs included in the popular site do have their lyrics available. Despite the various perceptions regarding the change, many regard the change as unnecessary, which according to some, is unfriendly to some of the regular users. This change happens at a time when the service is facing criticism.It is still not clear whether YouTube Music intends to revisit their decision. For now, the limitation on access to lyrics for free users is active. They must weigh their choices between using this service with the limitation and having Premium. Of course, competition between music streaming services can easily depend on their management of basic elements like lyrics.","YouTube Music has changed how song lyrics work on its app. Earlier, lyrics were free for everyone.

Twitch’s new pause-screen ads draw criticism from viewers and streamers





Twitch is introducing a new kind of advertisement that will appear when the stream is paused. Advertising was one of the main ways for streamers to earn money on Twitch, though it sometimes resulted in a loss for the viewers who missed important parts of the stream. Viewers who want to avoid these interruptions can sign up for Twitch Prime or Turbo; however, not all may afford these services. There have already been complaints over the new kind of advertisement from both the viewers and the streamers themselves who claim that this may adversely affect the streaming service.The new ads will show up whenever someone pauses a stream, even if they step away from the screen. Twitch announced this update on February 10, 2026, saying it is part of an experiment calledThe company also noted that skippable ads are still being tested at the same time. While the goal is to make ads less intrusive, many users have expressed frustration, saying ads while paused could cause viewers to fall behind the live stream or disrupt their viewing habits.Many people have expressed their concerns about the new change through various social media posts. There was even criticism that people may become irritated since pausing a video might be used for quick look-up of information, and the ads might interfere with the pause.Hence, people may stop using the site. The prominent Twitch streamers have also expressed their own concerns that the new ads may interfere with the viewing experience and be detrimental to the streamers.Although there is a backlash, the platform asserts that the test is intended to generate additional earnings for the streamer without totally disrupting the stream. It is said that the ads will only be shown while the stream is paused, thus the streaming will still be conducted at the back of the screen.Ultimately, the new ads that will appear while the viewer has their Twitch video paused serve as a prime example of the constantly ongoing issue of finding the right balance in the name of generating more income without making the user experience suffer as a result. While the streamer derives the intended benefits from such a feature, the viewer base nonetheless has legitimate issues with the overall experience.","The new ads will show up whenever someone pauses a stream, even if they step away from the screen.

"Mysterious tunnels found beneath 5,000-year-old pagan graves in Germany leave experts stunned",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/mysterious-tunnels-found-beneath-5000-year-old-pagan-graves-in-germany-leave-experts-stunned/articleshow/128133862.cms,"Where the tunnels were found

What was found inside the tunnel





Archaeologists in Germany have uncovered a narrow medieval tunnel system hidden beneath a much older pagan burial site, a discovery that has surprised experts and raised new questions about how different eras interacted with the same landscape. The find was announced in a January 29 press release by the State Office for Heritage Management and Archaeology of Saxony-Anhalt, following excavations near Reinstedt. While the graves date back roughly 5,000 years to the Neolithic period, the underground passage was dug thousands of years later, during the late Middle Ages, creating a rare overlap of prehistoric and medieval activity at a single site.The tunnels were found within a Middle Neolithic burial complex associated with the Baalberge culture, which flourished in the 4th millennium BC. The site consists of a large ditch enclosure and several poorly preserved burials that were originally used for ritual and funerary purposes. Excavations were carried out ahead of planned wind turbine construction, a routine process in Germany that often precedes large infrastructure projects.Archaeologists initially believed they were uncovering a grave after encountering a trapezoidal pit and a stone slab at one end.Further excavation revealed that the feature continued downward into the loess subsoil and was in fact an erdstall, a narrow underground tunnel system typically dated to the late Middle Ages. Erdstalls are found in parts of Central Europe, but their purpose has long remained unclear.The underground passage contained late medieval pottery, an iron horseshoe, animal remains, numerous stones and traces of charcoal from a brief fire. At the narrowest point of the entrance, archaeologists found larger stones stacked together, suggesting the tunnel was intentionally sealed. These finds confirmed that the structure was man-made, used for a period of time, and deliberately closed.The most striking aspect of the discovery is its location. Medieval builders chose to dig the tunnel directly beneath a prehistoric pagan burial site, a decision that archaeologists say was unlikely to be accidental. One theory is that the ancient earthworks were still visible in the Middle Ages and provided a convenient landmark. Another possibility is cultural: medieval Christian communities may have avoided disturbing pagan graves, making such sites discreet places for hidden structures.The function of erdstalls remains debated. Scholars have suggested they may have served as temporary hiding places, storage spaces, or sites for ritual or cultic activity. The narrow dimensions of the Reinstedt tunnel and the limited evidence of long-term occupation support the idea of short-term or episodic use, rather than permanent habitation.","Archaeologists in Germany have uncovered a narrow medieval tunnel system hidden beneath a much older pagan burial site.

Greenland crisis boosted Danish apps designed to identify and help boycott US goods,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/greenland-crisis-boosted-danish-apps-designed-to-identify-and-help-boycott-us-goods/articleshow/128064201.cms,"AP file photo

Canada, Greenland Show Of Power Amid Trump's ‘Invasion’ Storm; 'Difficult Times Are...'





The makers of mobile apps designed to help shoppers identify and boycott American goods say they saw a surge of interest in Denmark and beyond after the recent flare-up in tensions over U.S. President Donald Trump's designs on Greenland.The creator of the ""Made O'Meter"" app, Ian Rosenfeldt, said he saw around 30,000 downloads of the free app in just three days at the height of the trans-Atlantic diplomatic crisis in late January out of more than 100,000 since it was launched in March.Apps offer practical help Rosenfeldt, who lives in Copenhagen and works in digital marketing, decided to create the app a year ago after joining a Facebook group of like-minded Danes hoping to boycott U.S. goods.""Many people were frustrated and thinking, 'How do we actually do this in practical terms,'"" the 53-year-old recalled. ""If you use a bar code scanner, it's difficult to see if a product is actually American or not, if it's Danish or not. And if you don't know that, you can't really make a conscious choice.""The latest version of ""Made O'Meter"" uses artificial intelligence to identify and analyze several products at a time, then recommend similar European-made alternatives.Users can set preferences, like ""No USA-owned brands"" or ""Only EU-based brands."" The app claims over 95% accuracy.""By using artificial intelligence, you can take an image of a product ... and it can make a deep dive to go out and find the correct information about the product in many levels,"" Rosenfeldt told The Associated Press during a demonstration at a Copenhagen grocery store. ""This way, you have information that you can use to take decisions on what you think is right.""'Losing an ally' After an initial surge of downloads when the app was launched, usage tailed off. Until last month, when Trump stepped up his rhetoric about the need for the U.S. to acquire Greenland, a strategically important and mineral-rich Arctic island that is a semiautonomous territory of Denmark.Usage peaked Jan. 23, when there were almost 40,000 scans in one day, compared with 500 or so daily last summer. It has dropped back since but there were still around 5,000 a day this week, said Rosenfeldt, who noted ""Made O'Meter"" is used by over 20,000 people in Denmark but also by people in Germany, Spain, Italy, even Venezuela.""It's become much more personal,"" said Rosenfeldt, who spoke of ""losing an ally and a friend.""Trump announced in January he would slap new tariffs on Denmark and seven other European countries that opposed his takeover calls, only to abruptly drop his threats after he said a ""framework"" for a deal over access to mineral-rich Greenland was reached with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte's help. Few details of that agreement have emerged.The U.S. began technical talks in late January to put together an Arctic security deal with Denmark and Greenland, which say sovereignty is not negotiable.Rosenfeldt knows such boycotts won't damage the U.S. economy, but hopes to send a message to supermarkets and encourage greater reliance on European producers.""Maybe we can send a signal and people will listen and we can make a change,"" he added.The protest may be largely symbolic Another Danish app, ""NonUSA,"" topped 100,000 downloads at the beginning of February. One of its creators, 21-year-old Jonas Pipper, said there were over 25,000 downloads Jan. 21, when 526 product scans were performed in a minute at one point. Of the users, some 46,000 are in Denmark and around 10,000 in Germany.""We noticed some users saying they felt like a little bit of the pressure was lifted off them,"" Pipper said. ""They feel like they kind of gained the power back in this situation.""It's questionable whether such apps will have much practical effect.Christina Gravert, an associate professor of economics at the University of Copenhagen, said there are actually few U.S. products on Danish grocery store shelves, ""around 1 to 3%"". Nuts, wines and candy, for example. But there is widespread use of American technology in Denmark, from Apple iPhones to Microsoft Office tools.""If you really want to have an impact, that's where you should start,"" she said.Even ""Made O'Meter"" and ""NonUSA"" are downloaded from Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store.Gravert, who specializes in behavioral economics, said such boycott campaigns are usually short-lived and real change often requires an organized effort rather than individual consumers.""It can be interesting for big supermarket brands to say, OK, we're not going to carry these products anymore because consumers don't want to buy them,"" she said. ""If you think about large companies, this might have some type of impact on the import (they) do.""On a recent morning, shoppers leaving one Copenhagen grocery store were divided.""We do boycott, but we don't know all the American goods. So, it's mostly the well-known trademarks,"" said Morten Nielsen, 68, a retired navy officer. ""It's a personal feeling ... we feel we do something, I know we are not doing very much.""""I love America, I love traveling in America,"" said 63-year-old retiree Charlotte Fuglsang.

Supply chain mechanics

Failed crackdowns





A man, while surfing his regular channel for adult content, found himself on the website. On screen, he saw the quality time he had spent with his girlfriend in a hotel in China's Shenzhen three weeks ago.This incident sparked an investigation into China's spy-cam porn industry, exposing how the genre, heavily fueled by the voyeuristic audience, has been operating a sophisticated network of hidden cameras, livestreams, and paid subscriptions that exploit hotel guests nationwide.A report by BBC World Service found evidence of a structured industry involving multiple actors, including installers, “camera owners”, agents, and online distributors. The content is promoted on Telegram, a channel banned in China, while higher-level operators reportedly manage camera installations and streaming infrastructure.One of the Telegram channels, managed by an agent named 'AKA' had up to 10,000 members and was promoting access to over 180 hotel-room spy-cams livestreaming intimate moments to paying consumers for fees of around 450 Yuan monthly.Subscribers were able to select from multiple feeds, which are triggered immediately after the hotel guests put their key cards in.The website also had the options to rewind footage, download clips from the archives and a chatroom.In a period of seven months, 54 cameras were identified (half active), potentially capturing thousands of unaware guests based on occupancy rates.Operators install miniature hidden cameras, sometimes as small as a pencil eraser, inside hotel fixtures such as ventilation units, wiring them directly into the building’s power supply. The agents operate as intermediaries for “camera owners”, who are believed to oversee both the physical installation of devices and the running of the online platforms.Platform archives examined in the probe contained more than 6,000 edited clips dating back to 2017, and when one camera in a Zhengzhou hotel was discovered and removed, a replacement feed was activated within hours.Although regulations introduced in April 2025 require hotels to conduct routine inspections for hidden cameras, investigators were still able to identify thousands of newly uploaded videos on six different platforms over an 18‑month period.Law enforcement cases appear scattered across multiple provinces, but experts say the sustained demand for “raw”, non-consensual footage continues to drive the market, and tests show that many commercially available camera detectors fail to identify professionally concealed devices.","Investigation into China's spy-cam porn industry exposes sophisticated network of hidden cameras, livestreams, and paid subscriptions. 54 cameras were identified (half active), potentially capturing thousands of unaware guests based on occupancy rates.

UAE new speed rules are live: Abu Dhabi quietly slashes limits on 3 key roads,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-new-speed-rules-are-live-abu-dhabi-quietly-slashes-limits-on-3-key-roads/articleshow/128143753.cms,"Fines Incoming? Abu Dhabi’s Speed Limit Shake-Up Explained

What’s changed: The new speed limits in Abu Dhabi



Abu Dhabi–Al Ain Road (E22): The speed limit between the Al Nahda Interchange and Baniyas Interchange has dropped from 160 km/h to 140 km/h, and from 140 km/h to 120 km/h for another stretch between Baniyas Interchange and before the Bridges Complex.

Connecting the Musaffah area with Mohammed bin Zayed City, this road now has a speed limit of 100 km/h, down from 120 km/h previously. Another section of E22 has also seen consistent reductions.

Why the change? Road safety at the core of Abu Dhabi



Abu Dhabi Reduces Speed Limits on Key Roads for Enhanced Safety

Part of a wider traffic safety trend in Abu Dhabi



Abu Dhabi's New Speed Limits: Safer Roads or Just More Fines?

What Abu Dhabi's new speed limits mean for drivers



Adjust Your Driving Habits: Drivers must be aware of the new limits and adjust their speedometers accordingly. Tools like GPS apps may take time to update in real time, so authorities insist motorists follow posted signs rather than defaults on navigation systems.

Drivers must be aware of the new limits and adjust their speedometers accordingly. Tools like apps may take time to update in real time, so authorities insist motorists follow posted signs rather than defaults on navigation systems. Increased Enforcement: With updated limits, radar systems and speed cameras are being retuned, and traffic enforcement units have signalled strict monitoring and penalties for violations. That can include fines and black points, especially in areas where previous patterns showed high violation and crash rates.

With updated limits, radar systems and speed cameras are being retuned, and traffic enforcement units have signalled strict monitoring and penalties for violations. That can include fines and black points, especially in areas where previous patterns showed high violation and crash rates. Safer Roads Ahead (If Compliance Improves): Research in other urban environments shows that moderate speed limits combined with enforcement and driver awareness reduce both fatal and serious collisions (e.g., studies correlating speed reductions to safety outcomes in roadway management literature). While a UAE-specific academic study on speed effects is pending, broader analysis supports this principle in traffic safety planning.





In a bold push to improve road safety and reduce traffic collisions, the Joint Traffic Safety Committee in Abu Dhabi has rolled out new reduced speed limits on three of the emirate’s busiest roads. The updated regulations, which took effect on February 09, 2026, mark the latest in a series of transport reforms designed to curb high-speed accidents and make daily commutes safer for all motorists.Here’s a comprehensive look at what’s changed, why authorities acted and what drivers need to know going forward.Under the new rules, authorities have lowered posted speed limits by 20 km/h on three major road corridors in Abu Dhabi -All reductions apply in both directions and are now enforceable. Motorists have been urged to adhere strictly to the updated limits for their own safety and that of other road users.Authorities say the revisions are part of a broader safety strategy aimed at lowering crash rates and protecting both commuters and vulnerable road users. Abu Dhabi has seen increasing vehicle volumes in recent years and data show that high-speed collisions remain one of the biggest contributors to fatal and serious injury crashes nationally.Earlier variable speed limit systems trialled in Abu Dhabi, which adjust limits in real time based on weather, congestion or accidents, demonstrated that lower speeds correlate with improved safety outcomes and smoother traffic flow during hazardous conditions like fog or peak hours.By standardising lower maximum speeds across key motorways, traffic authorities aim to reduce the stopping distances required at higher speeds, a key factor in both accident severity and frequency.Abu Dhabi’s new speed limits are not isolated. Across the UAE, authorities have been steadily updating road rules to prioritise safety. In October 2025, Abu Dhabi introduced a variable speed limit system on Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Road, using digital signage to lower limits automatically during bad weather, traffic peaks or incident response situations.On other major routes, authorities have previously reduced maximum limits, for example on Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed International Road (E11) and Sweihan Road (E20), to clear safety thresholds. The emirate also abolished a minimum 120 km/h speed requirement on Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Road (E311) to improve safety and traffic harmony.In addition, Abu Dhabi has implemented truck movement restrictions on certain roads to reduce congestion and collision risk during peak hours (e.g., banning truck movement on E11 and E10). Together, these measures position Abu Dhabi as one of the most proactive emirates in the UAE for road safety regulation, blending traditional fixed limits with dynamic and context-sensitive systems.These changes come amid a broader UAE push to reduce road deaths and injuries, a priority for both traffic authorities and policymakers. Previous federal law reforms included stricter penalties for reckless behaviours, including unsafe overtaking and unsafe lane changes, aimed at reducing crash causation factors.Multiple emirates, including Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah, have also adjusted limits on certain urban roads to enhance safety. The message from authorities is clear that the speed management is central to saving lives on the road and static limits alone are not enough without consistent enforcement, driver education and infrastructure adaptation.Given how traffic authorities have rolled out dynamic limit adjustments, truck bans and variable signage, the future of road safety in Abu Dhabi could include expanded real-time speed management systems on more highways and intercity roads, integration of congestion and crash data into planning to fine-tune enforcement and limit calibration and broader road safety campaigns to align public understanding with regulatory goals.Abu Dhabi’s new speed limit reductions on three major roads, trimming limits by 20 km/h, are part of a wider and multi-pronged effort to improve road safety and traffic flow as the emirate’s population and vehicle numbers grow. For drivers, it means adjusting speed habits, understanding variable signage where deployed and staying aware that road safety regulations are evolving rapidly, not just locally but across the UAE, to match modern mobility challenges.",Authorities have lowered posted speed limits by 20 km/h on three major road corridors in Abu Dhabi. All reductions apply in both directions and are now enforceable. Motorists have been urged to adhere strictly to the updated limits for their own safety and that of other road users.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128155730,imgsize-52874,width-400,resizemode-4/fines-incoming-abu-dhabis-speed-limit-shake-up-explained.jpg"
What is Dubai’s Global Village passport?

A souvenir designed like a world tour





How it works and where to get it





What it is not





Why it has become so popular









At first glance, it looks like a real passport. In reality, the Dubai’s Global Village passport is a playful souvenir that turns a night out into a miniature journey around the world. Sold inside Global Village, the booklet has become a favourite among families, children, and anyone who enjoys collecting memories rather than magnets.So what exactly is it, and why do so many visitors make it part of their visit?The Global Village passport is a small, themed booklet created as a keepsake for guests exploring the park’s more than 30 international pavilions. Each pavilion represents a different country or region, and each has its own custom stamp. As visitors move from one pavilion to the next, they can add a stamp to their booklet, slowly filling the pages with colourful impressions.The idea is simple. Walk, explore, stamp, repeat. By the end of the visit, the passport becomes a personal record of how many cultures you have “visited” in one evening.The passport is priced at around AED 10 and is usually available at ticket counters or information desks near the entrance.Once inside, guests carry it with them and use stamp stations or machines located at participating pavilions. Countries such as India, Turkey and African pavilions are among those typically featured, with one stamp per pavilion.With roughly 30 pavilions each season, completing the entire booklet is seen as a small achievement, especially for younger visitors.Despite its name and design, the Global Village passport has no official or legal use. It is not a travel document, entry ticket, or visa substitute. Visitors still need a regular Global Village entry ticket, which usually starts at around AED 25 when purchased online.In previous seasons, there was a separate promotional activity involving real passports and free entry stamps, but that campaign is not connected to the souvenir booklet.For many visitors, the appeal lies in its simplicity. It adds a game-like challenge to the visit, encourages exploration of every pavilion, and serves as a lightweight, affordable keepsake. More than anything, it captures the spirit of Global Village by turning one evening into a journey across cultures, neatly stamped page by page.","Dubai's Global Village passport lets visitors collect pavilion stamps.

Looking ahead: Education and sustainable growth through Al Dhaid Wildlife Museum







In a significant cultural and educational milestone for the UAE’s central region, his highness Sheikh Dr Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah, inaugurated the Al Dhaid Wildlife Museum in Al Dhaid City, reinforcing the emirate’s long-term vision for environmental stewardship and public engagement with nature.Officially opened adjacent to the historic Souq Sharia’t Al Dhaid, the museum represents a qualitative addition to Sharjah’s growing network of educational and conservation-focused destinations. Its launch follows a broader transformation of Al Dhaid into a multi-faceted region where heritage, nature and community life intersect.The Wildlife Museum has been intentionally designed as an interactive and educational platform that invites families, students, researchers and nature enthusiasts to explore the rich biodiversity and ecological dynamics of the Arabian desert landscape.Spanning several specialised halls, exhibits cover a wide range of natural topics, from desert animal adaptations and plant life to geological formations and seasonal cycles. One notable feature includes a three-dimensional model of desert fauna anatomy, designed to deepen visitors’ understanding of how species thrive in harsh environments.By deploying advanced digital technologies and interactive learning tools, the museum aims to make environmental science accessible and engaging.This aligns with an emerging trend across the Gulf of blending technology with natural history to attract younger audiences and bolster public science literacy.During the inauguration speech, the Ruler emphasised the importance of sustained scientific work to preserve local ecosystems and wildlife, reaffirming Sharjah’s ongoing commitment to conservation efforts. These efforts extend beyond museum walls. For example, long-term projects such as seed collection and storage initiatives, including multi-million seed banks, reflect broader strategies to protect plant diversity and support scientific research.By featuring educational laboratories and dedicated spaces for research within the museum, the institution is positioned not only as a destination for visitors, but as a learning hub for scholars and environmental professionals. It supports initiatives that promote ecological understanding and sustainable development, which are values increasingly central to national agendas across the UAE.Spanning 2,755 square metres, the museum is thoughtfully designed with a series of specialised halls that explore the Arabian desert’s unique environment, the ways life adapts to its challenging conditions, and the rich biodiversity of plant and animal species that thrive within it.The museum’s main entrance reflects traditional Emirati architecture of the central region, featuring an arched gateway reminiscent of historic forts and heritage buildings. This design serves as a symbolic passage into a space dedicated to culture, knowledge, and environmental awareness.The earth-toned façade blends seamlessly with the surrounding desert landscape, while the hand-carved wooden gate, adorned with Islamic-inspired motifs, adds a sense of craftsmanship and authenticity. Together, these elements present a contemporary architectural expression rooted in Emirati identity and memory of place.Supporting its scientific and educational mission, the museum is equipped with a comprehensive range of facilities. These include administrative offices, dedicated spaces for scientific researchers, a fully equipped laboratory and a technical support department. Additional facilities include offices for environmental education, a programmes and activities department, a guidance unit and visitor services such as parking and support amenities.The opening of the Wildlife Museum forms part of a larger effort to reposition Al Dhaid as a destination that celebrates both its natural environment and its historical roots. Alongside the museum, restorations and new attractions are enhancing the region’s cultural circuit, bringing heritage tourism into harmony with environmental exploration.This initiative runs parallel to the restoration of historic structures and marketplaces, which collectively offer a layered visitor experience, from traditional architecture and souq culture to immersive encounters with nature. Such developments support wider sustainability narratives in the UAE, where environmental conservation, cultural preservation and community engagement are increasingly integrated into urban and regional planning.The Al Dhaid Wildlife Museum highlights how cultural institutions are evolving to serve multiple roles as centres for public education, platforms for scientific collaboration and anchors for tourism development. By promoting ecological awareness through interactive experiences and scientific engagement, the museum not only reflects Sharjah’s heritage but helps shape a future generation of environmentally conscious citizens.As the museum opens its doors, it stands as a testament to how investments in environmental education can deepen public appreciation of nature while advancing broader cultural and developmental goals across the UAE.","Al Dhaid Wildlife Museum is a hub for interactive environmental learning in Sharjah.

Why fragrance matters more during Ramadan in the Gulf



Ramadan's Secret Weapon: How Gulf Men Are Using Scent to Make a Statement in 2026





As Ramadan 2026 settles in, scent is once again taking centre stage across the Gulf. Far beyond a grooming afterthought, fragrance during the holy month is a quiet marker of identity and are worn for evening prayers, family iftars and the social rhythms that lead into Eid. This year’s Arabic cologne trends reflect a deeper return to heritage notes, layered with modern sensibilities and long-lasting compositions designed for reflective nights and festive gatherings.Deep, smoky woods continue to dominate Ramadan fragrance preferences. Oud-inspired compositions that are rich, resinous and unapologetically bold, remain a cultural staple, particularly for evening wear. These scents often unfold slowly, starting dense and powerful before settling into warm, grounding bases that linger for hours.For many men, woody fragrances feel intrinsically tied to Ramadan nights as they are dignified, spiritual and deeply comforting. Their longevity makes them ideal for long taraweeh prayers and extended family gatherings, where subtle presence matters more than projection.Amber-forward fragrances are seeing renewed popularity this season, prized for their soft warmth and enveloping character. These colognes often blend sweet resins with balsamic undertones, creating a scent profile that feels intimate rather than overpowering.Perfect for Ramadan evenings, amber scents evoke a sense of calm and contemplation, aligning naturally with the month’s reflective mood. They are especially favoured by men who want something rich yet restrained, offering depth without heaviness.For those who prefer their fragrance to make a statement, spicy oriental profiles are trending strongly in 2026. Think warm spices layered over dark woods and subtle sweetness as fragrances that feel celebratory and confident.These colognes are often chosen for post-iftar socialising and Eid gatherings, where boldness feels appropriate. The spice notes add energy, while the oriental base ensures the scent remains grounded and culturally resonant.A newer category gaining traction blends freshness with traditional depth. These fragrances typically open with citrus or aromatic notes before transitioning into woody or musky bases. The result is a cleaner, lighter take on Arabic perfumery, which is ideal for daytime fasting hours or warmer evenings.This hybrid style appeals to younger wearers and those seeking versatility: fragrances that move seamlessly from mosque visits to casual gatherings without feeling too heavy.Musk-based colognes, often paired with soft leather nuances, are emerging as understated favourites this Ramadan. These scents sit closer to the skin, offering a personal rather than performative presence.Favoured for their elegance and restraint, musky profiles align well with the quieter, inward focus of the holy month. They are particularly popular among men who prefer a refined signature scent that does not announce itself loudly but leaves a lasting impression.Across categories, one theme is clear: performance and emotional resonance matter more than novelty. Men are gravitating towards scents that last through long evenings, feel appropriate for spiritual settings and carry a sense of cultural familiarity.In Ramadan 2026, Arabic colognes are less about chasing trends and more about honouring moments, from silent prayers to joyful Eid embraces.

Shahi Tharoor’s thoughts on reading, children and AI





Dubai’s vibrant literary scene was abuzz recently as Shashi Tharoor , Indian politician, author and former diplomat, delivered a memorable session at the Emirates Literature Festival, one of the Middle East’s premier cultural events celebrating books, ideas and global literary voices. Held annually under the patronage of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and organised by the Emirates Literature Foundation, the festival draws hundreds of speakers and thousands of readers from around the world.The 2026 edition featured more than 200 speakers from over 40 countries, bringing a mix of fiction, non-fiction, Arabic literature, poetry, performance and discussion to Dubai audiences.Tharoor’s session, titled A Wonderland of Words, also the name of his latest book, quickly became a highlight of the festival. Unlike typical lectures, his appearance blended humour, personal anecdotes and linguistic insight in a talk that felt more like an intimate conversation than a formal presentation.Moderated by British presenter Amandeep Bhangu, the session focused on how language shapes thought, culture and connection, drawing laughter and reflection in equal measure. Tharoor described his book as a series of short, reflective bursts rather than dense arguments, “bite-sized chapters, ideal for dipping in and out”, a format that felt like a quiet validation of modern reading habits.However, the real charm of the session lay in how effortlessly he braided the personal with the public, tracing his lifelong love of language back to his father, who taught himself English through persistence and curiosity rather than polish. Arriving in London and recognising the limits of his learning, his father began filling notebooks with quotations from Byron, Shakespeare and Dickens, not to impress but out of sheer delight in words.He revealed that back home, language was treated like a game: Scrabble before it was fashionable, word-building challenges where Tharoor admitted he “usually won” and even a homemade, pre-digital precursor to Wordle that allowed 20 guesses and offered no clues. Yet beneath the playfulness of his father was emotional precision, a man who wrote letters so moving that people remembered them long after his passing, whether for moments of grief, joy or setback.From him, Tharoor learned that words are not decorative flourishes but exact instruments, a pleasure in themselves and powerful because of what they can carry.Tharoor traced his fascination with language to his father’s passionate approach to English, recalling how notebooks full of quotations and impromptu wordplay games shaped his early years. “You don’t really choose a language, a language chooses you through the circumstances of your life,” he told the audience, capturing the personal, almost serendipitous nature of linguistic affinity.He also tackled the stereotype of his own “difficult vocabulary,” underscoring that words should serve clarity and connection, not confusion. “I unfortunately have an undeserved reputation for difficult words. I use the most appropriate words for what I’m trying to convey. If I can’t convey my thoughts to the audience, I’m a poor communicator. I use language to get my message across, not to confuse or impress,” he said to applause.Tharoor’s playful side surfaced in anecdotes about English eccentricities, like explanations of humorous linguistic terms and the cultural quirks of borrowing words across languages. Dubai, a global crossroads where multilingual communication is part of daily life, provided a fitting backdrop for Tharoor’s reflections on language and identity.His remarks on how English interacts with other languages and cultural contexts resonated with an audience intimately familiar with linguistic blending across communities. Quoting Nelson Mandela’s famous insight that speaking in someone’s language reaches the mind, while speaking in their own language reaches the heart, Tharoor highlighted the emotional power embedded in words and communication.In a Q&A segment, Tharoor urged parents and readers to model lifelong reading for children, asking whether they read themselves before encouraging others to read. He also warned against over-reliance on artificial intelligence in writing, stressing that outsourcing thought can dilute individuality and creative voice.Tharoor’s session exemplified the broader ethos of the Emirates Literature Festival, a belief in the transformative power of books and discussion to spur curiosity, understanding and cross-cultural exchange. Each year, the festival brings a mix of authors, thinkers and artists to Dubai, offering everything from panels and workshops to performances and interactive discussions. Its inclusive programming has helped position the city as a major cultural hub in the region.Tharoor’s appearance in Dubai was more than a book talk; it was a reminder of language’s enduring influence in an era dominated by rapid communication, digital media and global diversity. In blending personal narrative, linguistic curiosity and cultural observation, he offered the audience both entertainment and reflection. These are the qualities that make literature festivals more than mere gatherings but platforms for collective imagination and dialogue.","Shashi Tharoor is an Indian politician, author and former diplomat.

Buying luxury property in Dubai just got easier: How buyers can win big in market of high-end homes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/buying-luxury-property-in-dubai-just-got-easier-how-buyers-can-win-big-in-market-of-high-end-homes/articleshow/128065061.cms,"Dubai’s Luxury Property Market Is Crowded: Here’s How Smart Buyers Are Still Winning Big

Million-Dirham Decisions Made Simple: The Tool Luxury Buyers in Dubai Are Quietly Using

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Dubai’s ultra-luxury property segment, including homes priced above Dh20 million, remains one of the hottest real estate markets globally, drawing affluent local and international investors alike. However, while listing volumes are high, identifying the right inventory with real market value and credibility can still be challenging.With hundreds of luxury transactions recorded annually, including more than 750 properties above Dh50m and over 250 valued above Dh100m in 2025 alone, the challenge for affluent buyers is not just seeing inventory but identifying the right opportunities backed by real market behaviour. Platforms like Bayut are simplifying this process with data-led tools, verified listings and specialist agent networks designed to empower discerning buyers.Instead of simply providing endless listings, Bayut focuses on three core pillars of data insights, verified availability and expert partnerships to help buyers separate signal from noise in a dynamic market environment.One of the biggest challenges for luxury buyers is knowing whether a listed price reflects actual market activity rather than wishful thinking.Bayut tackles this by offering transaction-backed insights, drawing on official Dubai Land Department (DLD) records, so that buyers can see what similar properties are really achieving in terms of sales volume and pricing.In 2025, Dubai recorded thousands of high-value property sales, including more than 750 transactions for properties above Dh50 million and over 250 above Dh100 million, underscoring both demand and the need for accurate context. This type of benchmark pricing helps buyers understand if a property is competitively priced, overpriced, or a rare value play — a crucial step before making multi-million-dirham commitments.Luxury real estate is not just about price tags, it is about deep market knowledge, negotiation experience and access to exclusive opportunities. Bayut’s ecosystem highlights specialist agents with proven track records in high-value transactions, rather than generalists who may be active across all segments.Programs like TruBroker, Bayut’s quality standard for agent credibility, help buyers identify intermediaries who are consistent, data-savvy and focused on premium markets. This makes it easier to form partnerships with professionals who understand how to position offers, anticipate buyer preferences and secure coveted properties.Luxury inventory, especially at the very top end, can be distorted by outdated listings, duplicate posts or units that are no longer available. Bayut’s technology emphasises verified listings through tools like TruCheck and cross-referencing with systems like DLD’s Madmoun to ensure that a property you’re considering is truly active and not a relic of old marketing efforts.This verification helps buyers avoid wasted time and misaligned expectations, accelerating decision-making and reducing friction in negotiations.Luxury buyers also benefit from tools that help them evaluate whether asking prices make sense relative to market benchmarks. Bayut’s TruEstimate offers valuation estimates, historical price movement analysis and demand indicators that serve as a sense check for where a property stands, helping buyers discern possible overpricing or hidden opportunity without removing the emotional appeal of design or location.Such analytical signals are especially valuable in a segment where architectural uniqueness or waterfront views can command premium pricing that may not be immediately intuitive.High-end property purchases often emerge from long-term observation rather than last-minute decisions. Features like portfolio tracking (where buyers can keep an eye on pricing trends, status shifts and comparisons across multiple shortlisted properties), give investors a structured way to monitor the market over time, rather than making impulsive choices.This kind of forward-looking visibility keeps serious buyers informed about pricing shifts, new inventory that enters the high-end space, and when timing might be right to make a move. As Dubai continues to attract wealthy buyers from Europe, Asia and the Gulf with significant activity in places like Palm Jumeirah, Dubai Hills Estate and Mohammed Bin Rashid City, the need for clarity and confidence in property selection has never been greater.Bayut’s combination of transaction-backed data, verification, specialist networks and valuation insights positions it not just as a listing portal but as a trusted guide through one of the world’s most dynamic luxury markets. In an era where information overload can mislead as easily as it informs, access to accurate data, specialised expertise and transparent tools helps buyers make smarter and more efficient decisions, whether they are picking a trophy asset or a strategic long-term investment.","Dubai’s ultra-luxury property segment, including homes priced above Dh20 million, remains one of the hottest real estate markets globally.

Dubai’s iconic coastline is undergoing one of its most ambitious transformations in years, with major beach development projects already underway and more planned through the Blue and Green Spaces 2030 Roadmap unveiled at the World Governments Summit 2026. These changes are set to reshape how residents and tourists experience Dubai’s shores, from innovative night swimming options and panoramic ocean views to entirely new “all-season” beach destinations.At the heart of this coastal evolution is Dubai Municipality’s master plan to increase public beach length from roughly 21 km to 105 km, expand facilities by up to 400% and boost recreational infrastructure, all aligned with the emirate’s broader urban lifestyle and tourism strategy.One of the most eagerly awaited upgrades is at Jumeirah Beach 1, where redevelopment is now nearly complete and official opening is expected imminently. The project has expanded the beach by about 50% and integrates new cycling, jogging and pedestrian paths alongside modern amenities such as smart lockers, Wi-Fi, AI-enhanced safety systems and climate-resilient design features.These enhancements aim not only to support active lifestyles but also to future-proof the beach against environmental pressures, with significant sand nourishment and coastal protection measures engineered into the master plan.Another major pillar of Dubai’s seaside reinvention is Al Mamzar Beach Corniche. Part of a Dh355 million redevelopment programme, the corniche will feature a 200-metre floating pedestrian bridge, the first of its kind in Dubai, connecting both sides of the beach and offering new waterfront perspectives and viewing points.The project also expands walking, running and cycling tracks, enhances public services and includes dedicated areas for active recreation, leisure dining and wellness. A 125,000 sqm women-only beach area with secure entry and tailored amenities, including children’s play zones and night swimming opportunities, will also be introduced.Night swimming has already proven wildly popular at existing beaches such as Jumeirah 2, Jumeirah 3 and Umm Suqeim 1, collectively drawing roughly 1.5 million visitors in 18 months, indicating strong public appetite for round-the-clock coastal leisure.In early February 2026, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Dubai Executive Council approved a Dh500 million master plan to transform Umm Suqeim Beach, which currently spans about 3.1 km. The redevelopment seeks to elevate the area into a year-round destination that combines urban beach life with broader tourism appeal, aiming to welcome up to 6 million visitors annually.The comprehensive project includes infrastructure upgrades, expanded parking, smart lighting for night use and integrated transport hubs, all designed to make the beach more accessible, vibrant and enjoyable. Covering nearly 445,000 square metres, the project will expand the usable beach area by around 30%.A strong focus on accessibility and safety underpins the upgrade. Smart lighting will be installed across 130,000 square metres, allowing for safer evening and night-time use. Parking capacity will increase by 200% to approximately 2,400 spaces, alongside improved road access. Connectivity across the site will be enhanced through 10 mobility hubs and 11 dedicated taxi pick-up and drop-off points, while new cycling tracks, electric vehicle facilities and scooter infrastructure will encourage sustainable transport.Dubai’s beach transformation does not stop at the sea. A new artificial “mountain beach” project in Hatta will feature a Crystal Lagoon and waterfront amenities within the mountainous landscape, bringing a unique beach experience far from the Gulf shore. This destination, complete with walking paths, cycling trails, water sports zones, dining spots and even outdoor cinemas, aims to redefine what beach tourism can look like in Dubai’s varied terrain.One of the project’s standout features is a 38-metre observation tower, inspired by Dubai’s maritime heritage. Designed as a visual landmark, the tower will offer panoramic views of the coastline, adding a new experiential highlight to the beach.Technology and sustainability are central to the redevelopment. AI-powered monitoring and operational systems will improve safety and operational efficiency, while engineering measures such as retaining walls and elevated beach levels have been incorporated to address sea-level rise. Sustainable design principles are woven throughout the public spaces, reinforcing Dubai’s long-term vision for resilient and future-ready coastal destinations.Across all projects, Dubai’s beach strategy prioritises accessibility, inclusivity and smart technology:Many of these enhancements align with Dubai’s long-term plans to elevate quality of life, boost tourism and create coastal public spaces that rival global beach destinations. The coming years will see Dubai’s beaches evolve from simple seaside escape routes into multi-faceted public destinations that blend lifestyle, technology, inclusivity and sustainability.Whether it is the expanded Jumeirah Beach 1, the connected Al Mamzar Corniche with its floating bridge, the mammoth Umm Suqeim makeover or the innovative mountain-lagoon scene in Hatta, Dubai is redefining what a beach experience can look like in the 21st century. With more space, new services and night-long leisure options, the emirate’s coastline is poised to become an even greater magnet for residents, tourists and global visitors, a continuous celebration of sun, sea and urban life.","Dubai’s iconic coastline is undergoing one of its most ambitious transformations in years.

How the service works





Why it matters









The UAE has rolled out a new public-facing security reporting service, giving residents a direct and confidential way to alert authorities to potential threats, as the State Security Department strengthens its preventive security framework.The UAE State Security Department has launched the “SSD” service, a dedicated channel that allows members of the public to report security-related concerns that could affect public safety and social stability. The initiative is designed to support faster responses, improve the efficiency of preventive security operations, and reinforce the national security system.Authorities say the service is rooted in the belief that security is a shared responsibility. Public awareness and participation are viewed as the first line of defence against potential threats. By opening a direct line of communication, the department aims to encourage individuals to take an active role in protecting national achievements and maintaining a safe and stable society.The SSD service receives reports covering a wide range of security issues. These include extremist activity, suspicious behaviour, threats to community security and individual safety, insults to the state and its symbols, information leaks, espionage, and other actions or observations that may impact social stability.Reports can be submitted through a toll-free number, 800 6600, which provides a fast and direct way for the public to share security-related information. The department has emphasised that all reports are handled with strict confidentiality. The identity of the reporter is not disclosed, and the highest standards of privacy and data protection are applied, allowing individuals to share information freely and without concern.Officials say the service is intended to strengthen community partnership and build trust between the public and security institutions. By enabling early reporting, authorities aim to prevent risks before they escalate and to preserve social peace.The launch of the SSD service also coincides with the verification of the State Security Department’s official account on the X platform. The account is positioned as an interactive channel to raise security awareness, share accurate information and alerts, and encourage constructive engagement with the public in support of national security and stability.","The UAE State Security Department has launched the ‘SSD’ service, a dedicated channel that allows members of the public to report security-related concerns.

Lucy Letby Netflix documentary: Why UK baby-killer nurse’s parents call it ‘invasion of privacy’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/lucy-letby-netflix-documentary-why-uk-baby-killer-nurses-parents-call-it-invasion-of-privacy-explained/articleshow/127847789.cms,"‘We will not watch it’: Parents condemn documentary

Use of family home footage sparks privacy concerns

Questions Raised Over Police Cooperation

Who Is Lucy Letby?





A new Netflix documentary on convicted British neonatal nurse Lucy Letby has sparked fresh controversy in the UK, with her parents accusing the streaming giant of a “complete invasion of privacy” for allegedly using footage of their family home without consent.The Investigation of Lucy Letby, set to stream from February 4 on Netflix, promises viewers “unseen footage and unheard insider accounts” from one of Britain’s most disturbing criminal cases.However, even before its release, the series has drawn criticism from Letby’s family, reopening debates around ethics, victimhood and privacy in true-crime storytelling.Lucy Letby’s parents, Susan and John Letby, have said they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.In a statement to The Guardian, the couple said previous media coverage, including televised images of their daughter being led away in handcuffs, had already been “heartbreaking,” but claimed the Netflix production crossed a new line.“This documentary is on another level,” they said. “We will not watch it. It would likely kill us if we did.”A major point of contention for the Letbys is the alleged inclusion of footage filmed inside or around their long-time family home, without their knowledge.The couple said they were unaware that the documentary would feature images of the house where they have lived for more than 40 years, located in a small town where, they say, “everyone knows everyone.”They also criticised a clip shown in the documentary’s trailer, which reportedly depicts Lucy Letby being arrested in her bedroom and saying goodbye to one of her cats.“All this taking place in the home where we have lived for decades,” they said, calling it “a complete invasion of privacy.”The parents further questioned why an investigating officer involved in the case was permitted to discuss or show what occurred inside their home on the day of Letby’s arrest.“We always cooperated fully,” they said, asking why Netflix and the production company did not inform them before using such material.Netflix and ITN Productions, which produced the documentary, have not publicly responded to these claims.Lucy Letby, born 4 January 1990, is a former neonatal nurse who worked at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England. She came under suspicion after an unusually high number of infant deaths occurred in the neonatal unit between June 2015 and June 2016.After a lengthy investigation, Letby was charged in November 2020 with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder involving newborn babies.In August 2023, she was convicted of seven counts of murder and seven counts of attempted murder.She received a whole-life prison sentence, meaning she will never be eligible for release. In July 2024, she was also found guilty in a retrial of an attempted murder charge on which the jury had previously failed to reach a verdict.Letby is currently incarcerated at HMP Low Newton in Durham.","Lucy Letby’s parents say they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.

UK households urged to stockpile three essentials ahead of Storm Chandra power cut risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-households-urged-to-stockpile-three-essentials-ahead-of-storm-chandra-power-cut-risk/articleshow/127574703.cms,"UK households are urged to prepare torches, spare batteries and phone chargers ahead of potential power cuts/ Image: Pexels

“

Storm Chandra

will bring persistent rain, heavy at times, later Monday and overnight before steadily clearing northeastwards on Tuesday morning. 30–50mm rainfall is likely widely, with 60–80mm across some higher ground, especially south Dartmoor. Falling on saturated ground, this is likely to lead to flooding and disruption, particularly on Tuesday morning. Strong southeasterly winds are also expected.”

“Whilst accumulating snow is unlikely at low-levels, there will be a sharp increase in snow depths with elevation, with the potential for 2–5cm in places above about 300m, 5–10cm above 400m, and 10–20cm above 500m. This may impact some high-level routes, with drifting possible in rather brisk southeasterly winds. Strong, gusty winds, especially to the west of hills, may exacerbate the potential for transport disruption.”

“Storm Chandra will bring a range of hazards to the UK through Monday night and Tuesday. Initially strong winds will impact the Isles of Scilly, western Cornwall and southwest Wales which are still vulnerable after Storm Goretti, gusts of 70 to 80mph are possible here. Heavy rain is an additional hazard as it falls on saturated ground in Dorset and southern parts of Devon, Somerset and Cornwall.

As Chandra interacts with colder air further north snow becomes a hazard, with 10–20cm of snow possibly accumulating over higher ground in the Pennines, southern Scotland and the Highlands. With a complex spell of weather, it’s important people stay up to date with the forecast and any warnings in your area.”

The three items households are urged to have ready

First, a torch. British Gas recommends a battery-powered or wind-up (kinetic) torch to ensure light is available if electricity supplies are interrupted.

Second, spare batteries. Households are advised to stock up on appropriate batteries. such as AA or AAA, for torches and other essential devices.

Third, a backup charger for mobile phones. A portable battery pack with a charging cable can help people stay connected and access updates during an outage.

“You might even consider a battery-powered radio, to keep on top of local updates if you can’t use your mobile.”





The Met Office has issued a series of weather warnings covering snow, rain and wind from late Monday through Tuesday. These include a 17-hour yellow warning for rain and snow from midnight Tuesday until 5pm, an amber warning for wind in eastern Northern Ireland, and an amber warning for rain across parts of south-west England.Explaining the risk in the south of England, the Met Office said:In northern England and Scotland, snow rather than rain is the main concern. The Met Office warned:In a broader briefing on the storm, the Met Office said Storm Chandra will bring “a further spell of wet and windy conditions later Monday and into Tuesday”, with gusty winds initially affecting the Isles of Scilly, western Cornwall and south-west Wales before moving north through the Irish Sea.An amber warning for wind has been issued for eastern Northern Ireland, where gusts of 60–70mph are expected widely, with up to 75mph possible in coastal areas. Heavy rain falling on already saturated ground in south Devon, Dorset, southern Somerset and south-east Cornwall could lead to flooding, while colder air further north will turn precipitation into hill snow across northern England and Scotland.Met Office Chief Forecaster Paul Gundersen said:With the risk of power cuts rising during periods of severe weather, energy firm British Gas has urged households to make sure they have three key items readily available.British Gas added:While additional supplies such as non-perishable food and blankets can be useful, the focus of the advice is on lighting, communication and access to information during potential power disruptions as Storm Chandra moves across the UK.","UK households urged to prepare torches, spare batteries and phone chargers ahead of potential power cuts.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets. The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Benefit-focused main character energy, zero effort

All the things your phone quietly gets done

Built to keep up with your grind

A phone that looks as good as it performs

Disclaimer: The article has been produced on behalf of Samsung by the Times Internet's Spotlight team.

In a world where your feed is your first impression, every scroll, every story, every share counts. For Gen Z, a phone isn't just a device, it's your creative studio, your personal brand HQ, and your ticket to standing out in an ocean of content. But creating content that cuts through the noise takes a device that keeps up with you. Scroll, shoot, share, repeat. If that sounds familiar, you're not alone. Gen Z lives where content is currency and your feed is your calling card. Standing out shouldn't mean stressing out, it should feel natural, like your phone just gets you.Creating content that stops the scroll is harder than it looks. The lighting's never right, the blur's not blurry enough, and somehow your phone dies right when inspiration hits. Sound familiar? What if your phone could fix all that without you even thinking about it?Let's talk about what really sets the Galaxy F70e 5G apart. That showstopper camera. At its core is a 50MP ultra-clear camera that captures every detail, whether you're shooting in bright daylight or moody café lighting. But the real magic happens when you switch to portrait mode. The dedicated 2MP Depth Camera works alongside the main shooter to nail that professional-grade bokeh effect, you know, the one where your subject is razor-sharp and the background melts into a dreamy blur. It's the difference between a photo and a moment. Whether you're capturing your best angle for a selfie (hello, 8MP front camera) or shooting your friends mid-laugh, every frame comes out looking like it deserves its own gallery.Here's where it gets good. Ever notice how influencers' portraits always look cinematic? That's not luck, it's depth. The Galaxy F70e 5G's camera setup is built specifically to give you that main-character energy in every shot. Shooting your OOTD against a busy street? The depth camera isolates you perfectly, turning chaos into aesthetic.Candid café pics? The bokeh makes even basic backgrounds look intentional. You don't need to be a pro photographer or spend hours editing, the phone does the heavy lifting. Just point, shoot, and watch your content go from ‘nice’ to ‘wait, how did you take that?’ It's not about faking it; it's about making your real moments look as good as they feel.Everything you do on this phone: scrolling, streaming, gaming, browsing, deserves to look good and feel smooth. That's where the 6.7-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate comes in. But a great display means nothing if your battery can't keep up. The difference is immediate: animations are fluid, transitions are seamless, and even just swiping through your apps feels satisfying. Whether you're watching the latest series drop or just casually doom-scrolling at 2 AM, the experience stays premium. It's the kind of upgrade you feel every single time you pick up your phone. Because your screen time should feel as good as it looks.Your phone is with you from the moment you wake up to those late-night scrolling sessions. That's why the new Galaxy F70e 5G packs a massive 6000mAh battery , optimised by One UI 8 to actually last. We're talking up to 26 hours of video playback, the kind of endurance that takes you from morning commute binges to late-night streaming without breaking a sweat. So whether you're streaming shows on your commute, gaming between classes, video calling friends, or yes, shooting that perfect reel, you're covered. No more rationing your screen time or hunting for chargers mid-day. And when you do need juice, 25W fast charging gets you back up to speed without the wait.Let's talk about the look. The Galaxy F70e 5G comes in two head-turning shades: Limelight Green and Spotlight Blue, because your phone should reflect your vibe. Both colours are designed to stand out, whether you're pulling it out at a café or setting it down for a flat lay. At just 199g and 8.2mm slim, it's comfortable to hold and easy to carry all day. Plus, with IP54 water and dust resistance, it’s built for everyday life: light splashes, dusty pockets, and everything in between. And if you need more space for all those photos and videos? The 128GB internal storage is expandable up to 2TB via microSD card.Under the hood, the Galaxy F70e 5G is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6300 processor with up to 6GB RAM, paired with a 120Hz display for a lag-free experience whether you're multitasking, gaming, or scrolling through your feed. With support for multiple 5G bands and dual SIM flexibility, you're future-proofed for connectivity wherever you go. It runs on Android 16 with One UI 8.0, giving you the latest features and a clean, intuitive interface. Side-mounted fingerprint sensor for quick unlocking, dual 5G SIM support for flexibility, and a 3.5mm headphone jack for those who like their audio wired. The model is packed with thoughtful details that just make sense for how you actually use your phone.The Galaxy F70e 5G isn't just another smartphone, it's your creative partner, your entertainment hub, and your everyday companion rolled into one sleek package.

Priced at a special launch offer of ₹11,999, the device makes premium features accessible without the flagship price tag.

How early AI education in schools can help India build a future ready generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-early-ai-education-in-schools-can-help-india-build-a-future-ready-generation/articleshow/128183780.cms,"Why India needs early AI literacy now



The core skills early AI education builds



Making AI education truly inclusive



Empowering teachers for the AI era



The time to act is now



By: Muneer Ahmad Khant, Managing Director at ViewSonic India

India is home to over 600 million people under the age of 25 making it the world’s largest youth population. That sheer number, combined with our status as the fastest-growing major economy, puts the country right at the heart of the global AI revolution. We already produce some of the best tech talent in the world, but foundational AI understanding is still missing in most schools, especially beyond the big cities.Bringing AI into classrooms early isn’t just a good idea but also essential if we want to turn this huge youth energy into something lasting. Starting young builds curiosity, sharpens critical thinking, and plants a strong sense of ethics, so children grow up ready not only to use intelligent tools but to create with them responsibly.National initiatives like Digital India and Atmanirbhar Bharat are pushing AI into every corner of life. Studies suggest it could add as much as $500 billion to our GDP by 2030, while creating millions of new jobs and changing many more. From precision farming that supports millions of agricultural workers to diagnostic tools addressing the critical doctor-patient ratio, AI is already transforming healthcare, agriculture, finance, and manufacturing.Yet real obstacles such as years of rote learning habits, the deep urban-rural digital gap, and a projected shortage of 1.4 million AI professionals by 2026 continue to persist. Early exposure can ease worries about technology, spark ideas that matter locally, and help our children become builders of AI rather than just users. Many forward-looking classrooms, equipped with interactive and visual tools, are already showing that this change can reach every part of the country.Early AI education goes beyond coding. It's about making technology feel approachable through simple, fun activities such as questioning what an AI suggests to sharpen thinking. Children learn to recognize the patterns to build data sense, or using AI to make art and unlock imagination. Along the way, they naturally pick up logical reasoning, teamwork, and ease working alongside smart systems.Ethics matter just as much, and plans are in place to start teaching bias, privacy, and responsible use from Grade 3, as upcoming Ministry of Education guidelines suggest. In a country as diverse as ours, this kind of awareness creates thoughtful digital citizens. Interactive displays and visual platforms turn tricky concepts into something children can touch and explore, letting them draw, experiment, and work together instantly. The result? Learning that feels joyful and memorable.India’s rich linguistic diversity, rural-urban divide, and varied learning abilities create distinct challenges in education. The good news is that AI itself helps clear them. Multilingual resources now cover more than 22 languages through platforms like the Skill India Digital Hub, opening doors for every child. Adaptive tools match each student’s pace, and pilots have shown engagement rising by up to 68%. Visual and interactive technologies go further, carrying quality education even to rural vocational centres.When these are part of connected classroom setups, they deliver truly personalised lessons, voice recognition, and support in regional languages so that no one is left out. Teachers get instant insights into each child’s needs, turning our diversity from a barrier into real strength.As AI steps into classrooms, teachers move from giving lectures to guiding curiosity and ethical conversations. Helpful tools take over routine planning, create content that fits local contexts, and give quick feedback, so educators can focus on real mentoring.Initiatives like NISHTHA and the new AI Centre of Excellence, supported by ₹500 crore in the 2025-26 Budget, are preparing millions of teachers nationwide. In our 1.5 million schools, digital classrooms with interactive panels, wireless sharing, and cloud software are making widespread change possible, even where resources are tight. The SOAR programme, with its focused modules for grades 6–12, shows how national initiatives can bring structured AI literacy to huge numbers of students.The broader impact on India’s futureChildren who grow up comfortable with machine intelligence, data-driven choices, and human-AI teamwork will thrive in jobs we can barely imagine today. They’ll push forward on the issues that matter most such as smarter cities, climate solutions, better healthcare access, and sustainable farming, while standing strong on the world stage. Finland and Singapore have already seen the rewards of starting AI literacy early; with our unmatched scale, India can move ahead even quicker.Early AI education is the foundation for a bolder, more confident, and fairer India. By carefully bringing intelligent, visual, and connected classroom solutions into schools from Grade 3 onwards, policymakers, teachers, and technology partners can together release the full power of our youth.In today’s classrooms, where visual collaboration tools and interactive ecosystems make learning lively and inclusive, children begin to see AI not as something far away and mysterious, but as a partner they can steer. When that shift happens, young Indians won’t just face the future but also build it.","India is home to over 600 million people under the age of 25 making it the world’s largest youth population.
