Kylie Kelce , wife of former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce , has been making waves with her popular podcast Not Gonna Lie with Kylie Kelce, where she openly shares her experiences as a mother. With three daughters—Wyatt, Ellie, and Bennett—already part of the Kelce household and a fourth child on the way, Kylie has implemented a strict rule when it comes to technology: her children are not allowed to use or own phones.In the latest episode of her podcast, Kylie Kelce explained how she ensures her children grow up with a balanced approach to technology. While she does allow them to watch shows on tablets, smartphones are completely off-limits.“They are not allowed to touch phones,” Kylie stated. “That has been a rule from the very beginning. Occasionally, they will borrow someone’s phone and take pictures. Wyatt is really into taking selfies right now. Dad’s really thrilled about that one.”The Kelce household operates with a structured approach to screen time. Kylie admitted that while her daughters do watch content on tablets, she cleverly manages their usage. “I will pretend that I set a timer and I will tell them, ‘One more,’” she shared. “If my task that I was trying to complete is not finished, I will say, ‘You guys were so well behaved, I’ll let you watch one more.’”This strategy allows her to control their exposure while ensuring they remain engaged in other aspects of childhood beyond screens.Kylie has never shied away from discussing the real challenges of motherhood. On the January 23rd episode of her podcast, she described raising children as the “most selfless” and “all-encompassing” thing a person can do.""At any point in the day, you do have to always be concerned about the tiny humans you're responsible for, but I think there is a misconception that it wipes out the rest of you and makes you solely mom,"" Kylie explained.She further emphasized the importance of maintaining individuality while embracing motherhood. ""Whereas what we need to do is tack it on to the end of the resume and keep the rest of the s--- that also defines us as who we are as people because we're still us,"" she continued. ""Just because we made a human being or we are a mother to a tiny human doesn't mean that we are only mom.""Kylie Kelce’s Not Gonna Lie podcast has rapidly grown in popularity, reaching No. 1 on some platforms and amassing over 290,000 YouTube subscribers. Many of her episodes garner six-digit viewership, solidifying her presence in media.Meanwhile, Jason Kelce has also built a successful career post-football, co-hosting the New Heights podcast with his brother, Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce , as well as contributing to ESPN and other NFL coverage.Also Read: Caitlin Clark confidently names her all-time favorite NFL player – No second thoughts needed With their fourth child on the way, the Kelce household is about to get even busier.

A lit candle accompanied the plate, symbolizing their celebration. ""Better late than never,"" Hudson captioned the post, hinting that their busy schedules may have delayed the special moment.In the background of the photo, the legendary former New England Patriots head coach, 72, could be spotted wearing a dark suit, light blue shirt, and red tie, enjoying a similar dessert in front of him. Despite his reputation for maintaining a low public profile, Belichick has been appearing at more events alongside Hudson, showcasing their growing relationship.Belichick and Hudson’s romance has been in the public eye since June 2024, though their connection dates back to February 2021, when they first met while Hudson was still a college student.

Their first official public appearance as a couple came in December when they attended a gala for the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.In a Valentine's Day post, Hudson took to Instagram to reflect on love and its perceptions, writing, “Love is not to be judged” and emphasizing that no one should be harassed or criticized for their choice in a partner.

In December, he signed a five-year deal to become the head football coach at the University of North Carolina, marking the next chapter in his storied career.

Nasa has postponed the launch of two major space missions, SPHEREx and PUNCH, which were set to lift off aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Saturday night from California.“The additional time will allow teams to continue rocket checkouts ahead of liftoff,” according to an update shared by Nasa. “A new launch date will be announced once confirmed on the range,” it said.SPHEREx will scan the entire sky in infrared light, uncovering secrets about galaxies and cosmic history, while PUNCH will study the sun's outer atmosphere and solar wind.SPHEREx, short for Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer, is a space telescope that will survey the entire sky in 102 colours of infrared light. It will capture about 600 images per day, studying millions of stars and galaxies. Scientists will use the data to track how galaxies have evolved over time, identify frozen water and other essential elements across the Milky Way, and create a three-dimensional map of galaxies to help researchers understand cosmic inflation after the Big Bang.PUNCH, or Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere, is a set of four suitcase-sized satellites designed to study the sun’s outer atmosphere, known as the corona, and the solar wind. One satellite will take detailed images of the sun’s corona, while the other three will track solar wind and coronal mass ejections—massive solar eruptions that can impact Earth’s power grids and satellites. By analysing polarised light, PUNCH will map the movement of solar particles and help improve space weather predictions.","Nasa has postponed the launch of two major space missions.

Mikey Madison won the best actress prize for Brooklyn tragicomedy “Anora.”“Conclave,” which stars Ralph Fiennes as a cardinal corralling conniving clergy as they elect a new pope, beat “The Brutalist,” “Emilia Pérez,” Bob Dylan biopic “ A Complete Unknown "" to the top prize. ""Conclave” was also named outstanding British film and took trophies for editing and adapted screenplay.Supporting performer prizes went to Kieran Culkin for “A Real Pain” and Zoe Saldaña for “Emilia Pérez,"" which also won the award for best film not in the English language.Saldaña won for her role as a lawyer who helps the title character transition to a woman and out of a life of crime. She called the film “the creative challenge of a lifetime.”Best actress nominee Karla Sofía Gascón, who stars as the titular transgender ex-cartel boss in “Emilia Pérez,” wasn’t at the ceremony. Gascón has withdrawn from promoting the film, which has 13 Oscar nominations, amid controversy over her social media posts disparaging Muslims, George Floyd and diversity at the Oscars.Audiard has condemned those comments, but in his acceptance speech thanked Gascón and her co-stars Saldaña and Selena Gomez.“I am deeply proud of what we have all achieved together,"" he said.From the BAFTAs to the OscarsStars including Cynthia Erivo, Hugh Grant, Ariana Grande, Lupita Nyong’o, Timothée Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan walked the red carpet at London’s Royal Festival Hall for the awards, known as BAFTAs.The prizes will be watched for clues about who will triumph at Hollywood’s Academy Awards on March 2, in an unusually hard-to-call awards season.They also have a distinctly British accent. The ceremony kicked off with its kilt-wearing host, Scottish actor David Tennant, leading the audience in a rousing singalong of The Proclaimers’ anthem “I’m Gonna be (500 Miles).”Culkin's award came for “A Real Pain,” about odd couple cousins on a trip to explore their roots. The film's writer and co-star, Jesse Eisenberg, took the BAFTA for best original screenplay.“I’d like to share this with my wife, who didn’t come because she didn’t think I’d win,” Eisenberg quipped.“Anora,” about an exotic dancer entangled with a Russian oligarch's son, had been a best picture favorite after winning the top prizes last week at the Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards.“The Brutalist” had nine BAFTA nominations, while “Anora,” the sci-fi epic “Dune: Part Two” and musical “Wicked” hade seven each. “A Complete Unknown” and Irish-language hip-hop drama “Kneecap” received six nominations apiece.Brody won over stiff competition from Fiennes and Chalamet, who plays the young Dylan in “A Complete Unknown.” The other male actors nominated were Grant for his creepy role in the horror film “ Heretic,” Colman Domingo in real-life prison drama “ Sing Sing ” and Sebastian Stan for his portrayal of a young Donald Trump in “ The Apprentice.”Stan, who is also Oscar nominated, said it was “incredibly validating” to get recognition for the film, which initially struggled to find an American distributor. It's an origins story that focuses on Trump's relationship with ruthless power broker Roy Cohn, played by Jeremy Strong.“We were told this was going to be a thankless job that was never going to lead to anything,” Stan said, describing the movie as a “fair” depiction of the president.Best-actress nominees were Madison, Gascón, Demi Moore for body-horror film “ The Substance,” Ronan for “The Outrun,” Erivo for “Wicked” and Marianne Jean-Baptiste for the Mike Leigh drama “Hard Truths.” Erivo or Jean-Baptiste would have been the first non-white performer to win the leading actress BAFTA.Animated caper “Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl” won awards for best animated feature and best family and children’s film.Sci-fi epic “Dune: Part Two” won prizes for sound and visual effects. “The Brutalist” won for cinematography and musical score. Musical “Wicked” took the costume and production design trophies.Rising stars and lifetime honorsBritain’s film academy introduced changes to increase the awards’ diversity in 2020, when no women were nominated as best director for the seventh year running and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white.Most winners are chosen by 8,000 members of the U.K. academy of industry professionals, with one — the Rising Star Award —- selected by public vote from a shortlist of nominees. This year's winner was David Jonsson, star of high finance drama series “Industry” and London rom-com “Rye Lane.”“Star, I don’t know,” he said. “But rising, I guess.”“Willow” and “Return of the Jedi” actor Warwick Davis received the academy’s top honor, the BAFTA Fellowship, for his screen career and work to create a more inclusive film industry.He founded a talent agency for actors under 5 feet tall, because, he said, “short actors weren’t known for their talent, just their height.”BAFTA chairwoman Sara Putt sent a message of strength to everyone hit by last month’s devastating Los Angeles wildfires. Jamie Lee Curtis, a supporting actress nominee for “The Last Showgirl,” was absent because the fires delayed filming on her current work.The event was without a dash of royal glamour this year. Neither Prince William, who is honorary president of the British film academy, nor his wife Kate are attending. The awards coincide with school holidays for their three children.William, 42, sent a recorded video message that was played before the presentation of the Rising Star Award.","Papal thriller ""Conclave "" wins four prizes including best picture.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.

Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Chromecast 2nd Gen outage: The error message

Users of Google's second-generation Chromecast and Chromecast Audio devices are experiencing significant issues due to an authentication error, preventing them from casting content from their smartphones or tablets. As reported by 9to5Google, users from around the globe are experiencing issues with the devices.The issue first gained traction on the r/googlehome subreddit, where multiple users shared their experiences of being unable to connect to their Chromecast (2nd Gen). Users have attempted common troubleshooting methods, such as restarting, factory resetting, reinstalling the Google Home app, clearing cache/data, and even trying different networks, but none of these steps appear to resolve the issue.Some users have encountered an error message that reads: “Untrusted device: [name] couldn’t be verified. This could be caused by outdated device firmware.” This message effectively locks users out of casting capabilities, as it only provides an option to close the dialog box.Interestingly, the problem seems to only affect older Chromecast models, specifically the 2nd generation Chromecast and Chromecast Audio. Newer models, like the Chromecast (3rd gen) and Chromecast Ultra, are reportedly functioning without any issues.Many users are concerned that Google may have quietly discontinued support for these older Chromecast models, effectively rendering them unusable overnight. Given Google's history of sunsetting products without much warning, this concern isn’t entirely unwarranted. However, the nature of the error message suggests that this might be more of a software bug than an intentional shutdown.As users await further information, the uncertainty looms over whether a fix will be implemented soon.","Users of Google's second-generation Chromecast and Chromecast Audio devices are experiencing significant issues due to an authentication error.

“They released this and The Night Agent within the same month. What did they expect?”

“I kept confusing this show for The Night Agent anytime I saw news about it, so maybe it was destined to be axed.”

Comparisons to ‘The Night Agent’ and scheduling issues

Show creator’s response and future possibilities

""We'd all be there in a heartbeat,” Hawley wrote. “If not, man, we left it all on the field. For those who haven't yet watched, dive in. I swear to God you'll enjoy the ride. In an age of shows that feel like homework, The Recruit is a blast that has stakes, humor, and hardcore action which will keep you leaning forward.”

Netflix’s response and the ongoing debate

Netflix subscribers were left disappointed after the unexpected cancellation of the spy drama The Recruit. The show, which followed the life of a young CIA lawyer entangled in international conflicts, had gained a dedicated fan base since its premiere in December 2022. However, its fate was sealed after its second season aired in January 2025. The news came as a shock to many, especially considering the positive reception of the latest season. Fans have taken to social media to express frustration, blaming the decision on poor scheduling and comparisons with another Netflix spy thriller, The Night Agent. Amid growing outcry, creator Alexi Hawley has expressed hope for a potential film to conclude the series properly.On March 5, 2025, actor Colton Dunn, who played Lester Kitchens in The Recruit, took to Instagram to break the news of the show's cancellation. Calling it “such a bummer,” Dunn thanked fans for their support and shared fond memories from the set. His announcement sparked an immediate backlash from viewers, who questioned Netflix’s decision.Many fans pointed out that The Recruit had been released too closely to The Night Agent, another espionage drama that had already gained significant popularity. Social media platforms were flooded with complaints, with users accusing Netflix of sabotaging The Recruit by scheduling it within weeks of The Night Agent's second season premiere.One frustrated viewer wrote on X (formerly Twitter),Another echoed similar sentiments, saying,While both The Recruit and The Night Agent belong to the same genre, The Night Agent had already established itself as a fan favorite with strong viewership numbers. Netflix renewed The Night Agent for a second season following its success, but The Recruit struggled to achieve the same traction.Industry analysts speculate that Netflix’s decision to release both spy thrillers within a short timeframe may have led to audience confusion. With The Night Agent already commanding attention, The Recruit struggled to carve out its own identity.Unlike The Night Agent, which continued to perform well, The Recruit reportedly underperformed in terms of viewership, making it a likely target for cancellation. However, fans argue that given more time, the show could have developed a stronger following.Following the backlash, The Recruit creator Alexi Hawley addressed fans in what he called a “love letter” to the series. He acknowledged the disappointment surrounding the cancellation but hinted at the possibility of a film to properly conclude the story.Despite the cancellation, Hawley’s comments have given fans a glimmer of hope for a potential follow-up, though no official plans have been announced.As of now, Netflix has not provided an official statement regarding the cancellation of The Recruit. However, the streaming giant’s content strategy has come under scrutiny, with users frequently complaining about the abrupt termination of shows without a proper conclusion.The debate over Netflix’s handling of its original series continues to grow, as fans argue that promising shows are often cut short due to business decisions rather than creative merit. Meanwhile, The Night Agent remains a dominant force in the spy-thriller genre, further fueling frustrations over the fate of The Recruit.","The Recruit was canceled by Netflix after its second season aired in January 2025.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat. In the post, Altman wrote “very proud of the openai team for what is perhaps the most impressive scientific/technical breakthrough of recent decades…thought that was the thing i'd always be most proud of in life”. Adding further, he wrote “turns out i am now more proud of a preemie baby for learning how to eat on his own!”.In a follow-up post, Altman wrote “i realize i am getting neurochemically hacked here but idc, it's the best)”.Sam Altman welcomed his baby boy last month with his partner and software engineer Oliver Mulherin. The baby arrived prematurely and has been receiving care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).In another news, the CEO shared an update about the company’s latest version of the large language model (LLM), GPT-4.5 . In an X post, Altman announced that GPT-4.5 is expected to roll out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers. However, he noted that the update will be a staggered rollout over several days to manage high demand and ensure a smooth user experience.Altman also explained that launching with a low rate limit would restrict usage and prevent users from having meaningful interactions with the new model. The staggered release will allow users to have longer conversations with GPT-4.5, even if it means some subscribers will have to wait a bit longer to access it.In his X announcement, Altman wrote: “We are likely going to roll out GPT-4.5 to the plus tier over a few days. There is no perfect way to do this; we wanted to do it for everyone tomorrow, but it would have meant we had to launch with a very low rate limit. We think people are gonna use this a lot and love it.”","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat.

Ava Raine’s Journey: From Wrestling Newcomer to WWE Decision-Maker

Is Ava Raine going to be a main-roster star in the future?

Despite belonging to the Samoan wrestling lineage, the fourth-generation star and the daughter of the WWE megastar Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Ava Raine , has carved a different journey for herself. From making a WWE debut to being a part of the company’s management, the 23-year-old has made astonishing developments at a young age. Currently serving as the general manager for NXT , this article explores the possibilities of the young star’s WWE future.With a passion and interest for wrestling, Raine first expressed her interest in entering the world of wrestling in 2017, following in her father's footsteps. Hailing from prominent wrestling royalty, Raine began her wrestling training at the WWE Performance Center at the tender age of 18. She made her first in-ring debut under the WWE’s developmental brand NXT in 2022. Amid enrolling in pro wrestling, Simone Johnson invented Ava Raine. She made her on-screen debut as the fourth member behind the mask of the faction The Schism’s stable alongside Joe Gacy, The Dyad’s Rip Fowler, and Jagger Reid.Raine had a brief wrestling journey with only six total matches wrestled, out of which three never made it to the viewers. Her last in-ring appearance was her bout against Nile at the NXT: Heatwave special. After a short live wrestling journey due to the slow decline of Joe Gacy’s Schism’s Stable faction, Raine’s transition to a managerial position was more of a déjà vu moment. When the former NXT GM William Regal returned on-screen to offer the young star a promotion, people were quick to recall the similarity of the event with The Rock ’s addition to the TKO board of directors.As the daughter of one of the biggest WWE megastars, a main-roster debut is not that difficult to attain for the rising star; however, her work as the GM in NXT cannot be overlooked. As Raine continues to perform exceptionally at her newfound passion for managerial positions, she has been part of historic announcements of the brand, including the addition of the NXT North American Championship. Moreover, Raine is also the youngest general manager in the history of WWE and was praised by the Chief Content Officer of WWE, Triple H , for being one of the most efficient hard workers.While many fans might hold on to the possibility of seeing The Rock’s daughter inside the squared circle, the chances remain pretty bleak. Considering the consistent hard work and determination Raine invests in her managerial position; her in-ring debut is way farther than we expect. However, fans can always catch a glimpse of the young star on-screen amid her managing the roster talents. She might be the daughter of one of the biggest stars in the world of pro wrestling, but her independent pursuit of her career is truly inspiring.Also Read: ""Just a Bottom For The Rock""- Randy Orton criticizes John Cena for Heel turn on WWE SmackDown","Ava Raine is the daughter of WWE megastar Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.
