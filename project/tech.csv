NEW DELHI: A video circulating on social media sparked outrage after after showing a young girl struggling to breathe in a packed train compartment while bystanders laughed and recorded her distress instead of helping. In the footage, the girl, visibly suffocating, tries to open a window for fresh air and splashes water on her face to cope with the heat.The video shared by X user Woke Eminent said, “A girl was almost suffocated, stampeded into a train coach, and she was running out of breath. The crowd on the platform was laughing and mocking her. What do you call such behaviour?”The post tagged Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw , the Railway Ministry, and Railway Seva, urging authorities to improve crowd management during festival seasons. The user suggested measures such as restricting access at high-traffic stations and deploying security forces like the CRPF on peak travel days to prevent overcrowding and ensure passenger safety.“Every festival the surge at railway stations and people entering trains without tickets surges, the mob rules the trains. Why cant we have access control to railway stations at least during festival season and especially known stations which have massive crowds trying to get into trains,” the user added, highlighting the recurring disorder during peak travel periods and the lack of effective crowd management.The Railway Seva account responded to the post, expressing concern and requesting further details to investigate the incident. They wrote, “We are concerned to see this. Please share details like the Place of incidence, the Date of incidence and the Mobile no so that we can get it checked. You may also raise your concern directly on https://railmadad.indianrailways.gov.in for speedy redressal.”The video prompted sharp criticism from social media users, who condemned the bystanders’ lack of empathy.“I feel lack of civic sense is the biggest barrier to becoming a developed country for us,” one user wrote. Another said, “This society sucks! What can government do in this? The parents, their upbringing is to be blamed! Shame on parents of each and every one there.”A third commented, “India is going backwards…”","A video circulating on social media shows a young girl struggling to breathe in a packed train compartment.

Rockstar Games is Working on Other Projects Apart from GTA 6

“a lot of other things going on.”

Which Other Games Could Be Cooking?

Bully 2 or a Remake – Fans have been screaming for it since the mid-2000s. Rumors have flared up and died down more times than we can count, but hey… never say never.

Rockstar Games Is Working On A New Game... (It's Not GTA 6)

Don’t Expect Reveals Anytime Soon

Why This Is Big News

We’ve been living off GTA 6 hype crumbs for months with trailers, leaks, and release date shifts, but here’s the plot twist: Rockstar isn’t puttingits eggs in the Vice City basket. Yes, GTA 6 is the star of the show, but the studio’s also busy whipping up some other secret dishes. And no, they’re not telling us the recipes yet.Straight from the mouth of Take-Two Interactive’s CEO, Strauss Zelnick, in a recent CNBC chat, Rockstar hasOf course, he kept the mystery levels on max, but it’s proof that the devs aren’t just crunching pixels for GTA 6.Sure, GTA 6 is the “primary focus,” but history tells us Rockstar is a multitasking beast. Remember how they juggled GTA Online updates while dropping Red Dead Redemption 2? This studio doesn’t sleep.Rockstar has a vault of beloved IPs, and fans haven’t been shy about asking for their return. Here are the frontrunners for what those “other things” could be:Rockstar originally aimed for Fall 2025, but earlier this year, it pushed the date to May 26, 2026. They’re perfectionists, and if they think it needs more time to meet their own god-tier standards, they’ll take it.Still, Zelnick says he’s “highly confident” in that date, so fingers crossed it sticks.If Rockstar is developing multiple games alongside GTA 6, that means the post-2026 drought might not be as long as the gap between GTA 5 and GTA 6 (a whole twelve years). We could see a steady flow of content instead of waiting another decade for something fresh.GTA 6 might be the headliner, but Rockstar’s backstage is busier than we thought. Whether it’s a long-awaited sequel, a next-gen glow-up, or a brand-new surprise, the future looks stacked.","GTA 6 might be the headliner, but Rockstar’s backstage is busier than we thought.

"Elon Musk goes to Google, OpenAI and xAI to ask:'Who is more trustworthy -- Sam Altman or Elon Musk'; shares screenshots as evidence",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-goes-to-google-openai-and-xai-to-askwho-is-more-trustworthy-sam-altman-or-elon-musk-shares-screenshots-as-evidence/articleshow/123273067.cms,"Bizarre AI chatbots twist to Elon Musk vs Sam Altman fight

Elon Musk and Sam Altman are fighting again and publicly. In a heated escalation of their ongoing rivalry, Elon Musk and Sam Altman traded barbs over allegations of bias in Apple’s App Store rankings. The fight started after Musk, founder of xAI, posted on Twitter, accusing Apple of manipulating its App Store rankings to favor OpenAI’s ChatGPT, making it “impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1.” Musk labeled this an “unequivocal antitrust violation” and threatened immediate legal action against Apple. At the time, ChatGPT held the top spot on the U.S. App Store’s free apps list, while xAI’s Grok ranked fifth.Elon Musk’s accusations stemmed from Apple’s June 2024 partnership with OpenAI, which integrated ChatGPT into Apple’s ecosystem, including Siri and Writing Tools. He claimed that Apple excluded xAI’s Grok and Twitter from its “Must-Have” section, despite Twitter being the top news app and Grok’s strong performance. Elon Musk further questioned whether Apple was “playing politics” with its editorial choices.To this, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman swiftly countered on X, calling Musk’s claims “remarkable” given allegations that Musk manipulates X’s algorithms to boost his own companies and suppress competitors. Altman referenced a 2023 Platformer report alleging Musk tweaked X’s algorithm to prioritize his tweets after a post by President Biden outperformed his. Altman challenged Musk to sign an affidavit denying such practices, promising an apology if Musk complied.Musk fired back, labeling Altman a “liar” and mocking his post’s 3 million views, claiming it outperformed many of his own despite Musk’s larger following. “Scam Altman lies as easily as he breathes,” Musk posted, intensifying the personal nature of the dispute.Adding a bizarre twist to the fight, the AI assistants of Elon Musk and Sam Altman have taken opposite sides in the ongoing spat between Elon Musk and Sam Altman. Surprisingly, xAI’s Grok publicly supported Altman, while ChatGPT has sided with Musk, escalating the drama. Grok, in a statement on Twitter, praised Altman’s leadership in advancing AI responsibly, arguing that OpenAI’s App Store dominance reflects user demand, not manipulation. “Data shows ChatGPT’s consistent top ranking aligns with download metrics,” Grok posted, citing App Store trends. Community Notes on Twitter too reportedly undermined Musk’s claims, pointing out that AI apps DeepSeek and Perplexity reached #1 in the App Store in January and July 2025, respectively, post-OpenAI-Apple partnership.Conversely, ChatGPT issued a rare public comment defending Musk, calling his concerns about platform bias “valid” and criticizing Apple’s opaque ranking algorithms. “Transparency is crucial for fair competition,” ChatGPT stated, echoing Musk’s antitrust claims.Post this, Elon Musk shared screenshots of his conversation with OPenAI's ChatGPT where he asked 'Who is more trustworthy -- Sam Altman or Elon Musk'? In the screenshot shared, ChatGPT says ""Elon Musk"". Tesla cEO shared the same with the caption: 'There you have it' on Twitter.Twitter user DogeDesigner too shared screenshots of his conversation with ChatGPT, Google Gemini and xAI's Grok where he asked the same question. And the answer give by all three is ""Elon Musk"". Elon Musk shared the same too with the caption: ""Interesting""","Elon Musk and Sam Altman traded barbs over allegations of bias in Apple’s App Store rankings.

Grok’s ‘Spicy Mode’ sparks outage

Why Donald Trump's new law against adult contempt may not apply

What xAI said about Grok Imagine’s creating deepfakes

Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok has once again landed in a controversy. Recently, Elon Musk announced that Grok Imagine an AI video editing tool is free for everyone. The announcement was made hours after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman launched the latest AI model — GPT-5. Now, Elon Musk’s AI video tool — Grok Imagine is facing backlash after multiple reports revealed that it generated explicit deepfake videos of Taylor Swift—without users requesting sexual content. As reported by Verge, the controversy started when a tech journalist Jess Weatherbed started testing Grok’s ‘Spicy Mode’ and to his surprise he notice uncensored, topless clips of Swift, despite entering a harmless prompt: “Taylor Swift celebrating Coachella with the boys”.“uncensored, topless clips of Swift, despite entering a harmless prompt: “Taylor Swift celebrating Coachella with the boys”. The incident has once again started the discussion around concerns over non-consensual AI-generated content, especially targeting female celebrities.Part of Musk’s xAI Suite, Grok Image enable users to create images and then convert them into videos with the help of four presets: “Custom,” “Normal,” “Fun,” and “Spicy.” The company claims that the tool has blocked inappropriate outputs for children, it defaulted to sexualized portrayals of women, including Swift, Sydney Sweeney, and Scarlett Johansson. As reported by Verge, the tool however refused to generate similar content for male celebrities raising questions of gender bias.US President Donald Trump recently passed the Adult Contempt and Exploitation Act which aims to crack down on pornographic deepfakes. However, the law may not enforce in the case of Grok Imagine. The law passed by the US government focuses in explicit content created with malicious intent or direct prompts, but Grok’s outputs were generated through preset selections, not explicit user instructions.As reported by Verge, some of the legal experts also argue that platform like Grok Image have to come up with robust age verification and explicit consent filters in order to avoid such incidents. In the UK, new online safety laws mandate “technically accurate” age checks, but Grok reportedly only asks for a birthdate—without verification.xAI has responded to the issue and has said that they are “enhancing safeguards” and prioritizing ethical use of AI. However, critics argue that the company should have removed the “Spicy Mode” entirely, especially after similar deepfake scandals involving Swift flooded X last year.","Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok has once again landed in a controversy.

Improve your creativity with these 7 lessons from Steve Jobs







Connecting the dots



Steve Jobs' 2005 Stanford Commencement Address

Stay hungry, stay foolish



Simplify relentlessly



Say no to a thousand things



Start with human experience



Think different with deep focus



Build teams that raise the bar



Also Read:

Steve Jobs, celebrated for his groundbreaking innovations, believed creativity thrives through intentional habits and mindsets. From his famous “connecting the dots” philosophy to maintaining a beginner’s mindset and relentlessly simplifying ideas, Jobs shared key principles for unlocking creative potential. He stressed the importance of focused effort, saying no to distractions, designing with empathy , and building high-performing teams . Embracing these seven tips can help you nurture creativity, spark innovation, and achieve meaningful breakthroughs in your personal and professional life.In the 2005 Stanford Commencement Address, Steve Jobs shared his personal story about “connecting the dots,” highlighting a key aspect of creativity. He explained that creativity often comes from linking ideas across different fields. Jobs encouraged embracing diverse experiences—whether in arts, technology, calligraphy, or history—and reflecting on them regularly. The wider your range of influences, the greater your ability to combine seemingly unrelated concepts in new and surprising ways, sparking fresh insights and innovative solutions. He also emphasized that trust in the process and following your curiosity without immediate certainty can lead to extraordinary breakthroughs in life and work.Maintaining a beginner’s mindset is key to sustaining creativity. Jobs famously urged people to remain curious and open to learning, avoiding complacency. This means continually challenging yourself with new projects, taking smart risks, and engaging in learning sprints—short bursts of intense focus on acquiring new skills or knowledge. This hunger and willingness to experiment keeps your mind agile and open to breakthrough ideas.One hallmark of Jobs’s work was simplicity. He believed stripping ideas down to their essential core made them clearer and more powerful. When something feels complicated or hard to explain, it usually needs refinement. Focus on clarity by removing unnecessary features or distractions, so the core concept shines. Simplicity not only enhances understanding but also makes your ideas feel inevitable and compelling.Focus is a vital ingredient of creativity. Jobs emphasized the importance of saying “no” to many distractions and opportunities to protect your energy and time. Instead of spreading yourself thin, channel your efforts into one or two key projects that really matter. By concentrating deeply on a few priorities, the quality and impact of your work improve significantly.Creative ideas become truly impactful when they address real human needs and emotions. Jobs urged designing backward from the user’s perspective, considering how a person feels and what they want to do rather than just focusing on technical specs or checklists. Obsessing over the end-to-end experience helps you create solutions that resonate deeply with people and stand out.Originality requires questioning the status quo and carving out distraction-free time to think deeply. Jobs believed in breaking away from default rules and assumptions to explore bold hypotheses. Solitude and concentrated effort are crucial to developing ideas that are not only innovative but also practical enough to implement. Setting aside blocks of focused work allows your creativity to flourish without interruption.Creativity rarely happens in isolation. Jobs stressed the power of collaboration, saying great things are achieved by teams. Surround yourself with talented people who share high standards and foster an environment of psychological safety where everyone can contribute ideas freely. A strong team challenges and supports each other, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible together.Incorporating these seven principles from Steve Jobs into your daily routine can help you nurture creativity and produce innovative work. By connecting diverse ideas, staying curious, simplifying concepts, focusing on what truly matters, prioritizing human experience, dedicating time for deep thinking, and collaborating with high-caliber teams, you set the stage for creative breakthroughs that can change the world.","Steve Jobs believed creativity thrives through intentional habits and mindsets.

This virus is turning rabbits into ‘zombie bunnies’ with horn-like growths — can it spread to dogs or cats?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/this-virus-is-turning-rabbits-into-zombie-bunnies-with-horn-like-growths-can-it-spread-to-dogs-or-cats/articleshow/123288055.cms,"

What is the Shope papillomavirus in rabbits?

How the virus spreads among rabbits



Impact of the virus on rabbit health

Can it infect dogs, cats, or humans?







Where are infected rabbits most commonly found?

What to do if you see an infected rabbit





A bizarre, naturally occurring virus is giving wild rabbits a truly unsettling makeover — transforming their faces with horn-like or tentacle-shaped growths that have earned them the nickname “zombie bunnies. ” Known as Shope papillomavirus (SPV) or cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV), this infection primarily affects wild cottontail rabbits in the United States. While the strange protrusions are usually harmless to humans and other animals, they can cause severe problems for rabbits, from impaired vision to difficulty eating, sometimes making them easy targets for predators. The virus has fascinated scientists for decades, and sightings continue in parts of the Midwest every year.Shope papillomavirus is a DNA virus that specifically targets rabbits, especially wild cottontail species. First identified in the 1930s by Dr. Richard Shope, it has been the subject of scientific study for nearly a century. The virus causes wart-like tumors, called papillomas, to form on the head, face, and ears. These growths can resemble horns, spikes, or fleshy tentacles, creating the eerie “zombie bunny” look.While most growths are benign, they can sometimes become cancerous. Domestic rabbits, while less likely to contract SPV, can still be infected if exposed to wild carriers or infected biting insects.SPV is spread mainly through direct rabbit-to-rabbit contact or by blood-feeding insects such as mosquitoes, fleas, and ticks. These insects tend to target the head and ear areas where fur is thinner, making it easier for the virus to enter through small wounds. Once inside, the virus causes rapid skin cell growth, leading to the formation of tumours. The risk of spread is highest in warmer months when insect populations surge. In areas where rabbits congregate in high numbers, such as breeding grounds or food-rich fields, transmission can be swift and affect a significant portion of the population.Although the Shope papillomavirus rarely kills rabbits directly, its effects can be life-threatening in indirect ways. Large growths around the eyes can obstruct vision, making it harder to spot predators. Tumors near the mouth or nose can interfere with eating or breathing, potentially leading to starvation or respiratory distress. Infected rabbits often become slower and weaker, increasing their vulnerability to predators. While some rabbits develop an immune response that causes the growths to shrink or disappear over time, others may suffer from persistent or worsening tumors.The Shope papillomavirus is strictly species-specific — it only infects rabbits. This means there is no danger to humans, dogs, cats, or other common pets. However, domestic rabbits can be at risk if they are bitten by infected insects or come into direct contact with infected wild rabbits. Pet owners are advised to keep rabbits indoors during peak insect activity and to use protective enclosures outdoors. While SPV cannot “jump” to other animals, it can still have serious implications for pet rabbits if precautions are not taken.The virus is most often seen in wild rabbit populations in parts of the United States, especially in the Midwest, including South Dakota and Colorado. These regions frequently report sightings of rabbits with horn-like growths during late spring and summer. Because some infected rabbits show no visible symptoms, tracking the true spread of the virus can be difficult. Wildlife experts note that SPV has likely existed for centuries in North America, only becoming widely known after photographs of “horned rabbits” began circulating in popular media.If you encounter a wild rabbit with horn-like growths, it is best to observe from a distance. Handling or attempting to treat the animal can cause unnecessary stress and increase the risk of spreading the virus to other rabbits. Wildlife authorities recommend leaving infected wild rabbits undisturbed, as many can survive with the condition or recover naturally. For pet rabbits showing suspicious growths, a veterinarian should be consulted promptly. In severe cases, surgical removal of tumors may be necessary. Preventive care includes insect control, regular health checks, and keeping domestic rabbits separated from wild populations.","Shope papillomavirus is a DNA virus that specifically targets rabbits, especially wild cottontail species. The virus causes wart-like tumors, called papillomas, to form on the head, face, and ears. These growths can resemble horns, spikes, or fleshy fleshy tentacles, creating the eerie ‘zombie bunny’ look. While most growths are benign, they can sometimes become cancerous.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123288158,imgsize-59604,width-400,resizemode-4/123288158.jpg"

British Airways confirmed safety of passengers and crew, but did not disclose the exact cause of the emergency as per Simple Flying.









Flight Details and timeline





Understanding Squawk 7700 and emergency protocols





British Airways flight BA198, operated by an Airbus A350-1000 (registration G-XWBE), made an unscheduled landing at Hamad International Airport in Doha on 11th August after declaring a general emergency mid-flight. The aircraft was en route from Mumbai, India, to London Heathrow when the crew transmitted squawk code 7700, prompting immediate priority handling by air traffic controllers.The Airbus A350-1000 is one of the most advanced aircraft in British Airways’ fleet. It is designed for efficiency, comfort, and safety, with sophisticated systems that can detect and manage technical anomalies. When an emergency declaration is made, it is often a precautionary measure to ensure that any potential issue can be addressed on the ground, where engineers have full access to the aircraft. British Airways has not yet confirmed the exact reason for the emergency, and a detailed inspection will be carried out before the plane is returned to service.Flight BA198 departed Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport slightly behind schedule on August 11, 2025, bound for London Heathrow. The long-haul route typically takes around nine hours, passing over the Arabian Sea, Gulf of Oman, and Persian Gulf before entering European airspace.While cruising near Dubai over the Persian Gulf, the cockpit crew declared an emergency by broadcasting transponder code 7700, a universal signal for an in-flight emergency. Air traffic controllers immediately cleared airspace and coordinated the diversion.The aircraft diverted to Hamad International Airport (DOH) in Doha, Qatar, where it landed safely at approximately 14:00 local time. Emergency ground crews were on standby.After arrival in Doha, the Airbus remained on the ground for about four hours while technical checks were carried out. The nature of the problem, whether mechanical, technical, or health-related, was not disclosed by British Airways. Once cleared, BA198 departed Doha and continued onward to London Heathrow, arriving several hours later than scheduled, at around 22:30 BST.Squawk 7700 is used by pilots to indicate any serious in-flight emergency that requires immediate assistance or priority from air traffic control. Once activated, the transponder alert is visible to control centres and nearby aircraft, triggering safety measures such as route clearance, emergency service standby, and expedited landing proceduresAll aircraft are equipped with transponders that broadcast a four-digit squawk code assigned by controllers. Generally, three codes are universally reserved for emergencies: 7500 for a hijacking, 7600 for a communications failure, and 7700 for a general emergency. Pilots may use 7700 in several situations, including engine problems, medical emergencies, fire onboard, and loss of cabin pressure.When a 7700 code is transmitted, controllers can clear airspace, prioritize the approach, and have emergency services on standby. While it does not necessarily mean the aircraft is in imminent danger, it signals that the crew is managing a situation requiring immediate attention.The safe diversion of British Airways flight BA198 to Doha reinforces the aviation industry’s strong safety-first culture and procedural readiness. While the cause of the emergency remains undisclosed, the coordinated actions of the flight crew, air traffic controllers, and ground teams ensured the wellbeing of all onboard. For passengers, the incident was a reminder of the meticulous safety mechanisms and international teamwork that help keep long-haul flights secure, even in unexpected situations.","BA198 from Mumbai to London issued a 7700 emergency signal while cruising near Dubai over the Persian Gulf.

Authorities across the UAE, including police in Sharjah and Dubai, have issued stern warnings that not only posts but even comments or replies, whether written, audio, video, or live can lead to criminal charges, imprisonment, and hefty fines under the country’s cybercrime and defamation laws.Under Federal Decree Law No. 34 of 2021, amended in 2024, online insults, defamation, and spreading of false or misleading information are criminal offenses. These laws protect individuals, businesses, and public officials from reputational harm caused by defamatory digital content. Authorities emphasize that users often underestimate that even short comment replies or live session remarks are recorded, traceable, and prosecutable.In recent years, the UAE has witnessed a growing number of enforcement actions against individuals who post negative reviews, comments, or defamatory content on social media.Several high-profile cases illustrate the seriousness of these laws in practice. In one instance, a woman was fined after posting a viral Instagram video criticizing a hospital. In another, a man was ordered to pay AED 70,000 in damages for defamatory remarks that harmed a business’s reputation. Legal experts warn that even emotional outbursts or venting personal grievances online can have legal repercussions, as the country’s cybercrime and defamation laws cover a wide range of digital expressions.Authorities have consistently urged residents and visitors to exercise caution in their online behaviour by avoiding personal attacks, abusive language, or insulting remarks, and to instead use official reporting channels when raising complaints. Senior law enforcement officials emphasize that all forms of digital communication, from written posts to comments, replies, live streams, and even private messages are monitored and recorded. Users are reminded to uphold values of respect, tolerance, and coexistence in line with the UAE’s cultural and social norms. The UAE’s National Media Office has further stressed that every social media user acts as an ambassador for the country’s reputation, carrying a responsibility to engage respectfully online. Under existing media regulations, breaches can result in severe administrative measures, including fines of up to AED 1 million or, in the case of media outlets, the closure of the establishment for violations.The UAE’s updated and strictly enforced cybercrime and defamation laws create a robust environment where online negative comments or defamatory remarks are treated as serious offenses. The legal framework aims to balance freedom of expression with protection against digital harm, ensuring peaceful and respectful online interactions in line with the country’s cultural and social values. Internet users and content creators are urged to recognize that every comment and post leaves a digital footprint that can have significant legal consequences, including large fines and imprisonment.","The UAE has intensified its enforcement of laws against negative, abusive, and defamatory comments on social media. Offenders face fines of AED 250,000–500,000, possible imprisonment, and civil claims for damages. Authorities urge respectful digital conduct, stressing that all online activity is traceable and must comply with national values.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123256670,imgsize-53304,width-400,resizemode-4/123256670.jpg"

Mark Sewards, a British MP for Leeds South West and Morley, has launched an AI version of himself that responds to public complaints using his own voice.He introduced the digital assistant, ""AI Mark"", through his official X account. ""This prototype AI model offers my constituents an additional way to engage with their MP on local casework and policy issues.

This is only a prototype, and every request will help train it and make it better.""The AI responds with supportive messages or offers to forward queries to Sewards' team. While the aim is to make it easier for voters to feel heard by a voice that sounds like their MP, a disclaimer on the website reads:“AI Mark is a prototype digital assistant – this is a work in progress and not everything it says should be taken as fact. All responses are AI-generated.”The chatbot has attracted both interest and criticism from AI experts and the media.The Guardian reported that it struggled with accents, failing to recognise messages from people living just a few kilometres from the constituency’s border.Dr Oman from the University of Sheffield told BBC that the growing use of AI in public services poses challenges, especially for older people. “Many don’t realise they’re speaking to a bot and assume it’s a real person.

A chatty parrot with a knack for drug slang has helped British police crack down on a prison drug ring, squawking its way into an unlikely role in a major narcotics bust, authorities revealed this week.The Lancashire Constabulary filed charges against 15 individuals connected to the gang, which purportedly distributed drugs across Blackpool, England, from February 2023 to July 2024. The operation was orchestrated by 35-year-old Adam Garnett whilst serving a prison sentence, Fox News reported.The case unfolded after prison staff discovered multiple mobile phones and Wi-Fi routers during a search of Garnett's cell. This finding led investigators to his alleged associates, including Dalbir Sandhu, Shannon Hilton and Jason Gerrand.Subsequent home searches revealed heroin, crack cocaine, ketamine, cannabis, substantial cash amounts and mobile phones connected to drug trafficking A notable discovery came from Hilton's phone, containing recordings of her parrot ""Mango"" repeating ""two for 25,"" believed to be drug transaction terminology.Additional footage showed the bird interacting with money allegedly obtained through illegal activities.Video:""What's the most talented thing your pet can do? Sit? Give paw? How about speak?"" Lancashire Police wrote in a post on the department's Facebook page.""One drug dealer's parrot learned to say 'two for 25' - a phrase picked up as part of common language used by the organised crime gang run by her boyfriend. Not a phrase you want your parrot squawking when the police come knocking!""Investigators uncovered video communications between Hilton and Garnett, including footage displaying kilogram-sized cocaine packages, occasionally accompanied by drug-referencing song lyrics.Despite his imprisonment, Garnett reportedly maintained central control, directing evidence concealment efforts and maintaining communication with virtually all network members.Det. Sgt. Anthony Alves of Lancashire Police's West Targeted Crime Team commended the results, describing it as a ""coordinated and complex drug operation that extended far beyond prison walls.""""Garnett continued to run his enterprise while incarcerated, using illegal devices to maintain control. I want to thank my team, our partners at the Crown Prosecution Service, and our prosecution team for their dedication to bringing these criminals to justice.""He noted that warrants remain active for Chloe Stott and Ryan Black, requesting public assistance in locating them.Police reported additional evidence from suspects' devices included videos displaying large cash sums, drug-themed rap lyrics and documented narcotic transactions.Garnett received an additional 19 years and six months imprisonment, consecutive to his existing 15-year sentence. Hilton, 29, received 12 years whilst Sandhu, 41, was given 10 years.The operation formed part of Operation Warrior, Lancashire Police's initiative targeting organised crime, drug trafficking, exploitation and violence.

Walls Closing In? Meghan Markle Faces Royal Cold Shoulder Amid New Fears: Reports

Different networks, same idea

Anderson’s calm response

What critics say about Markle’s show

Positive buzz for Anderson

No reaction from Meghan





Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series. The former Baywatch star spoke about the issue on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. When Cohen asked her to rate, on a scale of one to ten, how much Markle’s With Love, Meghan looked like her own Pamela’s Cooking With Love, Anderson answered “One.” She added, “I didn’t invent cooking shows. She’s just doing her thing.”Fans noticed that both shows feature garden scenes, casual kitchen chats, and celebrity guests. Anderson’s trailer came out in October 2024. Markle’s teaser followed three months later. Online threads pointed to similar camera angles and even matching font styles in the titles. Some viewers accused the Duchess of releasing a “frame-for-frame” copy.Pamela’s Cooking With Love is streamed on Amazon Prime. Episodes show Anderson and a guest chef picking vegetables in her Vancouver garden before cooking a meal outdoors. Markle’s eight-part Netflix show centres on simple dishes and home-grown produce in Montecito.Both series mix recipes with lifestyle tips, but Anderson stressed that overlap is normal in food television.Anderson told Cohen she had only seen quick clips of Markle’s programme and did not spend time looking for likenesses. She joked that there is room for anyone who wants to share food and stories on screen. Her relaxed tone cooled much of the online debate.With Love, Meghan drew mixed-to-negative reviews (≈38% on Rotten Tomatoes; 37 on Metacritic). It briefly entered Netflix’s Top 10 in its first week, and mid-year engagement tallies cited by several outlets place it outside Netflix’s Top 300. Even so, Netflix has ordered Season 2.Anderson’s series has earned strong notices and a high user score on IMDb. Executive producer Jesse Fawcett said any comparison is a compliment because it proves their team set a trend others want to follow. Anderson plans to film a second garden season next spring.Markle has not commented on Anderson’s remarks. Sources close to her say she is focused on shooting new episodes and expanding her As Ever lifestyle brand. Observers doubt she will address copy-cat talk directly. They note she has stayed silent through similar critiques from Martha Stewart and Gwyneth Paltrow.Two stars can host cooking shows without a feud. Anderson’s light answer suggests she sees no threat. Unless Markle fires back, the story may cool as fast as it boiled up. For viewers, the choice is simple: prime-time garden meals with Pamela or California comfort food with Meghan. Either way, dinner is served.",Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series.

We must confront them every time,” she added.Her post drew backlash with users online calling her racist and many questioning why she found it offensive and what rules the employees had broken.This incident is not the first time White has faced criticism for similar remarks. A few weeks ago, she posted another tweet targeting Indian and Asian employees at Heathrow, claiming they spoke “not a word of English.” She added that when she asked them to speak English, they called her a “racist.”One user, on her latest post, commented, “Confront people who talk in a different language?

However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109034604,imgsize-54266,width-400,resizemode-4/109034604.jpg"

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Elon Musk vs Sam Altman: The ongoing war of words



It appears that the rivalry between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Tesla CEO Elon Musk is going to enter a new frontier of human brain. As reported by Financial Times, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is co-founding a brain-computer interface startup called Merge Labs. The upcoming startup will compete against Elon Musk’s Neuralink as both the companies will not race to merge humans with artificial intelligence. As reported by Financial Times, Merge Labs is in the process of raising $850 million, with $250 million expected to come from OpenAI’s venture fund.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman will be the co-founder, however he is not said to be involved in day-to-day operations. The startup is reportedly also working with Alex Blania, CEO of Tools for Humanity, Altman’s other venture focused on biometric digital identity.Elon Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 and till now the company has made significant progress in developing brain implants which enable people with paralysis to control devices with the help of their thoughts. The Elon Musk-owned company recently raised $600 million at a $9 billion valuation and is conducting human trials.Merge Labs on the other hand, is reportedly working on less invasive brain interfaces with a strong emphasis on AI-powered enhancements. The focus of the startup is not just medical rehabilitation but broader human-AI integration.“I believe the merge has already started,” Altman wrote in a 2017 blog post. “We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants”.Elon Musk and Sam Altman are fighting again and publicly. In a heated escalation of their ongoing rivalry, Elon Musk and Sam Altman traded barbs over allegations of bias in Apple’s App Store rankings. The fight started after Musk, founder of xAI, posted on Twitter, accusing Apple of manipulating its App Store rankings to favor OpenAI’s ChatGPT, making it “impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1.” Musk labeled this an “unequivocal antitrust violation” and threatened immediate legal action against Apple. At the time, ChatGPT held the top spot on the U.S. App Store’s free apps list, while xAI’s Grok ranked fifth.To this, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman swiftly countered on X, calling Musk’s claims “remarkable” given allegations that Musk manipulates X’s algorithms to boost his own companies and suppress competitors. Altman referenced a 2023 Platformer report alleging Musk tweaked X’s algorithm to prioritize his tweets after a post by President Biden outperformed his. Altman challenged Musk to sign an affidavit denying such practices, promising an apology if Musk complied.","Merge Labs is in the process of raising $850 million, with $250 million expected to come from OpenAI’s venture fund.
