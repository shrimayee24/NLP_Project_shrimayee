Whether one likes it or not, America was built by immigrants, the wretched masses that the Statue of Liberty inscription asks to welcome with open arms. From Albert Einstein to Elon Musk, immigrants made America a great country, and now it looks like they are making America great again (MAGA, as the slogan goes), and this time in artificial intelligence. America’s edge isn’t just its innovation, it's the global brainpower who has been giving an edge to the country for centuries. And nothing makes that clearer than the news out of Meta’s new Superintelligence Lab: 11 top AI researchers hired, and every single one of them is an immigrant.That’s right, not one US undergrad among them. These are elite engineers, model architects, and machine learning pioneers who began their academic journeys in India, China, South Africa, the UK, and Australia. They trained in America’s best labs, built some of the most advanced AI systems at OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic, and now they’ve been snapped up by Zuckerberg to build the next wave of intelligence. If you want to understand why the US leads the world in AI, you don’t need to look at GPUs or model benchmarks. Just look at the passports of the people writing the code.Immigrants have long been the silent engine of Silicon Valley. From coding at Google to architecting cloud infrastructure at Microsoft, they form the backbone of America’s biggest tech empires. A significant number of these engineers hail from India, whose talent pipeline has become essential to the innovation output of the U.S. tech sector. They don’t just fill jobs, they define the direction of the industry. Now, as AI becomes the next great technological frontier, these same minds are shaping the models, algorithms, and safety protocols that will govern its future.

Romantic getaway to a French castle makes headlines before social media shake-up

It seems Cardi B ’s whirlwind romance with New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs might be hitting a rocky patch — at least online. Barely a month after confirming their relationship through a series of intimate Instagram posts, fans were quick to notice that the Grammy-winning rapper has now scrubbed her page of all traces of Diggs.In early June, Cardi B had made her love public, posting affectionate clips of the couple and even joining Stefon Diggs at his fourth annual ""Diggs Day Camp"" at the University of Maryland. However, her sudden Instagram purge has sparked speculation that trouble may be brewing behind the scenes. Diggs, on the other hand, still has photos of Cardi up on his profile, adding further mystery to the sudden social media move.The timing of the Instagram deletion is curious, especially after reports that Diggs recently pulled out all the stops for a luxurious romantic retreat with Cardi. According to The Cut, the four-time Pro Bowl wide receiver rented the Château de Farcheville — a lavish medieval castle just outside Paris — for their private escape. The $12,000-per-night venue features everything from a music room to a wine cellar and spa, making it a fairytale getaway for the high-profile pair.The couple’s romance had been gradually going public since they were first linked back in October 2024. They were spotted celebrating Valentine’s Day together, and again at Madison Square Garden for the NBA Playoffs on May 25. But it wasn’t until Cardi B’s June Instagram posts that fans got official confirmation.While his offseason escapades have grabbed headlines, Diggs will soon need to turn his attention to football. After signing a $69 million, three-year deal with the Patriots in March, all eyes are on his upcoming partnership with rookie quarterback Drake Maye. Training camp opens July 23, and with expectations high, Stefon Diggs’ performance will be crucial in shaping the team’s 2025 season.Also Read: Tom Brady’s surprise wedding date isn’t a new flame—and Gisele Bündchen gives her full approval As for his relationship with Cardi B, it's still unclear whether the Instagram wipe signals a breakup or just a pause on public sharing.

'Feel like a mermaid': River Seine reopens after century-long ban; Parisians rejoice 'childhood dream',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/feel-like-a-mermaid-river-seine-reopens-after-century-long-ban-parisians-rejoice-childhood-dream/articleshow/122278959.cms,"



After more than a century, swimmers returned to the River Seine on Saturday, marking the first official reopening of the iconic waterway for public bathing since 1923.Among the first to take a dip was a 95-year-old Parisian, who joined excited locals at the newly launched Bras Marie swim zone in eastern Paris, one of three designated spots now open to the public.""I'm so happy! I've dreamed of swimming in the Seine for years,"" said Ingrid, stepping carefully into the water in her turquoise-blue swimsuit.Chantal Eyboulet, 61, a Paris-based engineer wearing a fluorescent pink swim cap, shared her joy, “I’ve been waiting 30 years for this.”The seasonal reopening is a key legacy of the Paris 2024 Olympics, for which the Seine underwent an extensive clean-up to host open-water swimming and triathlon events. Roughly €1.4 billion was spent to improve water quality and prepare the river for both athletes and the public.Crowds gathered from 8 am as Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo joined the celebrations, watching swimmers of all ages splash into the river under blue skies. ""It’s a childhood dream to have people swimming in the Seine,"" she said, smiling. “Look at how happy everyone is.”Each site is equipped with lifeguards, changing rooms, showers and beach-style seating.Entry is free and available through the end of August, with capacities ranging from 150 to 300 people.Officials say the water quality is now “exceptional,” according to Ile-de-France prefect Marc Guillaume. Still, strong currents and boat traffic remain a concern. Lifeguards will screen swimmers before allowing independent access, and fines will apply for anyone entering the water outside of designated areas.""I feel like a mermaid,"" said 65-year-old Isabel Bertelot, who lives across the river from the Bercy site. ""I’ve dreamed so many times of swimming across the Seine, whether it was allowed or not. So now it’s great, I don’t even have to cheat!”The return to swimming follows a blistering heatwave in Paris this past week, reinforcing Mayor Hidalgo’s broader climate vision. “Heatwaves are only going to increase,” she said.“Creating safe swim spaces fosters a happier, and undoubtedly more peaceful, life with our fellow citizens,” AFP quoted.President Emmanuel Macron hailed the milestone as a “moment of pride,” referencing Jacques Chirac’s 1988 promise, made during his time as mayor, to make the Seine swimmable again.While heavy rains can still cause sewage overflows and temporary closures, daily water quality flags will inform swimmers. Officials remain optimistic the summer will be drier than the record downpours that plagued some Olympic events.The swimming areas are open to the public free of charge until 31 August.","Swimmers returned to the River Seine on Saturday, marking the first official reopening of the waterway for public bathing since 1923.

Lacuesta emphasizes that proximity to public transport is one of the most important factors for budget-conscious renters.“Affordable options for bachelors and job seekers tend to be in older or outer communities, where rents are lower. However, access to public transport is still essential. Living near a Metro or bus station can make a significant difference in convenience and reduce commuting costs,” said Lacuesta.He highlights the following neighborhoods for their excellent transport connectivity:Affordable living in these areas allows renters to maintain proximity to the heart of the city while reducing their transportation expenses.In 2025, flexible leases and shared living spaces are becoming more common, providing a viable option for newcomers who may not yet want to commit to long-term contracts.El Khatib mentions that co-living operators are filling the gap in the market for transient workers and expats. Areas like Dubai Marina, JLT, and Business Bay now feature monthly or quarterly rental agreements that often include furnishings, Wi-Fi, and utilities.“Startups like Hive Coliv, Nomad Homes, and The Cohost are addressing the growing demand for flexible, community-based living options,” said El Khatib. ""These setups are especially attractive to young professionals and expats who need short-term housing without a long-term commitment.""Lacuesta agrees, noting that platforms such as Dubizzle, Property Finder, and Facebook Marketplace are flooded with listings for shared apartments, rooms, and even weekly stays. For those who are not yet ready for an annual lease, these options offer much-needed flexibility.For those seeking furnished, serviced co-living spaces, Nest by Arada and Uninest in Sharjah and Ajman offer fully furnished units with flexible terms. These spaces cater specifically to students and young professionals, providing a hassle-free living experience.When renting a budget studio, tenants can expect basic amenities and furnishings. According to both experts, typical budget-friendly studios include:A typical unfurnished budget studio can cost anywhere from Dh1,500 to Dh3,500 per month, depending on the location.For instance, Deira offers studios ranging from Dh2,800 to Dh3,500, while Sharjah’s Al Nahda offers more affordable options, starting at Dh1,800 per month.One great deal found on Property Finder is a studio in Al Murar, near Diplomat Hotel, available for Dh26,000 per year. This unit is just 10 minutes away from the Metro and is surrounded by essential services like banks, restaurants, and clinics, making it ideal for job seekers looking for convenience and affordability.Both experts caution against opting for partitioned rooms, which are often found in high-density neighborhoods but may not meet safety standards or municipal regulations. These makeshift setups typically involve curtain partitions, violating housing codes and presenting safety risks.“Always ensure that the property is Ejari-registered,” said Lacuesta. ""If you're renting a full unit, confirm with the landlord whether partitions are officially approved.""Dubai’s rental market continues to evolve, offering a wide range of affordable housing options, flexible lease terms, and community-focused living spaces. Whether you’re a bachelor, job seeker, or newcomer, there are plenty of affordable neighborhoods and rental solutions available to suit your needs in 2025.By being mindful of location, rental terms, and the amenities offered, you can find the right balance between budget and convenience in your new home in the UAE.","In 2025, bachelors and newcomers can find studio rentals in the UAE ranging from Dh20,000 to Dh40,000 annually in key affordable areas. With rental regulations tightening, finding affordable yet legal housing is becoming a challenge. Industry experts shared their insights on where to find affordable housing in Dubai and neighboring emirates, such as Sharjah and Ajman.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122279394,imgsize-1398679,width-400,resizemode-4/122279394.jpg"

A Troubling Pattern: Tragedies Prompt Renewed Focus on Pool Safety

Dubai Municipality’s Regulations: What Pool Owners Must Do

1. Defined Roles and Responsibilities:

Pool Owners: Pool owners are required to register their pools with Dubai Municipality before construction or use. They must ensure that the pool meets all design, safety, and hygiene standards set by the authorities. Additionally, owners are responsible for maintaining the pool’s structural integrity and ensuring it operates safely through regular upkeep.

Contractors and Manufacturers: Contractors and manufacturers have the responsibility to build pools according to established safety codes. They must use non-hazardous materials to guarantee safety and provide proper safety labels to inform users of potential risks. Compliance with these standards is crucial for preventing accidents.

Residents and Pool Users: Residents and users of pools must supervise children at all times to prevent drowning and other accidents. They should follow strict hygiene protocols to maintain water quality and cleanliness. Moreover, securing pools with enclosures, safety covers, or nets when not in use is essential to protect young children and pets from accidental falls.

As more villa communities expand across the UAE and private pools become increasingly popular, a growing public safety concern has emerged especially the rising number of drowning incidents involving children under five. Health authorities and civic officials are now urging residents to take stricter precautions and adhere to comprehensive safety regulations introduced by Dubai Municipality.Recent months have witnessed several tragic drowning cases that have cast a spotlight on the dangers associated with private pools, even when water bodies seem small or harmless.On April 5, six-year-old Ayanvit Chhaparwal, a finalist on UAE’s Got Talent, died in Abu Dhabi after falling into a swimming pool and suffering a head injury. Two month later, on June 27, a 15-year-old Sudanese boy drowned while swimming with friends at the UAE University Olympic Pool in Al Ain.In Dubai, an Indian family is now facing over Dh100,000 (approximately US $27,230) in medical bills after their son, Ali, nearly drowned in a community pool. The accident happened just days after the family moved to the UAE in search of a better life.Similarly, on April 4, a two-year-old child tragically lost his life after drowning in a bucket of water at his family home in Ras Al Khaimah’s Sidrouh neighbourhood, a harrowing reminder that even minimal amounts of water can be fatal.Officials from Dubai’s Health and Safety Department, which investigates such incidents, revealed that most local drowning cases involve unsupervised children, underscoring the critical role of adult supervision.According to the World Health Organisation, drowning remains one of the leading causes of accidental deaths globally, a trend that’s mirrored across the UAE.To mitigate risk and ensure residential pools are safe for all users, particularly children, Dubai Municipality has issued comprehensive safety regulations that apply to all private pools in residential villas. These rules cover any water feature deeper than 300mm, including hot tubs, inflatable pools, and prefabricated spa pools.Here are the key responsibilities and requirements as laid out by the authorities:All private pools must be registered with Dubai Municipality before construction begins. Any modifications, such as adding slides or diving boards, also require prior municipal approval.Safety around private pools begins with proper fencing and barriers. All fences must be at least 1.2 metres high, designed to be child-resistant, climb-proof, and free of gaps that children could squeeze through. Additionally, pool covers and safety nets are strongly recommended, especially in homes with young children. These covers must meet the ASTM F1346-91 international safety standards and be sturdy enough to support the weight of two adults and one child in case of emergency. It is also important to keep rescue tools like pool brushes or leaf scoops nearby, ensuring quick access if needed.Access to the pool must be carefully controlled to prevent accidental entry by children. Gates and entrances should open outward, be self-closing and self-latching, with locks installed at least 1.5 metres above ground to keep them out of children’s reach. The use of garage doors or automated perimeter gates for pool access is strictly prohibited to avoid unsupervised entry. Windows overlooking pools require fixed security screens or limiters that prevent openings wider than 100mm. Balconies close to pool areas must also have child-proof barriers installed for added safety.Maintaining clean, healthy pool water is essential. Owners must conduct daily testing of water for pH levels, chlorine, and temperature, with more thorough bi-weekly checks for additional parameters. Furthermore, microbiological testing is mandatory every two months to ensure compliance with health standards. For emergencies, CPR instructions must be clearly displayed near the pool, alongside important contact numbers for ambulance, police, and civil defence services. A well-stocked first aid kit and rescue equipment, such as poles or hooks, should always be within easy reach to respond promptly in case of an accident.While Dubai Municipality’s regulations set a robust safety framework, the most critical element remains active adult supervision, officials say.“Safety begins at home,” the municipality stresses. Teaching children how to swim and staying vigilant whenever they are near water are the most effective ways to prevent tragedy.For further details on compliance or to register a pool, residents are encouraged to contact the Health and Safety Department of Dubai Municipality via:","Dubai Municipality has issued comprehensive safety regulations that apply to all private pools in residential villas.

Tyres: The Critical Contact Point With the Road

The Five-Year Tyre Rule

The Deadly Danger of Leaving Children in Cars

RTA’s Essential Tips for Safe Summer Driving

Ensure your vehicle’s air conditioning is functioning properly and effectively cooling the interior during hot days.

Check engine oil and radiator coolant levels regularly, especially in summer when engine temperatures can spike.

Maintain correct tyre pressure and inspect tyre condition carefully to avoid blowouts caused by high temperatures.

Keep your brake system clean and well-maintained; replace worn brake components to ensure optimal braking performance.

Keep the vehicle tidy and clean, this helps with early fault detection and prolongs the vehicle’s lifespan. Always ensure windscreens, windows, and headlights are clean for clear visibility.

Avoid parking under direct sunligt for extended periods. Whenever possible, park in shaded areas to protect the vehicle from extreme heat damage.

With summer temperatures reaching dangerous highs, the RTA’s campaign serves as a crucial reminder that simple preventive measures can save lives on the roads.





As the UAE enters the peak of summer with temperatures soaring up to 50°C, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has issued an urgent reminder for motorists to conduct routine vehicle checks and servicing. The goal is to prevent accidents and ensure the safety of all road users during the harshest months of the year.In coordination with the Ministry of Interior and Dubai Police, the RTA has launched its annual campaign titled ‘Summer Without Accidents’, emphasizing precautionary measures to avoid traffic incidents caused by the extreme weather.Ahmed Al Khzaimy, director of traffic at RTA’s Traffic and Roads Agency, emphasized the importance of simple yet effective maintenance:“(We) urge all motorists to conduct regular and routine maintenance checks, including a quick inspection before setting off. This should involve a visual check of tyre pressure, engine oil and coolant levels, and ensuring there are no oil or water leaks beneath the vehicle.”He explained that such quick inspections could help prevent unexpected breakdowns, which tend to increase the risk of traffic accidents and negatively affect road safety across the Emirate.Authorities have particularly stressed the need for motorists to check their tyres carefully.Tyres are the only part of a vehicle that comes in direct contact with the road, and under the intense summer heat, worn-out or old tyres are at risk of bursting. Such incidents can lead to severe road accidents with disastrous consequences.Highlighting the dangers, Abu Dhabi authorities shared a video showing multiple vehicles, including a truck and several cars, losing control due to damaged tyres. The vehicles skidded across the roads, crashed into barriers, overturned, or sustained significant damage, all posing additional hazards to other road users.RTA regulations strictly prohibit tyres that are older than five years from being used on UAE roads. This rule aims to reduce tyre-related accidents, which spike during the summer months.Speaking to local news media outlet Khaleej Time, Thomas Edelmann, founder and managing director of RoadSafetyUAE, said:“The number of vehicles parked on the hard shoulder with tyre defects increases in summer. Tyre debris, mainly from decomposing commercial vehicle tyres, can be seen more during the hot summer months.”Edelmann added:“The solution is to continuously educate motorists about the importance of tyre safety and maintenance. Tyres must be procured, fitted and maintained properly, especially during summer.”One of the most alarming risks highlighted in the ‘Summer Without Accidents’ campaign is the danger of leaving children unattended inside vehicles. The RTA warned that children left in cars can suffer from suffocation and death within minutes, even if the air conditioning is on.Ahmed Al Khzaimy strongly urged parents:“Not to leave their children in the car, not even for a short period.”He stressed that the air conditioning does not provide sufficient protection in a sealed environment where temperatures can rise rapidly and dangerously.To help motorists stay safe during the hot summer months, the RTA shared the following practical tips:",Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has issued an urgent reminder for motorists to conduct routine vehicle checks and servicing.

Dubai’s expansive desert allows heat to escape freely. Skyscrapers and dense urban structures in the city, however, trap heat and block wind, creating what scientists call the “urban heat island effect.” Better Air Circulation: Gentle breezes often flow across the desert during the evenings. In contrast, buildings in the city obstruct natural air currents, making the urban environment feel stagnant and warmer.

The Science Behind the Desert’s Cooling Effect

Desert Temperature Drop : After a blazing day with temperatures soaring past 40°C, the desert can cool down by as much as 10 to 15°C at night. This makes for a surprisingly pleasant evening environment.

How to Experience the Cool of Dubai’s Desert

1. Evening Safaris and Overnight Escapes

2. Activities and Tips for Cooler Hours

Discover the Desert’s Natural Cool





Dubai is known worldwide for its iconic skyline, luxurious lifestyle, and relentless summer heat. But many are surprised to learn that the vast desert surrounding the city often feels cooler, especially in the evenings. While it may seem counterintuitive, given the desert’s direct exposure to the sun, scientific and environmental factors explain why escaping to the sands can be more refreshing than staying in the city.This article dives into the real reasons behind this phenomenon, explaining everything from urban heat effects to ancient Bedouin wisdom, and highlighting how to enjoy the desert’s cooling charm during the UAE’s warmest months.Despite the extreme daytime heat in both city and desert, the difference in nighttime temperature is stark. Here's why:The temperature drop after sunset in the desert is not a fluke, it’s the result of natural geographic and atmospheric conditions.The desert’s cooler side comes alive after sunset. Evening and night safaris offer a refreshing break from daytime heat, with activities like camel riding, dune bashing, and sandboarding feeling much more pleasant.Overnight desert camps take the experience further, combining stargazing, bonfires, and Emirati cuisine under the open sky. Bedouin-style tents, traditionally made from breathable animal hair, stay cool during the day and warm at night, a testament to centuries-old desert living.To enjoy the desert comfortably, plan activities like morning hot air balloon rides, wildlife spotting, or stargazing in the evening when temperatures are lower. Wear breathable fabrics like linen or cotton, stay well-hydrated, and bring a light jacket, as nights can get surprisingly cold. With the right timing and preparation, Dubai’s desert becomes a peaceful, cool escape just outside the city.While Dubai’s urban heat can be relentless, the desert just outside the city offers a natural, surprising reprieve. Thanks to quick cooling sand, breezy nights, and open skies, the desert remains an oasis of calm, even in the height of summer.Whether you're planning a romantic night under the stars, a cultural safari, or just a refreshing evening away from the heat, the Dubai desert proves to be more than just sand dunes, it's a living, breathing example of nature’s ability to balance extremes.So next time the city heat gets too much, consider heading into the desert. The cool, quiet night awaits.","Dubai’s expansive desert allows heat to escape freely. Skyscrapers and dense urban structures in the city, however, trap heat and block wind.

The NEOM project, launched under Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, is a $500 billion megacity initiative that aims to leapfrog traditional infrastructure and social models by integrating cutting-edge technologies, sustainability, and human-centric design.Championed by His Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman , NEOM represents a new frontier in imagining cities as engines of innovation and ecological harmony. From renewable energy to floating industrial districts and luxury mountain retreats, NEOM is unlike anything the world has seen before.The name NEOM itself is a blend of two words: ""neo"", meaning “new” in Greek, and ""Mustaqbal"", Arabic for “future,"" thus, NEOM means “a new future.” It’s not just a city, it’s a vision to create sustainable, tech-forward, and people-centric environments that can solve the biggest challenges facing humanity.NEOM is strategically situated in Saudi Arabia’s Tabuk Province, bordering Egypt and Jordan, and covers over 26,500 square kilometers (10,200 square miles), an area larger than some countries.Its location offers direct access to global trade routes through the Red Sea and Suez Canal, positioning it as a future hub for logistics, tourism, and innovation across Asia, Europe, and Africa.NEOM forms a central part of Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia’s national transformation program aimed at economic diversification, reducing dependency on oil, and fostering a vibrant society and thriving economy.Rather than being a single monolithic city, NEOM is a network of multiple specialized developments, each serving a unique function and contributing to the broader ecosystem.Announced in 2021, The Line is the centerpiece of NEOM’s bold urban vision, a 170-kilometer-long, 200-meter-wide, and 500-meter-tall linear city consisting of two parallel skyscrapers stretching across the desert. Designed to be entirely zero-carbon, it will be powered by 100% renewable energy such as solar and wind. Every essential service will be within a five-minute walk, enhancing walkability and quality of life. A high-speed, AI-powered transit system will enable residents to travel from end to end in just 20 minutes. Green spaces, including a central park and continuous green corridor, will run the entire length. The city will integrate smart mobility solutions like autonomous vehicles and drone logistics, all while maintaining compact density to preserve 95% of NEOM’s surrounding natural environment. This groundbreaking project reimagines the future of urban living.Launched in 2021, Oxagon is NEOM’s innovative industrial zone and is set to become the world’s largest floating structure. It is designed around Industry 4.0 and circular economy principles, emphasizing sustainable and tech-driven manufacturing. The city will feature a next-generation port and an integrated supply chain system, fully powered by renewable energy sources. It will also house a cutting-edge research and innovation campus, focusing on clean technologies. Oxagon supports NEOM’s ambition to be a global leader in advanced manufacturing, logistics, and green innovation.Inaugurated in 2022, Sindalah marks NEOM’s debut as a premium destination in the Red Sea. This luxury island retreat is envisioned as a sophisticated hub for yachting, leisure, and hospitality. It will create 3,500 new jobs in tourism and offer an exclusive mix of beach clubs, upscale resorts, and marinas. Sindalah’s design harmonizes luxury with environmental sustainability, setting new standards for eco-conscious resort development.Trojena is a striking mountain destination located at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,600 meters and spans 60 square kilometers. Designed as a year-round adventure tourism hub, it features ski slopes with sub-zero temperatures in winter, making it the first of its kind in the region. Trojena will also include a mountain amphitheater, luxury hotels, and lifestyle retail spaces. Emphasizing sustainability, it incorporates green architecture and outdoor wellness facilities that embrace the natural terrain.Launched in 2023, Leyja offers a transformative approach to tourism with three uniquely themed hotels: the Adventure Hotel, the Oasis Hotel (integrated into natural rock formations), and the Wellness Hotel (featuring mirrored exteriors). These establishments are equipped with amenities like spas, helipads, and scenic hiking trails. Leyja’s design prioritizes biodiversity and ecological restoration, embodying the concept of regenerative tourism.Introduced in 2023, Epicon is a futuristic luxury destination blending high-end beachfront villas, exclusive resorts, and upscale residences. The project is centered around ecological harmony and personal well-being, offering features such as immersive architecture, world-class spas, and a range of water sports. Epicon aims to be a haven for those seeking both luxury and a sustainable lifestyle.Unveiled in 2023, Utamo is envisioned as a next-generation performance and event venue that merges digital technology, art, and nature. Designed to host global artists and immersive shows, Utamo redefines what a cultural space can be. With cutting-edge audio-visual experiences integrated into natural surroundings, it serves as a theatrical playground for creativity and innovation.While NEOM is inspiring, its scale and speed have drawn scrutiny:Several top-tier global architecture and engineering firms are contributing, including: AECOM, Zaha Hadid Architects, LAVA, UNStudio, Aedas, Bureau Proberts, Luca Dini Design (for Sindalah), Adjaye Associates, Pei Cobb Freed & Partners and Studio Fuksas (presumed contributors). Their roles span everything from masterplanning to designing specific resorts and urban clusters.Thefuture is being built now. NEOM is more than a city, it's a vision to reshape civilization for a changing planet. As the most ambitious urban project of the 21st century, NEOM aspires to prove that technology, sustainability, and human well-being can converge at scale.","NEOM is a $500 billion megacity initiative that aims to leapfrog traditional infrastructure and social models by integrating cutting-edge technologies, sustainability, and human-centric design.

Should work start at 6am in UAE? Here’s what some residents say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/should-work-start-at-6am-in-uae-heres-what-some-residents-say/articleshow/122240359.cms,"esidents in the UAE say starting work at 6am could improve focus, health, and work-life balance/image: pixabay

Early Risers Want to Finish Early

Experts Weigh In: Health and Productivity Benefits

Flexibility Is Key





Across the UAE, a growing number of residents are advocating for the workday to begin as early as 6am. Many say that aligning work hours with their natural morning routines, such as waking for Fajr prayer or exercising, would allow them to finish work earlier in the day. This shift could offer more time for rest, errands, and family, while also potentially boosting productivity and reducing screen fatigue, particularly during the scorching summer months.For Dubai resident Amina Al Hammadi, the day starts well before sunrise. Speaking to local news outlet Khaleej Times, she said that she wakes up for the Fajr prayer at around 4:03am.“I wake up for Fajr around 4.03am these days,” Amina said. “By the time I’m done with my prayer and breakfast, I’m wide awake and ready. But I still have to wait two, sometimes three hours before work starts. I wish I could just get going at 6am and finish early.”Amina believes that starting soon after Fajr prayer would enable her to complete her workday by 2pm, freeing up the rest of the afternoon for family time, rest, or errands. She pointed out that this schedule would be especially beneficial in the summer months, when the heat can be draining by midday.“In the summer, especially, the heat drains you by the afternoon. It would be so much better if we’re done by then,” she added.Similarly, Alex, an American expat working in sales in Dubai, starts his day with a run at 5am followed by a gym session. He shared with KT:“By 6am I’m fully alert, I’ve had my workout, my coffee, and I feel most productive. But I waste so much of that energy waiting for the workday to start. I’d rather finish by 2pm or 3pm and then have time for lunch, maybe a nap, and enjoy the evening.”Alex also noted the impact on screen fatigue. “In sales, you're constantly emailing or on Zoom. If I can frontload all that in the morning and get it over with, I’ll be sharper and less burned out.”While some UAE companies have adopted flexible schedules, a standard early start remains uncommon. Dr. Reem Al Marzouqi, a Dubai-based occupational health specialist, explained the scientific benefits of matching work hours with natural energy peaks.“People who wake up early tend to have higher cortisol levels in the morning, which boosts alertness and focus,” Dr. Al Marzouqi told KT. “Starting the workday earlier taps into that natural hormonal peak. Over time, this can enhance productivity and reduce dependence on stimulants like caffeine.”She also emphasized how earlier work hours can protect employees from the extreme heat typical of UAE summers.“Finishing by early afternoon means avoiding peak heat exposure, especially for those who commute or work in the field. It also opens up more usable daylight hours for rest, family or physical activity,” she explained.From a psychological standpoint, Dr. Al Marzouqi said earlier finishing times could reduce burnout caused by extended screen time late into the evening.“Working until 6pm or 7pm, then spending the evening on phones or laptops, affects circadian rhythms. Earlier wrap-up times give people a natural pause and allow their brains to disconnect before bed,” she said.Despite the benefits, Dr. Al Marzouqi cautioned that early starts are not a one-size-fits-all solution.“Some people are wired differently. For night owls, pushing a 6am start might backfire and increase fatigue. Flexibility is key, and employers should consider offering multiple shift options where possible,” she advised.She suggested companies experiment with pilot programs to find the best fit for both employees and business operations.“Even something simple like a 6am to 2pm trial twice a week can help identify what works best for both employee energy levels and business needs,” she concluded.","A growing number of UAE residents are advocating for the workday to begin as early as 6am.

Dubai: 10-year-old reports father’s abuse through Dubai Police smart app,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-10-year-old-reports-fathers-abuse-through-dubai-police-smart-app/articleshow/122236110.cms,"A 10-year-old boy in Dubai used the Dubai Police Smart App to report his father’s abuse, leading to swift intervention and ongoing support/ Image: File

A Cry for Help Through Technology:



Support from School Social Worker:



Father’s Justification and the Law’s Intervention:



Ongoing Support and Monitoring







In a heartbreaking yet courageous act, a 10-year-old boy in Dubai recently reported his father for repeated physical abuse, utilizing the Dubai Police smart app to seek help. The boy, identified only as A.A. , had been suffering in silence for months, unable to understand the reasons behind the physical punishments or to speak out about the pain he endured. His story, which has now been shared by Dubai Police, serves as a crucial reminder to the public that help is always available and that no child should suffer in silence.A.A.’s situation came to light when he was discreetly able to report his father’s cruelty via the Dubai Police smart app. Although the boy did not fully comprehend why he was being singled out for punishment, especially since his younger siblings were not subjected to the same treatment, the constant beatings left visible bruises on his body and a deep emotional scar. The pain was becoming unbearable, and he feared his classmates would notice. This fear, however, did not stop him from reaching out for help through the app, one of the many confidential channels available for reporting abuse.A.A.’s journey toward safety and healing began when his school noticed troubling signs. Teachers observed that the boy was struggling academically and showing physical signs of abuse. It was a school social worker who gently built trust with A.A. and, after some time, helped him feel comfortable enough to report the abuse through the police app. Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Ali Al Matrooshi, Director of the Child and Women Protection Department at Dubai Police, emphasized the importance of the school's role in identifying signs of abuse and supporting the child in coming forward.Dr. Al Matrooshi stated, “The child was afraid to speak up, but the bruises on his body and the fear on his face spoke volumes.”After receiving the report, Dubai Police acted swiftly, calling in the boy’s father for questioning. During this process, the father admitted to physically punishing his son but insisted that he never intended to cause harm. According to the father, his strict discipline was meant to “toughen up” his son, similar to the way he himself was raised. However, this justification was met with a firm response from the police.Dr. Al Matrooshi explained, “He thought that being strict would prepare his son for life, but instead, it left the child feeling alone, afraid, and falling behind in school.”The police made it clear to the father that such methods of discipline were not only damaging but also illegal under the UAE’s child protection laws. He was warned that corporal punishment and similar forms of abuse are punishable by law. The father expressed regret and promised to change his behavior, pledging to adopt more appropriate methods of parenting.The police have assured that A.A. will receive the necessary emotional support and counseling, in collaboration with social services. Dr. Al Matrooshi reassured the public that Dubai Police are committed to protecting children, providing support, and helping families heal. ""We are here to protect children, listen to them, and help families heal,"" he said.The case serves as a powerful reminder of the resources available to victims of abuse in the UAE. In line with the UAE’s Wadeema Law, which protects child rights, the General Department of Human Rights urges anyone aware of abuse to report it immediately, through the police app, website, or hotline (901). The Child Oasis Center at Al Twar police headquarters is also available for those who need in-person assistance.","A 10-year-old boy in Dubai recently reported his father for repeated physical abuse.

A Quiet Stroll Through London

The Royal Family's Strong Connection to London

The Summer 2024 Visit: A More Formal Occasion





Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, was recently spotted in London, where videos of his casual walk through the city have gained attention on social media platforms like TikTok.On July 2, 2025, several videos surfaced online showing Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum casually walking through London. In one clip, he was seen strolling down the city’s streets, exuding his usual calm and composed demeanor. The ruler, without any apparent security entourage or fanfare, appeared completely at ease, blending into the vibrant London environment with little attention.Another video captured Sheikh Mohammed entering a building lobby in the upscale Knightsbridge area. His visit was brief and low-key, reflecting his preference for simplicity and privacy while abroad.Perhaps the most engaging video was captured at a traffic light, where Sheikh Mohammed was seen waiting in his car. A passerby noticed him, waved, and the ruler responded with a brief wave of his own. The interaction was fleeting but highlighted his approachable and down-to-earth nature. The user who shared the video added the caption: ""POV: Chatting with the ruler of Dubai while waiting for a traffic light!"" This light-hearted moment quickly gained traction online, with many viewers noting the ruler’s openness during the casual encounter.The UAE royal family, especially Sheikh Mohammed, has a long-standing relationship with London. Over the years, they have frequently visited the city for both official engagements and personal vacations. London’s cosmopolitan atmosphere, coupled with its strong ties to the UAE, makes it a popular destination for many members of the royal family.In the past, Sheikh Mohammed’s visits have often drawn attention from fans and media alike. His preference for privacy while traveling, however, remains unchanged. The ruler has continued to enjoy his visits without excessive public display, often leaving his presence unnoticed or only becoming known after videos or photos are shared on social media platforms.Sheikh Mohammed’s 2024 trip to London was marked by a more formal event. During that visit, he became the first official guest at the opening of Parker’s London, the UK branch of the popular Dubai-born restaurant chain. His visit was considered a significant moment for the Emirati brand, which proudly shared images of the visit online, underscoring the ruler’s support for local businesses and talent on the international stage.Despite the grandeur of the occasion, Sheikh Mohammed’s presence remained humble, embodying his characteristic simplicity and grace. His continued support for homegrown Emirati talent abroad has become a signature part of his leadership and influence, further cementing his reputation as a grounded leader with a global vision.","Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum was recently spotted in London.

Safety and Nightlife: UAE Cities Shine Globally

The Rise of Noctourism: Travel After Dark

Innovations in Nighttime Experiences: Dubai Leads the Way





A recent study by UK-based travel agency Travelbag has ranked Dubai as the third most scenic city in the world after dark, with Abu Dhabi also making the list at 12th place. The report highlights both UAE cities as global leaders not only in their nighttime beauty but also in safety for nighttime explorers.According to the Travelbag study, Abu Dhabi holds the distinction of being the safest city in the world to explore at night. Dubai also ranks highly, placing among the top three safest cities globally after sunset. This recognition underscores the strong emphasis both cities place on security and creating safe environments for residents and tourists alike.The study examined a range of factors including nightlife offerings and the quality of the urban environment at night. Dubai boasts 190 venues that stay open late, catering to night owls and tourists looking for evening entertainment. However, the city does face challenges with noise and light pollution, scoring 52.58 out of 100 on this scale.Abu Dhabi, on the other hand, has fewer late-night venues, with 62 establishments open late. It recorded a slightly lower pollution rating of 47, reflecting a quieter, less intense nighttime environment.This report taps into a broader trend known as ""noctourism,"" travel experiences and activities designed for after sunset. Booking.com predicts that nighttime travel will be one of the top trends in 2025, with tourists increasingly seeking unique adventures like stargazing and cosmic events in areas with minimal light pollution.Such trends are reflected in Dubai’s growing offerings. Many tours now focus exclusively on nighttime sightseeing, a practical response to the city's hot daytime temperatures. Tour agencies promote night tours that let visitors enjoy Dubai’s spectacular cityscape illuminated under the stars.Late-night desert safaris have also surged in popularity. Travelbag’s research notes a 22 percent jump in searches for night safaris, as tourists seek cooler and more atmospheric desert experiences after dark.To enhance night activities and provide comfort during hot summer months, Dubai Municipality has introduced “night swimming” at three public beaches. This initiative extends beach hours into the cooler night, allowing residents and visitors to enjoy swimming and beach activities without the intensity of daytime heat.These measures, along with the thriving nightlife scene, showcase Dubai’s commitment to making nighttime tourism safe, accessible, and enjoyable.This detailed report was compiled from Travelbag’s latest study, as referenced by multiple news outlets covering travel and urban lifestyle trends.","Dubai and Abu Dhabi ranked among the top three safest cities globally after sunset.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

“There are people sitting in our office in King’s Cross, London, working, and collaborating with AI to design drugs for cancer. That’s happening right now.”

“The next big milestone is actually going out to clinical trials, starting to put these things into human beings. We’re staffing up now. We’re getting very close,”

“This was the inspiration for Isomorphic Labs. It really demonstrates that we could do something very foundational in AI that could help unlock drug discovery.”

“We identify an unmet need, and we start our own drug design programs. We develop those, put them into human clinical trials… we haven’t got that yet, but we’re making good progress,”

“We’re trying to do all these things: speed them up, reduce the cost, but also really improve the chance that we can be successful. “One day we hope to be able to say — well, here’s a disease, and then click a button and out pops the design for a drug to address that disease.

iOS 26 Beta 2 Hands-On: Apple Finally Does It

Google DeepMind 's drug discovery arm, Isomorphic Labs, is “ready"" to begin human trials of its AI-designed drugs . In an interview with Fortune, Colin Murdoch , President of Isomorphic Labs and Google DeepMind’s Chief Business Officer, said that the company is “getting very close” to starting human trials of these drugs. This development signifies a potential step for Isomorphic Labs after years of work on its AI-assisted drug designing. Isomorphic Labs was established as a separate entity from DeepMind in 2021. Its foundation stems from AlphaFold , a notable AI system developed by DeepMind, recognised for its ability to predict protein structures with considerable accuracy.During an interview with Fortune in Paris, Murdoch said:he added.Isomorphic Labs, the company that spun out from DeepMind in 2021, originated from AlphaFold, an AI system known for accurately predicting protein structures.Over time, AlphaFold evolved to model interactions between proteins and molecules like DNA and drugs, significantly advancing its utility in drug discovery and accelerating the development of new medicines.Talking about AlphaFold, Murdoch highlighted:In 2024, Isomorphic Labs partnered with Novartis and Eli Lilly after releasing AlphaFold 3. By April 2025, it had raised $600 million in its first external funding round led by Thrive Capital.These moves support its goal of creating a “world-class drug design engine” that combines AI and pharma expertise to develop medicines more efficiently.Alongside supporting existing drug programs, the company is also developing its candidates in fields like oncology and immunology for future licensing.Murdoch explained.Currently, pharma companies invest millions in drug development, often with only a 10% success rate in trials. Murdoch aims to use AlphaFold’s technology to significantly boost these odds, ideally reaching a point where researchers can be fully confident in a drug’s effectiveness before human trials begin.Murdoch continued.","Isomorphic Labs was established as a separate entity from DeepMind in 2021.

Brenda Romero’s complete statement on Twitter

Romero Games , the studio co-founded by industry legends Brenda and John Romero , has been forced to lay off staff following a sudden decision by their publisher, Microsoft, to cancel an unannounced game. The husband-and-wife duo, known for popular titles like Doom, Quake, and Empire of Sin, confirmed the layoffs but did not disclose the number of employees affected or the specific project that was shelved. The news comes amid Microsoft’s announcement of 9,100 layoffs across its gaming divisions, impacting studios such as Raven Software (Call of Duty), Turn 10 (Forza), Rare’s Everwild team, and King (Candy Crush).The abrupt cancellation and job cuts have sent shockwaves through the gaming community, with fans and industry peers mourning the loss of what many believed was a promising project from the storied studio. Neither Romero Games nor Microsoft has provided further details about the canceled title.Microsoft also canceled Perfect Dark and shuttered its developer, The Initiative. An employee at Romero Games, speaking anonymously to GamesBeat, identified Microsoft as the publisher behind the canceled title. “It’s a very sad day,” the employee shared in a statement. “Romero Games fell victim to the Microsoft layoffs . This was the best team I’ve ever worked with and my dream job, gone just like that. It was a great project, and it’s heartbreaking to see it end. It’s nothing less than tragic.”John Romero took to Twitter to express his sorrow, writing, “These people are the best I’ve ever worked with, and I’m sorry to say that our game and our studio were also affected.” On LinkedIn, he praised the laid-off employees, urging other studios to hire them.“We have some difficult news to share. Last night, we learned that our publisher has canceled funding for our game along with several other unannounced projects at other studios. This was a strategic decision made at a high level within the publisher, well above our visibility or control. We deeply wish there had been something, anything, we could have done to prevent this outcome.This absolutely isn’t a reflection of our team’s work, performance, or the quality of the project itself. We hit every milestone on time, every time, consistently received high praise and easily passed all our internal gates. We are incredibly proud of the work being done, and of the talented team behind it. The best we’ve worked with.We’re currently evaluating next steps and working quickly to support our team. Many of us have worked together for more than a decade, some for over 20 years. It’s an extremely difficult day, and we’re heartbroken that it’s come to this.

Xbox Game Studios Executive Producer Matt Turnbull has recommended that recently laid-off Microsoft employees use AI chatbots to cope with job loss, offering specific prompts to help workers navigate unemployment. Turnbull's since-deleted LinkedIn post suggested using tools like ChatGPT and Copilot to ""help reduce the emotional and cognitive load that comes with job loss.""Turnbull’s recommendation comes as Microsoft cuts 9,100 employees across the company, with Xbox divisions particularly affected by studio closures and game cancellations. ""These are really challenging times, and if you're navigating a layoff or even quietly preparing for one, you're not alone and you don't have to go it alone,"" Turnbull wrote in his original post.The exec provided detailed AI prompt suggestions for affected workers, including career planning assistance: ""Act as a career coach. I've been laid off from a [role] in the game industry. Help me build a 30-day plan to regroup, research new roles, and start applying without burning out.""His recommendations extended to emotional support, suggesting workers ask AI: ""I'm struggling with imposter syndrome after being laid off.

Ban on Chinese apps across the world

Taiwan's National Security Bureau (NSB) has warning for users of Chinese apps. In an advisory, NSB said that China-developed apps like RedNote (Xiaohongshu), Weibo, TikTok, WeChat and Baidu Cloud pose security risks due to excessive data collection and data transfer to China. The alert reportedly comes following an inspection of these apps carried out in coordination with the Taiwan's Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) and the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) under the National Police Agency.NSB said that the results indicate the existence of security issues, including excessive data collection and privacy infringement. It further warned, ""The public is advised to exercise caution when choosing mobile apps."" NSB also pointed out that companies operating in China are obligated to turn over user data under domestic laws for national security, public security, and intelligence purposes. So, using these apps can breach the privacy of users.The agency said that it evaluated Chinese apps against 15 indicators spanning five broad categories: Personal data collection, excessive permission usage, data transmission and sharing, system information extraction, and biometric data access.According to the analysis, RedNote violated all 15 indicators, followed by Weibo and TikTok that were found to breach 13 indicators. WeChat and Baidu Cloud violated 10 and 9 of the 15 indicators, respectively.These issues encompassed extensive collection of personal data, including facial recognition information, screenshots, clipboard contents, contact lists, and location information. All the apps have also been flagged for harvesting the list of installed apps and device parameters.""With regard to data transmission and sharing, the said five apps were found to send packets back to servers located in China,"" the NSB said. ""This type of transmission has raised serious concerns over the potential misuse of personal data by third-parties.""Taiwan's warning comes after several nations across the world have banned or restricted certain Chinese apps. In June 2020, India announced ban almost 100 Chinese-made apps, citing national security concerns. In November 2024, Canada ordered TikTok to dissolve its operations in the country.Last week, one of Germany's data protection authorities asked Apple and Google to remove Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot DeepSeek from their respective app stores. The Germany's data protection authourity accused DeepSeek of unlawful user data transfers to China.
