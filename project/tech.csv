Update on @suchirbalaji

We hired private investigator and did second autopsy to throw light on cause of death. Private autopsy doesn’t confirm cause of death stated by police.

Suchir’s apartment was ransacked , sign of struggle in the bathroom and looks like some one hit him in bathroom based on blood spots.

It’s a cold blooded mu*d*r declared by authorities as suicide.

Mother of Suchir Balaji , a 26-year-old researcher at OpenAI , is requesting help from Elon Musk following her son's death. Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment earlier this month. His mother posted on social media, tagging Musk and asking for an FBI investigation . Police stated, “no evidence of foul play was found during the initial investigation”. However, the San Francisco Chief Medical Examiner's Office determined Balaji's death a suicide. Balaji worked at OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT .In her post, Balaji’s mother - Poornima Rao expressed her worries and stated that “private autopsy doesn’t confirm cause of death stated by police.” She called for intervention from US authorities, stating that an FBI investigation is necessary to address the matter. Other than Elon Musk, she tagged American biotech entrepreneur and politician Vivek Ramaswamy and Gavin Newsom – Governor of California.The post has since gained attention, sparking a wave of responses on social media. It caught Musk’s attention as well who replied saying “This doesn’t seem like a suicide”.Suchir Balaji's mother further pleads saying “@elonmusk please support us”.In an interview with Business Insider last week, Rao revealed that Balaji had grown increasingly disillusioned with artificial intelligence (AI), particularly OpenAI’s shift toward commercialization with ChatGPT. She said, “He felt AI is a harm to humanity,” describing how her son, Suchir Balaji, transitioned from boundless optimism about AI’s potential to profound skepticism. Reflecting on his tragic death, she added, “It doesn’t look like a normal situation.”","Suchir Balaji, a 26-year-old researcher at OpenAI, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment earlier this month.

A winter wonderland to high seas glamour

Celebrity spotting in Aspen

Jeff Bezos' luxurious $500 million yacht, Koru, became the center of unexpected drama when customs officers conducted a surprise inspection near St. Barts on New Year's Eve. While the Amazon founder was notably absent, his fiancée, Lauren Sánchez, turned heads as she relaxed on deck, seemingly unfazed by the intrusion.Photos captured by Page Six showed Sánchez, clad in a chic Versace bikini and wide-brimmed hat, smiling for the cameras as uniformed customs officers scoured the vessel. The inspection lasted approximately three hours, with officers methodically combing through the yacht under the guidance of a stewardess.Sources confirmed the search was a routine procedure, though it briefly disrupted the yacht's otherwise opulent ambiance. Sánchez, however, kept her cool, mingling with friends, including her ex-boyfriend, former NFL star Tony Gonzalez . Gonzalez, who shares a 23-year-old son with Sánchez, even took a dip in the ocean as officers worked.Though the inspection created a momentary buzz, the mood aboard remained lighthearted. A stewardess was spotted briefing Sánchez on the situation, but the relaxed atmosphere suggested there was little cause for concern.The yacht inspection followed a whirlwind holiday season for Bezos and Sánchez. The couple had recently been in Aspen, Colorado, where their extravagant celebrations sparked rumors of a $600 million New Year’s Eve wedding. However, Bezos promptly debunked the speculation, calling it “completely false” in a post on X, formerly Twitter.“This whole thing is completely false — none of this is happening,” Bezos wrote. “The old adage ‘don’t believe everything you read’ is even more true today than ever. Lies can get ALL the way around the world before the truth can get its pants on.”Despite Bezos' denial, the Aspen festivities were anything but low-key. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner were spotted hand-in-hand leaving Matsuhisa, a renowned sushi hotspot tied to the wedding rumors. Meanwhile, Yellowstone star Kevin Costner mingled with guests, fresh off sharing drinks with Jennifer Lopez at a local bar.Whether on snowy slopes or sun-soaked decks, Bezos and Sánchez have managed to keep the spotlight firmly on them, proving that life as a billionaire couple is never dull—even when customs come knocking.","Jeff Bezos' $500 million yacht, Koru, was inspected by customs officers near St. Barts on New Year's Eve.

Pioneering career in Australian country music

Recognitions and legacy

Humorous performer loved by generations

Australian country music legend Chad Morgan, affectionately known as the “Sheik of Scrubby Creek,” has died at the age of 91. His son, Chad Junior, confirmed that Morgan passed away in a hospital in Gin Gin, Queensland, on New Year’s Day, as reported by ABC.Morgan, born in 1933 in Wondai, Queensland, was celebrated for his humorous country songs and unmistakable toothy grin. As per The Guardian, his signature smile even inspired Barry Humphries' creation of the character Sir Les Patterson.Morgan’s career began when he entered Australia’s Amateur Hour radio program in 1952, following a dare from his Royal Australian Air Force colleagues. This marked the beginning of a seven-decade-long career, with his first album released in 1952.According to news.com.au, Morgan's best-known songs included ‘The Sheik of Scrubby Creek ’, ‘I’m My Own Grandpa’, and ‘The Shotgun Wedding’. He also contributed a verse to Gordon Parsons ’ ‘A Pub with No Beer’, made famous by Slim Dusty.Morgan’s career brought him numerous accolades. He was inducted into the Tamworth Hands of Fame in 1979 and the Roll of Renown in 1987. In 2004, he received the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for his contributions to music.His lifetime achievements were further acknowledged with awards from the Country Music Association of Australia in 2010 and the Queensland Music Awards in 2018.In August 2024, a permanent exhibition, theChad Morgan Room , was inaugurated in Childers, Queensland, near Scrubby Creek, celebrating his enduring legacy.Morgan’s comedic genius and unique performance style earned him the title of “clown prince of comedy” from Slim Dusty.According to The Guardian, fellow country music star Troy Cassar-Daley remembered him as “so funny and whip-smart,” adding, “He always surprised me when he hit the stage at how many generations loved him”.Photographer John Elliot described him as ""larger than life"" and an original rockstar, saying Morgan was a trailblazer who drove through Australia’s rugged terrains to perform, long before modern conveniences like tour buses became popular.In early 2024, Morgan announced his retirement after more than 70 years of performing, which included venues ranging from small country festivals to the Sydney Opera House, where he famously played four encores. His life story inspired the documentary ‘I’m Not Dead Yet’, following false rumours of his death in 2008.","Chad Morgan, known as the ‘Sheik of Scrubby Creek,’ has died at the age of 91.

Polo flops and “box office poison” drama

Cookery show under pressure

The Sussex struggle: From Hollywood darlings to “colossal bombs”

Crisis control or end of the road?

It seems like the honeymoon phase between Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, and Netflix is officially over. Once hailed as the streaming platform’s dream duo, the Sussexes’ partnership with Netflix has hit a rough patch, with insiders whispering about mounting frustration and dwindling faith in their ability to deliver hits.The latest debacle? Their five-part documentary about polo, which critics have torched as a “tedious inside look” and a “dull indulgence.” One reviewer even joked it felt like a spoof designed to play in the background of Succession.As per the sources quoted by the Daily Mail, Netflix executives are “exhausted” from working with Markle. The fallout is apparently so bad that her upcoming cookery show—still without a premiere date—is being labeled as her “make or break” moment. “It’s so much work with her, and, bluntly, the ‘deliverable’ does not seem to be worth it,” one insider said.Adding fuel to the fire, there’s been zero buzz around the polo series. No press tours, no promotional events, no hype. Even Nacho Figueras, Harry’s polo pal and a star of the series, has barely mentioned it on social media. Hollywood veteran Sean McNulty told The Daily Beast: “The lack of a proper press campaign for a Harry and Meghan project is eyebrow-raising, to say the least.”According to reports, Meghan’s cookery show is now the Sussexes’ last hope at staying in Netflix’s good graces. One entertainment exec was quotes by the Daily Mail as saying, “Her show will have to be an enormous hit to turn around their deal and their reputations in this town.”The show is expected to drop in early 2024, coinciding with Harry’s appearance at the Winter Invictus Games in Canada and the launch of Meghan’s homeware brand, American Riviera Orchard . Talk about multitasking under pressure.Critics are having a field day with Harry and Meghan’s current reputation—or lack thereof. Marketing expert Tony Case didn’t mince words, was quoted by the Daily Beast as saying, “Harry and Meghan are box office poison. Everyone is running away from this colossal bomb.”He added, “They set out to conquer America, but no one here found them—or what they’re selling—to be particularly compelling.”Even their highly-publicized project Meet Me at the Lake, based on a best-selling novel, remains in limbo. With no production in sight, it’s unlikely to materialize before their Netflix deal is up for renewal next year.Friends who once hyped their projects are unusually quiet, fueling speculation that Hollywood may be losing patience with the couple. A source quoted in Closer Magazine tried to defend the Sussexes, blaming Netflix for pushing a “reality TV angle” that was out of their control.","The Sussexes’ partnership with Netflix has hit a rough patch, with insiders whispering about mounting frustration and dwindling faith in their ability to deliver hits. “It’s so much work with her, and, bluntly, the ‘deliverable’ does not seem to be worth it,” one insider said.

Explosion details and Musk’s statement

The Cybertruck’s robust build: How it contained the explosion

Ultra-hard 30X cold-rolled stainless steel Exoskeleton

Tesla armor glass

Angular design

Investigation underway

The fallout and looking ahead

A Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, killing one person and injuring several others. The explosion, which is currently under investigation as a potential terrorist attack, has left authorities and the public questioning the nature of the incident.However, Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to social media to offer a bold statement, claiming the attackers ""picked the wrong vehicle"" for their malicious intent. Musk explained how the design and features of the Cybertruck helped mitigate the severity of the blast, likely saving lives and preventing further destruction.The explosion occurred just hours after a bomb or large fireworks, possibly carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck, detonated outside the luxury hotel. Authorities have confirmed the blast is unrelated to the vehicle itself, but rather the explosive device placed in the truck's bed.Musk, in a tweet on X (formerly known as Twitter), commented, ""The evil knuckleheads picked the wrong vehicle for a terrorist attack. Cybertruck actually contained the explosion and directed the blast upwards. Not even the glass doors of the lobby were broken."" His words resonated as an unexpected defense of the vehicle’s design and strength, especially given the vehicle’s role as the target of the blast.While the blast itself resulted in fatalities, the Cybertruck’s engineering likely played a significant role in preventing further devastation. Photos from the scene show the vehicle's exterior relatively intact, with its tires remaining fully inflated, a rarity in explosions of this magnitude.The Cybertruck’s cutting-edge features might have helped absorb and redirect the explosion’s force:: The tough, durable exterior material is designed to withstand extreme conditions and impact forces. The stainless steel likely absorbed much of the blast's impact, preventing shrapnel from spreading and causing additional harm.: Known for its polymer-layered composite design, Tesla Armor Glass is built to absorb and redirect energy. While not entirely unbreakable, the glass likely prevented significant shattering from the blast, offering more protection to those in the vicinity.: The sharp, angular shape of the Cybertruck is not just for aesthetics—it’s engineered to deflect projectiles and debris. In this instance, it could have played a key role in directing the explosion's force upward, reducing potential damage to nearby structures and pedestrians.Law enforcement agencies are still piecing together the details of the explosion, which has been categorized as a possible act of terrorism. While the exact motives remain unclear, the significant role of the Tesla Cybertruck in containing the blast has drawn attention. ""We have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself,"" Musk clarified earlier.In the wake of this tragedy, the incident highlights the strength of the Cybertruck’s design in extreme circumstances. While the explosion caused significant loss, the vehicle's structural integrity appears to have prevented more extensive harm, sparking a new conversation about the safety potential of electric vehicles in hostile scenarios.While many are still grappling with the loss of life and the injuries sustained, the story of the Cybertruck’s performance is already sparking discussions about the future of vehicle safety. As investigators continue to examine the cause and nature of the attack, Musk’s comments have brought Tesla into the spotlight once again, raising questions about how new technologies could play a role in protecting people during catastrophic events.","A Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, killing one person and injuring several others.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

KASARAGOD: Two youths in Kerala 's Kasaragod district had a miraculous escape after their car, using Google Maps for navigation, drove into a swollen river and got stuck to a tree, allowing them to call for help. Their rescue by Fire Force personnel, captured on video, has since gone viral on social media.The incident occurred as the two were on their way to a hospital in Karnataka in the early hours. They were navigating with the help of Google Maps when they encountered the river on Pallanchi , which had overflowed due to heavy rains. Abdul Rasheed, one of the youths in the car, explained that Google Maps directed them onto a narrow road.""Using the vehicle's headlight, we felt that there was some water in front of us. But, we didn't see that there was a river on both sides and a bridge in the middle. There was also no sidewall for the bridge,"" Rasheed said.The car was swept away by the water currents but eventually got lodged in a tree on the riverbank. The youths managed to open the car door, exit the vehicle, and send their location to the Fire Force personnel. The rescue team arrived quickly and pulled both men to safety using ropes.""We never thought that we could come back to life. We truly feel that it is a rebirth,"" Rasheed added.Last month, a group of tourists from Hyderabad drove into a swollen stream near Kuruppanthara in Kottayam apparently after using Google Maps.All four managed to escape unharmed due to the efforts of a nearby police patrol unit and local residents, but their vehicle was completely submerged.","Two youths in Kerala had a miraculous escape after their car drove into a swollen river and got stuck to a tree.

The Utah-based company, known for its mobile accessories like screen protectors and phone cases, has an annual revenue of $600 million. ZAGG is currently notifying affected customers about the breach and advising them to take necessary precautions to protect their financial information. The data breach resulted in the theft of names, addresses, and payment card information of shoppers on zagg.com between October and November 2024.In a letter sent to affected customers (seen by Bleeping Computer), the company stated that the attacker compromised the FreshClicks app provided by BigCommerce and implanted malicious code to steal shoppers' card information.“We learned that an unknown actor injected into the FreshClick app malicious code that was designed to scrape credit card data entered as part of the checkout process for certain ZAGG.com customer transactions between October 26, 2024 and November 7, 2024,” Zagg wrote.ZAGG responded to the incident by implementing remediation measures, notifying federal authorities and regulators, and offering affected individuals 12 months of free credit monitoring via Experian. Affected customers have also been advised to monitor their financial accounts, place fraud alerts, and consider a credit freeze. However, the company has not disclosed the number of customers impacted.In a statement to BleepingComputer, BigCommerce said that its systems were neither breached nor compromised. The company identified the FreshClicks App hack using internal tools and subsequently removed the app from its customers' stores.“Using our internal tools and in communication with the partner, we verified the third-party FreshClicks App was compromised. Acting in the best interest of our customers and their shoppers, we immediately uninstalled the app in their stores, which removed any compromised APIs and malicious code,” BigCommerce noted.BigCommerce's store currently features six add-ons developed by FreshClick, with a total of 178 reviews.
