MVP Criticizes WWE for Not Utilizing Omos' Massive Potential,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/mvp-criticizes-wwe-for-not-utilizing-omos-massive-potential/articleshow/113267989.cms,"Also Read

MVP Criticizes WWE’s Mishandling of Omos and Lauds His Potential

Omos slams Braun Strowman with ease: WWE Crown Jewel (WWE Network Exclusive)

Also Read

When talking about WWE , Omos is a name that is on everyone’s lips. Standing tall at 7 feet 3 inches, Omos is a standout wrestler who has garnered widespread recognition for his strength, in-ring skills, and height. Not to mention, his accomplishments, imposing presence, and dynamic fight moves make him a remarkable figure in the industry.However, despite being a top-tier performer, fans and fellow wrestlers have expressed frustrations with WWE not leveraging his potential or giving them the adequate platform to shine.One of the individuals who have been vocal about this negligent attitude towards the Nigerian wrestler is MVP. Let’s shine some light on what he has to say.Back in April 2022, the company decided to team Omos up with MVP after the latter’s split from Bobby Lashley who he guided and trained to Championship. The former WWE boss, Vince McMahon decided this pairing to replicate the success MVP had with Lashley. Since this partnership, Omos’ appearance on the ring became irregular and the last time he was seen on stage was during his epic showdown with Brock Lesner at WrestleMania 39.During a K&S WrestleFest Virtual Signing, MVP expressed his frustrations over what he calls WWE and McMahon’s mishandling of Omos. He also praised Omos for his dedication, hard work, and willingness to improve, saying,“When Vince called me and Bobby in the office, he said, ‘Hey guys, I want to split you guys up. Bobby, I want you to be a standalone star now. MVP, I want to put you with Omos. I want you to do for Omos what you did for Bobby.’ Those were Vince’s words. ‘Okay.’ I’m not happy about this, but I look forward to the task. Omos has such a huge heart. Literally and figuratively. He really wants to learn, wants to get better. He was an open book. Coachable. We weren’t on TV a lot, but we were on all the live events. I got to watch him week in and week out improve and get better.”MVP also shared his conversation with Triple H about Omos. The wrestling legend and WWE Chief Content Manager, according to MVP had a specific vision for Omos. He wanted the latter to be an occasional attraction rather than a weekly TV presence. He voiced his concerns regarding WWE’s handling of Omos or rather, to put it bluntly, the promotions’ failure to capitalize on his potential, saying,“I don’t know what his status is now. I don’t know what they plan on doing with him, but if you can’t take a legitimate 7-foot 3-inch, 385 pounds….if you can’t make money with a 7-foot 3-inch, 385-pound former basketball player that can move. You don’t see him move a lot because they don’t want him to. When he wants to move, you’d be surprised how well that big man can move. If you can’t make money with that then you’re just an idiot.”In short, Omos’ future remains uncertain. While he has showcased great expertise and skills, the talented Nigerian wrestler hasn’t been in action since his appearance in Andre The Giant Memorial Battle on SmackDown before WrestleMania XL. This has fans wondering when he will make a comeback and what role WWE will have for him.","Nigerian wrestler Omos is a standout wrestler who has garnered widespread recognition for his strength, in-ring skills, and height.

"Meghan Markle’s autobiography could be a ‘gold mine,’ says royal expert",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/meghan-markles-autobiography-could-be-a-gold-mine-says-royal-expert/articleshow/113218296.cms,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle might be preparing to capitalize on their strained relationship with the British monarchy, with reports suggesting Meghan’s potential autobiography could be a “gold mine.” Royal expert Tom Bower has highlighted the lucrative possibilities of such a book, predicting it could significantly boost their income.Bower, speaking to Talk TV , said, “The only thing she has got left - and I think that is her potential gold mine - is her autobiography.She has a very vivid imagination and she’ll be able to spell out an amazing story... to increase her income.”The couple is reportedly biding their time before discussing their royal experiences more openly, opting instead to hold off on immediate media actions. The release of Meghan’s book could further inflame tensions between the Sussexes and the Royal Family , particularly following the mixed reception of Harry's memoir, Spare.Bower also criticized Meghan’s acting career, remarking, “The problem is, she isn’t a great actress. Her acting career ended long before she arrived in London - that’s why she came here. She couldn’t find any more work after Suits.”Speculation about Meghan’s autobiography has been circulating since Harry’s book gained attention in early 2023. Some publishing experts believe it is strategic for the couple to delay further releases, as maintaining public interest is crucial. An insider noted, “Fans are fickle. Disappoint them once, and a book can freefall into irrelevance super quickly, even with the momentum of something like Spare behind it. Their team, who are good at what they do, wants to make the angry mobs salivate for it before throwing Meghan’s story to the masses because even the bad press is good press for this couple.”","Royal expert Tom Bower has highlighted the lucrative possibilities of such a book, predicting it could significantly boost their income.

Hobby apps over dating apps? Why fitness and reading platforms are the new matchmakers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/hobby-apps-over-dating-apps-why-fitness-and-reading-platforms-are-the-new-matchmakers/articleshow/113214577.cms,"Strava sees significant growth

Hobby platforms turned social networks

Why the shift?

The changing landscape of social apps

Dating apps like Tinder and Bumble are no longer the go-to platforms for singles seeking love. Instead, people are now turning to Goodreads and Strava , apps initially designed for running, reading, and other hobbies, to find their perfect match.Strava, the popular fitness app known for tracking running and cycling activities, has experienced a substantial 20% increase in user numbers over the past year, according to Sensor Tower and reported by The Guardian.This surge in users has prompted Strava to introduce a new messaging feature, allowing users to connect while tracking their fitness goals.Other hobby-based apps are also seeing a boost in users. Ravelry, a social network for knitting enthusiasts, now boasts a user base of over 9 million. Goodreads, the platform for book lovers, has accumulated more than 150 million members. Meanwhile, Letterboxd , an app for movie enthusiasts, has seen its user base explode from 1.8 million in March 2020 to over 14 million this summer. The app’s impressive 55% growth in monthly active users highlights the increasing popularity of these niche social networks.Dr Carolina Are, a social media researcher at the Centre for Digital Citizens at Northumbria University, explains that these hobby-based apps allow users to connect through shared interests, creating a more engaging and less contentious environment. This focus on common passions reduces the need for stringent content moderation and enhances the overall user experience.Letterboxd’s editor-in-chief, Gemma Gracewood, adds that the app’s design, which includes in-line comments and a community-focused approach, discourages public shaming and amplifies the positive interactions among users. Similarly, Goodreads and Strava offer messaging features that foster connections without the risk of public shaming prevalent on other platforms.As users increasingly migrate from traditional social networks and dating apps, new platforms are emerging as havens for genuine connections. With many abandoning Elon Musk’s social network due to controversies over free speech, apps like Bluesky and Threads are seeing a resurgence, while hobby-based platforms continue to thrive.Are suggests that the lower expectations and less sexually charged atmosphere on these hobby apps create a more relaxed environment for users seeking meaningful connections. Unlike traditional dating apps, which can often feel like a “dating supermarket,” these platforms offer a refreshing alternative for those looking to find love through shared interests.","Strava, the popular fitness app known for tracking running and cycling activities, has experienced a substantial 20% increase in user numbers over the past year.

Social Media Outrage: Elon Musk’s offer to give child to Taylor Swift sparks outrage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musks-offer-to-give-child-to-taylor-swift-sparks-outrage-how-low-can-one-go/articleshow/113254335.cms,"In a display that has left many social media users questioning the depths of public discourse, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made headlines on Tuesday with an unsolicited and highly peculiar offer to pop star Taylor Swift . This came in the wake of Swift’s endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris for the presidency.Swift's endorsement, accompanied by the cheeky sign-off “Taylor Swift, Childless Cat Lady,” was seen as a pointed critique of former President Donald Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, and his focus on family values.Musk’s reaction to this political jab was not only unexpected but has sparked widespread disbelief. In a tweet that has since gone viral, Musk wrote, “Fine Taylor … you win … I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life.”To many on social media, Musk’s proposal seems like a disturbing low point in public discourse. The reaction has been swift and severe.With over 1.3 million views, Musk’s tweet has prompted a flurry of responses ranging from confusion to outright horror. “Am I reading this right that you are offering to have a child with Taylor Swift?” asked one bewildered user. Another simply expressed, “My God.”For many, Musk's comment represents a new nadir in how public figures interact on social media. The sentiment was echoed by Swift’s supporters, who branded the offer as “creepy” and “weird.” “Taylor wants precisely zero to do with you,” one fan bluntly stated, capturing the general consensus that Musk's approach was not only out of touch but also inappropriate.Swift’s endorsement of Harris was rooted in a genuine political statement, praising Harris as a “steady-handed, gifted leader” and highlighting her selection of running mate Tim Walz as a positive step for LGBTQ+ rights and women’s autonomy. Swift’s message, paired with a personal photo of her with her cat, emphasized her commitment to these causes.In contrast, Musk’s response has been viewed as a troubling and bizarre attempt to overshadow Swift’s political endorsement with a personal and unsolicited offer. As the 2024 election cycle continues to unfold, Musk’s actions add a new layer of controversy and reflect a broader trend of increasingly bizarre and inflammatory statements in public discourse.","Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made headlines on Tuesday with an unsolicited and highly peculiar offer to pop star Taylor Swift.

First, you need to log in to the e-filing ITR portal, then go to the 'Pending Actions' tab to access the compliance portal.CBDT stated in its press release that the Annual Information Statement is accessible to all registered Income Taxpayers via the compliance portal, which can be reached through the e-filing website (incometax.gov.in).According to the CBDT's press release, if the feedback is partially or fully accepted, the source needs to correct the information by filing a correction statement.The AIS will display the following details regarding feedback confirmation from the source:- Confirmation Status: Indicates if feedback has been shared with the reporting source.- Date of Feedback Sharing: Shows when feedback was sent to the reporting source.- Date of Source Response: Displays when the reporting source responded to the feedback.- Source Response: Indicates the response provided by the source based on the taxpayer's feedback (whether correction is needed or not).CBDT mentioned in the press release that this new feature is anticipated to enhance transparency by showing such information in AIS to the taxpayer.If there's incorrect AIS data, you need to give feedback for correction. But in the past, there have been issues when the reporting source didn't act promptly to fix this. As a result, taxpayers got income tax intimation notices because of discrepancies between AIS and ITR data.Mihir Tanna, an associate director-direct tax at S.K Patodia LLP, a CA firm, states that they have observed how incorrect information in AIS has caused distress to numerous legitimate taxpayers upon receiving intimation from the income tax department regarding data mismatches between AIS and filed ITR. In the past, some of their clients encountered issues where sale and purchase transactions of shares appeared in AIS, despite not being conducted by them. They provided feedback in the AIS tab but were uncertain if the reporting entity took necessary action.This new feature will make it clear if you need to do anything more after providing feedback on wrong AIS information. According to Tanna, if the reporting source doesn't accept the feedback, then the taxpayer only needs to take necessary action. This clarity and transparency are provided by the new functionality.Experts note that the CBDT's press release doesn't specify how the taxpayer will be informed about the feedback provided by the reporting source.Divya Jokhakar, a CA and Associate of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) in the United Kingdom (UK), explains that the new feature will now notify the taxpayer after they provide feedback on incorrect AIS data, including the date when the reporting source is informed and confirmation is sent. Similarly, the taxpayer will also be notified about the response and its date from the source. The press release doesn't mention how this communication will happen, but it's likely to be through SMS to the registered mobile number and email to the registered email ID.Experts also mention that the communication between the taxpayer and reporting source becomes simpler. According to Jokhakar, this change means that communication is no longer one-sided as it was before. This should provide taxpayers with some relief, knowing that their feedback is being addressed. Additionally, they can interact with sources like tax deductors , collectors, and SFT filers more easily.The AIS gathers financial data from various sources known as reporting entities. This data offers a snapshot of the taxpayer's financial transactions, forming the basis for filing income tax returns. Yet, since this information comes from third-party reports, there's a possibility of errors entering the AIS database due to reporting mistakes.To address this issue, CBDT implemented a feedback system within AIS.CBDT stated in the press release that within AIS, taxpayers can now give feedback on each displayed transaction. This feedback allows taxpayers to comment on the accuracy of the information provided by the source. If there's incorrect reporting, the system automatically follows up with the source for confirmation. Currently, this confirmation process is operational for information provided by Tax Deductors/Collectors and Reporting Entities.With the recent update, the feedback system has become more responsive, giving taxpayers the ability to take corrective actions and track the status of correction requests.","The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has revamped the AIS system, enabling individuals to track the status of their correction requests in real-time. This feature will show if the taxpayer's feedback has been addressed by the source, either partially or fully, by accepting or rejecting it.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110152827,imgsize-27984,width-400,resizemode-4/110152827.jpg"

Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram , has recently become the subject of widespread speculation after older photos of him resurfaced online. These images have led many to wonder whether the billionaire entrepreneur underwent plastic surgery to enhance his appearance. Adding to the intrigue, Durov was recently arrested in France, raising further questions about the man behind the popular messaging app.Pavel Durov, a 39-year-old entrepreneur originally from Russia, is best known as the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.Telegram quickly gained popularity for its strong emphasis on user privacy, offering end-to-end encryption and other security features that set it apart from competitors. As of now, Forbes estimates Durov's net worth to be around $15.5 billion. Despite his success in the tech industry, Durov has managed to maintain a relatively low profile—until now.Durov's recent arrest in Paris has added a new layer of complexity to his public image. He was detained in France on charges of suspected complicity in running an online platform involved in illicit activities, including child exploitation, drug trafficking, and fraud. While these allegations are serious, it is the sudden focus on Durov's physical transformation that has captured the internet's attention.Pavel Durov has been active on social media platforms like Instagram since 2011, regularly sharing photos from his travels around the world. In his recent posts, Durov appears with a full head of hair and a toned physique, often posing shirtless in various locations. However, these recent images stand in stark contrast to older photos where Durov was seen with a noticeably receding hairline.The drastic change in his appearance has fueled rumours that Durov may have undergone plastic surgery, including a possible hair transplant. A popular post on X (formerly Twitter) by a well-known account shared a side-by-side comparison of Durov's old and new photos, sparking a flurry of online discussions. The post reads, ""Pavel Durov (Telegram CEO) before his hair transplant and plastic surgery,"" and has since gone viral.The speculation around Durov's transformation has been met with a variety of opinions online. On Reddit, users have debated whether the changes in Durov's appearance are the result of surgical procedures or simply better grooming and styling.One Reddit user commented, ""This isn't a hair transplant. His hair is too thick and full to have this kind of drastic change from a HT. Most likely he's wearing a hair system (wig).""Another user added, ""There's speculation that it's not a transplant, but rather a hair system because his hair loss was much more advanced in the first picture, so when the operation happens, the resulting hairdo never looks as full as his.""Some users believe the changes are the result of plastic surgery, with one theorising, ""This is well-done surgery.""However, not everyone is convinced that surgery is involved. One Reddit user opined, ""Honestly, I think a lot of the facial 'changes' are simply due to the much better angle and lighting in the second photo.""As the speculation continues, it's clear that Durov's transformation—whether natural or assisted—has caught the public's eye. The intense scrutiny of his appearance highlights the challenges that come with being in the spotlight, especially for someone as private as Durov. Whether or not he has undergone any procedures, the discussions around his looks reflect a broader societal fascination with image and success.","Pavel Durov, 39, is the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.
