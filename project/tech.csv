In the debut episode of her new podcast The Pre-Game, Kayla reflected on how dating high-profile men led to toxic dynamics and emotional pain, ultimately pushing her to change how she approaches love and relationships.Kayle Nicole admitted that the experience of dating someone in the public eye came with a price constant scrutiny, unsolicited opinions, and being dragged into media storms she never asked for. After her split from Kelce in 2022, the situation escalated when Travis Kelce began dating Taylor Swift. The online harassment Kayla faced intensified, with people comparing her to Swift, questioning her worth, and making cruel comments. She confessed that this hate still affects her to this day, despite having done nothing to deserve it.Kayla Nicole, who once interned at TMZ and the Oprah Winfrey Network before launching her own media brand, is now opening up on her podcast The Pre-Game about the struggles behind her success.

It was a painful chapter that shaped her resilience and drive.""It's not that simple. It's not going to happen,"" she explained.Kayla Nicole shared that these experiences left her feeling broken and deeply self-conscious, saying she spent a long time trying to heal. She was often forced to explain herself or stay silent while the world judged her unfairly. It made her realize that even though her past relationships brought temporary highs, the emotional toll was far too great.In a heartfelt moment, Kayla Nicole said, ""I’ve been harshly treated by more than one man. Travis wasn’t only one. But the aftermath of that relationship taught me to put myself first.""Now, she’s taking a different path, one that prioritizes privacy, peace, and emotional safety. Kayla Nicole stated she’s no longer interested in making her romantic life public, joking that she's now “dating and hiding.” She won’t reveal who she’s with unless she’s married and has a family. For Kayla, this boundary isn't about secrecy, it's about protection.Kayla Nicole's story is resonating with many who’ve faced similar situations, and she’s using her voice to advocate for healing, setting boundaries, and choosing self-love over public validations.Also Read: Kayla Nicole and the ‘gold digger’ myth: Debunking outdated stereotypes about women dating athletes","Kayla Nicole has been candid about her emotional journey post-breakup with Travis Kelce.

Users also request the bot to add personal touches, like coffee mugs or pets, reflecting items from their daily lives. The outcome is a strikingly realistic custom Barbie doll that seems ready for purchase.Choose a clear, well-lit image of yourself, a friend, or even a pet you want to transform.Use ChatGPT to refine promptsTools like DALL·E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion to create the final image.Select a high-quality photo with good lighting and a visible subject (face or full body works best). The clearer the image, the easier it is for AI tools to interpret details. If you’re uploading the photo to an AI tool, ensure it’s in a common format like JPEG or PNG.ChatGPT can help you write detailed, specific prompts for image generators. Describe your goal: Turning your photo into a Barbie-style doll. Here’s how to interact with ChatGPT:Example Input to ChatGPT: “I want to turn a photo of a person into a Barbie-style doll using an AI image generator. Can you help me create a detailed prompt that captures the Barbie aesthetic—glossy hair, vibrant outfits, and a plastic-like doll finish?”Below are some ready-to-use prompts optimized for AI image generators. Adjust them based on your photo’s subject (e.g., swap “woman” for “man” or “pet” if needed).“A hyper-realistic Barbie doll based on a [describe subject, e.g., young woman with long brown hair], with smooth, glossy skin, large sparkling eyes, and a bright smile. She wears a vibrant pink ball gown with glittery accents, high heels, and a tiara. Her hair is styled in voluminous waves, with a plastic-like sheen. The background is a dreamy pastel pink studio with soft lighting, giving a toy-box aesthetic. Ultra-detailed, 4K resolution.”“A Barbie-style doll version of [describe subject, e.g., a person with short blonde hair], with flawless, porcelain-like skin and bold makeup (pink lipstick, dramatic eyelashes). Dressed in a trendy, colorful jumpsuit with statement jewelry and stiletto boots. The pose is confident, hands on hips, with a glossy, plastic-like texture. Set against a chic city skyline backdrop at sunset, vibrant and polished, cinematic lighting, 8K quality.”“A magical Barbie doll inspired by [describe subject, e.g., a woman with curly red hair], with an ethereal glow, sparkling blue eyes, and a doll-like finish. She wears a flowing, iridescent mermaid-style dress with gemstone details and a crown. Her hair cascades in shiny, toy-like curls. The background is a whimsical fantasy forest with glowing flowers, rendered in a vibrant, hyper-detailed style, 4K resolution.”“A cute Barbie-style doll version of [describe pet, e.g., a fluffy white dog], transformed into an anthropomorphic toy with big, shiny eyes and a plastic-like sheen. Dressed in a tiny pink tutu and bow, with a sparkly collar. The pose is playful, standing upright like a doll. Background is a colorful toy store shelf with pastel props, ultra-realistic, 4K quality.”Pro Tip: Add “inspired by a photo of [subject]” to the prompt if the AI tool allows photo uploads for reference. For example, “A Barbie doll inspired by a photo of a woman with long black hair…”Sign into your chosen AI image tool (e.g., Midjourney via Discord, Stable Diffusion’s web interface, or DALL·E through OpenAI’s platform). Follow these steps:Some tools allow you to upload a reference image. Check the tool’s guidelines for how to integrate it.Copy your ChatGPT-crafted or provided prompt into the text field.Set the resolution to high (e.g., 4K or 8K if available) and choose a style like “hyper-realistic” or “cinematic” for that polished Barbie look.Run the prompt and wait for the output. It may take a few seconds to minutes.For extra polish, you can use editing software to enhance your Barbie doll images. Apply a slight blur or airbrush effect for that plastic-doll finish. You can use Canva or Photoshop to add glittery effects to outfits or backgrounds.","ChatGPT can help you write detailed, specific prompts for image generators.

Guide on obtaining Coca Leaves in Schedule 1

How to Make/cook Cocaine in Schedule 1 Game - How to use Cauldron

Unlocking Salvador Moreno

Purchasing Coca Seeds and cultivating into Coca Leaves

Harvesting and processing Coca Leaves

In Schedule 1 , you have to cultivate, produce, and deal different drugs to expand your empire. When it comes to cocaine production, you will need to get Coca Leaves, which can be cultivated from Coca Seeds.However, these seeds aren’t readily available, and are a premium commodity. You will first have to unlock the exclusive dealer named Salvador Moreno, and then order these seeds from him. The guide below will walk you through the process of acquiring Coca Seeds, cultivating them into Coca Leaves, and processing them.To get started, you need to unlock Salvador Moreno, who is the exclusive supplier of Coca Seeds. The supplier operates from the Docks area, and you will have to reach the Enforcer I rank to unlock the same. To achieve the particular rank, you must expand your empire and successfully manage your operations in the other regions.After Docks is open for you, the next thing to do is establish connections with either Javier Perez or Mac Cooper. They will introduce you to Salvador Moreno, and you may then arrange the purchase of Coca Seeds in Schedule 1.As already stated, Coca Seeds are a premium commodity in Schedule 1, and you will have to pay the big bucks to acquire them. If you are ordering them through a dead drop, each seed will cost you $80, and there will be a purchase limit of $2,000 or 10 seeds per transaction. Alternatively, in-person purchases will require you to spend $150 per seed. These seeds will be a significant investment, so you must plan your finances correctly.Once you have got your hands on Coca Seeds, you must start with the cultivation. Planting them follows the same procedure as other seeds that you generally acquire from Albert. All you have to do is set up a grow tent or pot with soil, remove the seed cap, and plant the seed.If you've hired a Botanist in Schedule 1, the process becomes even easier. You must simply put the Coca Seed on an appropriate rack and assign the supplies. The Botanist will take up the entire growth process and would ensure optimal yield.You'll finally have mature Coca Leaves ready for harvest. After harvesting, you can transform these leaves into a sellable product by processing them in a Cauldron. The particular equipment is available upon reaching Enforcer I, and you can purchase it from Oscar for $3,000.Upon setting up the Cauldron, you can begin processing the Coca Leaves, with the standard recipe requiring 20 Coca Leaves and 1 unit of Gasoline. For a higher-quality output, you can also consider drying the Coca Leaves on a drying rack.Additionally, to completely streamline the production, you can consider hiring staff. A fully automated production for the particular drug requires you to have one Botanist, three Handlers, and four Chemists.","In Schedule 1, you have to cultivate, produce, and deal different drugs to expand your empire.

Over the last day, several users who are facing this issue took to Reddit, Google support pages, and Roku forums to highlight the widespread nature of this issue.

The moderator has asked users to check for Roku OS updates if their YouTube TV app has disappeared.Several affected users also noted that updating to a newer OS version restores the YouTube TV app. However, as the exact cause remains unclear, this fix suggests that the issue may lie with Roku. It can be possibly related to how the Roku store functions on older OS versions, the report noted.One users took to Reddit to noted: “The app icon disappeared from my list of apps, and I'm unable to add it back in to my list. Reset the TV already, will stream from phone onto TV until fixed.”“I wanted to watch YouTube TV on our Roku TV , but when I looked for it, it had suddenly disappeared. When I searched for it through the app search function, it was still there, but I could not open it. When I restarted it came back for a second but then disappeared again. Does anyone know why this is? This is our most used streaming platform, so we really need to know,” another Reddit user highlighted.Meanwhile, a third user wrote: “Weirdest thing, the app is no longer on the Home Screen , go to add the app and put in the password, and it says that it can’t be added at this time.

After a series of delays earlier in the week, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket finally lifted off from Kennedy Space Center ’s Pad 39A at 8:53 pm on Saturday. The rocket was carrying 21 starlink satellites into orbit, with 13 of them equipped with direct to cell capabilities, which is designed to enhance mobile connectivity.While there was no official explanation for the delay, the liftoff was a thrilling sight for many viewers. Depending on their location, spectators watched as the rocket flew either over, under, or right in front of the full moon, which was visible in the eastern sky. It was a spectacular display for those in the Space Coast area, Florida.This particular launch marked the 10th flight for the Falcon 9's first-stage booster, which had already seen action in several previous missions, including four starlink missions, Nasa Crew-8, and others, reported Florida Today.Despite some expecting sonic booms in central Florida, the booster successfully landed on the drone ship ""A Shortfall of Gravitas"" about eight-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, as it made its way back to the Atlantic Ocean.Looking ahead, SpaceX is preparing for another launch from Cape Canaveral on Sunday, April 13, for another batch of Starlink satellites.","SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Kennedy Space Center at 8:53 pm.

What directives did the FAA issue for the model?



What did New York Helicopter Tour CEO say?



The Hudson River helicopter tragedy points to the mismanagement of the private company New York Helicopter Tour as reports have now revealed that the helicopter reported a mechanical issue months before. Siemens executive Agustin Escobar , his wife and three children were killed when the helicopter broke midair and nosedived into the murky water of the Hudson river minutes after flying.The ill-fated Bell206L-4 LongRanger IV aircraft, owned and operated by New York Helicopter, experienced a mechanical issue with its transmission assembly last September, according to Federal Aviation Administration data. Records show the doomed chopper was built in 2004 and had already logged 12,728 hours of flight time when it was forced into repair.The Big Apple company has come on the radar after this recent tragedy, as this is not the first one involving the company. The pilot's experience and the wreckage of the helicopter are also under scrutiny. Investigators will also review the maintenance work that was done on the doomed aircraft, including the completion of two recent safety airworthiness directives the FAA issued on Bell 206L model helicopters.The federal agency issued the first directive in December 2022 and called for the inspection and possible replacement of the models’ main rotor blades due to “delamination” — an issue with the internal layers of the blade separating due to material fatigue, damage or other defects, the New York Post reported.A second directive, issued in May 2023, required the testing and possible replacement of tail rotor shafts on eight models, including the one involved in Thursday’s deadly wreck, according to the FAA, which issued the alert after a chopper lost a tail-rotor drive due to a joint failure.In 2013, a Bell 206 chopper carrying four Swedish tourists crash-landed in the Hudson, though the pilot and the other passengers miraculously survived. At that time the company CEO Michael Roth said he had no clue what happened. After Thursday's tragedy again, Roth said he did not know what happened. “The only thing I know by watching a video of the helicopter falling down, that the main rotor blades weren’t on the helicopter. And I haven’t seen anything like that in my 30 years being in business, in the helicopter business,” he said.","The ill-fated Bell206L-4 LongRanger IV aircraft, owned and operated by New York Helicopter, experienced a mechanical issue with its transmission assembly last September.

"Doctors said he’d never move again, then Elon Musk’s brain chip changed everything",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/doctors-said-hed-never-move-again-then-elon-musks-brain-chip-changed-everything/articleshow/120236834.cms,"Noland Arbaugh (Picture credit: X)

A groundbreaking moment in neurotechnology has taken centre stage in the life of Noland Arbaugh , a 30-year-old man from Arizona, US, who became the first person to receive a brain chip implant from Elon Musk ’s Neuralink .Arbaugh, who was paralysed below the shoulders following a diving accident in 2016, received the chip in January 2024 and the results have already been nothing short of extraordinary, reported BBC.The device, a brain-computer interface (BCI), enables Arbaugh to control a computer using only his thoughts. “You just have no control, no privacy, and it's hard,” he said, recalling his early struggles with paralysis. But after the surgery, he could move a computer cursor by merely thinking about moving his fingers. “Honestly I didn’t know what to expect, it sounds so sci-fi,” BBC quoted him.Now, he can play video games and even beat his friends at chess, a feat he never imagined after his injury. “Now I'm beating my friends at games, which really shouldn't be possible, but it is”.While not the first BCI ever developed, Neuralink’s chip has attracted significant attention due to Musk’s involvement. Still, Arbaugh insists the focus should be on the science, not the celebrity. “If everything worked out, then I could help being a participant of Neuralink. If something terrible happened, I knew they would learn from it,” he said.The chip works by detecting brain signals linked to movement and translating them into digital commands. It’s part of a field that has developed over decades, but Musk’s entrance has brought heightened attention and scrutiny. Experts have hailed the procedure as a “significant milestone,” though caution remains due to the chip’s invasive nature.There have been challenges. Arbaugh temporarily lost control of the device when it partially disconnected from his brain, causing significant distress. The issue was later resolved through software adjustments.Privacy concerns also loom large. Professor Anil Seth from the University of Sussex warned that such technology could grant access to “what we think, what we believe and what we feel,” suggesting it could mark the end of personal privacy. But Arbaugh remains optimistic, hoping to one day use the chip to control a wheelchair or even a robot.Neuralink isn’t alone in this space. Competitor Synchron, for example, uses a less invasive method by implanting its device through a blood vessel. One user, identified only as Mark, can now explore the world virtually using the chip in combination with Apple’s Vision Pro headset.For Arbaugh, who joined a six-year study for the Neuralink device, the future is uncertain but full of possibility. “We know so little about the brain and this is allowing us to learn so much more,” he said.Whether for restoring movement, enabling communication, or even transforming how humans interact with machines, Arbaugh’s experience may represent only the beginning of a revolution.","Noland Arbaugh, 30, was paralysed below the shoulders following a diving accident in 2016.

Europeans Need Permit To Enter Uk, Trumps Reciprocal Tariffs Begin April 2

UK has introduced a new online entry requirements for European visitors from Wednesday, implementing a digital Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) permit as part of enhanced security measures.European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9. The system has already been operational for visitors from America, Canada and other visa-exempt nations since Britain's EU departure in 2020.UK border force chief Phil Douglas confirmed this implementation as part of a broader global rollout, emphasising its primary function as a security measure.The system aims to expedite entry procedures whilst enabling background checks on immigration history and criminal records. Douglas highlighted that approved travellers would benefit from faster border crossing through eGates.""The quid pro quo for the individual, though, is that we are building a contactless border, so if they're cleared for entry, they'll be able to use our new eGates and they'll be able to go through the border much more quickly,"" he added.During the initial buffer period, expected to continue until ""September or October,"" travellers can still proceed with their journeys. The ETA remains valid for two years, permitting stays up to six months.Applications opened to Europeans in March, covering approximately 30 countries, excluding Ireland. Applicants must submit passport photos and facial images through a smartphone app or government website, typically taking 10 minutes to complete.Whilst most applications receive swift responses, authorities advise allowing three working days. The requirement extends to all ages, though transit passengers not crossing UK borders are exempt following Heathrow Airport's concerns about European connection traffic.Heathrow, which handled 84 million passengers in 2024 with one-third from the EU, initially launched the scheme for Qatar in 2023 before expanding to Gulf nations. By January, it included about 50 additional countries including Argentina, South Korea and New Zealand.","European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Bill Gates reveals the one trait that could’ve made him a better manager,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-reveals-the-one-trait-that-couldve-made-him-abettermanager/articleshow/120214749.cms,"Bill Gates reveals the one trait that could’ve made him a better manager

Why Bill Gates thinks his old leadership style held Microsoft back

“I think if you want to work hard and not fool yourself, you better be pretty hard on yourself,”

“We were a fairly homogeneous, very engineering-orientated group,”

Bill Gates admits: ‘If you can’t do math, you can’t do anything’ was a mistake

“I sort of thought, if you can do math, you can do anything. And if you can’t do math, you can’t do anything,”

The turning point: From tech titan to global collaborator

“I was able to take mistakes I'd made, and learnings from Microsoft, and bring that to the foundation,”

Why Bill Gates says great managers adapt, not demand

“The one change that could’ve made me a better manager earlier?”

“Recognizing that talent isn’t one-size-fits-all.”

Bill Gates finds joy in learning, even after changing the world

“It is a lot of fun,” Gates said. “I get to work with smart people. I'm learning all the time. I get to travel the world.”

In a rare and candid conversation on the ""People by WTF"" podcast, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates offered a revealing account of his evolution as a leader—from the intense early years at Microsoft to his more collaborative role in global philanthropy today. Speaking with host Nikhil Kamath, Gates unpacked how his high standards and exacting personal discipline once hindered his ability to manage others effectively.His reflections shed light on the challenges of leadership in the fast-paced world of tech and the importance of adaptability, empathy, and recognizing diverse forms of talent. As Gates shared, becoming a good manager was a process of trial, error, and deep self-examination—lessons he would later apply with greater impact at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.During the formative years of Microsoft, Gates admitted that his leadership approach mirrored the way he treated himself—relentlessly high-pressure and narrowly focused on intellectual excellence.Gates explained, acknowledging how this mindset translated into his management approach.His internal expectations, based on a rigorous work ethic and technical prowess, created a performance culture that favored those who shared his engineering mindset. However, this style proved limiting.Gates said.This homogeneity, he acknowledged, led to missed opportunities to recruit and retain talented individuals who didn't fit the mold but could have brought valuable perspectives.Gates described how he once held a binary view of talent—believing that proficiency in mathematics was the primary indicator of potential.he confessed.This reductive thinking shaped Microsoft’s early culture, where analytical prowess often overshadowed other skills like communication, leadership, and cross-functional collaboration. Gates now views this assumption as a significant blind spot in his early career.The transformation in Gates’ management philosophy accelerated after he transitioned to full-time work at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Unlike in the tech sector, the foundation required broad, multidisciplinary collaboration—working with policymakers, health experts, educators, and community leaders.he said.At the foundation, success depended not just on IQ or coding skills but on empathy, negotiation, and cultural awareness—qualities that had been undervalued in Microsoft’s early days.One of Gates’ most important takeaways was the realization that intelligence and capability come in many forms. Leadership, he learned, requires more than managing deliverables—it requires recognizing the diverse strengths of team members and adapting one’s style accordingly.Gates reflected.This lesson became central to his work in philanthropy, where success is rarely achieved in isolation and often depends on partnerships across sectors and continents.Today, Gates continues to apply his trademark discipline, but without the rigidity that once characterized his leadership. He remains deeply involved in global initiatives and thrives in environments where learning and collaboration are prioritized.Despite decades of success, Gates emphasised that he is still learning—and still evolving.","Bill Gates reveals the one trait that could’ve made him a better manager.

What is Formula E?

Who founded Formula E

All eyes are currently on Formula 1 , as the season kicked off last month in Australia. However, there's another motorsport series that deserves just as much attention—one that not only thrills but is also in tune with the global movement for sustainability. Enter Formula E, the FIA-recognized single-seater world championship. Like Formula 1, it showcases high-speed racing, but with a key distinction: it’s environmentally conscious. Formula E uses all-electric cars, offering a cleaner, greener alternative to traditional motorsports while also driving innovation in the electric vehicle sector.Formula E cars are smaller, lighter, and require far fewer tire changes over the course of the season, which helps minimize their environmental footprint. And if you’re wondering whether these electric racers can deliver the same level of excitement as Formula 1, consider this: the Generation 3 Formula E car can reach speeds exceeding 100 km/h, proving that sustainability and speed can indeed go hand in hand.The ABB FIA Formula E Championship is currently in its 11th season, with the next race—the Miami ePrix—set for April 12. The season will run until July 27, with many more thrilling races scheduled across the globe.Formula 1 has been around since 1950 and has only evolved into hybrid vehicles relying on fossil fuels like E10 fuel (a mix of 90% petrol and 10% renewable ethanol). In contrast, Formula E is the motorsport of the 21st century after coming into existence in 2014. These races feature all-electric cars that run on powertrains converting energy from a battery into motion.One of the most striking differences between the two sports is how the cars handle tire changes. In Formula 1, teams often swap tires multiple times during a single race due to varying track conditions. In Formula E, however, teams are only allowed to change tires twice throughout the entire championship. The tires used in Formula E are made from natural rubber and recycled fibers, and are specifically designed to perform well in all weather conditions.Despite this difference, Formula E is by no means inferior. While a Formula 1 car can reach speeds in excess of 350 km/h, the new Formula E Gen3 Evo can reach 322 km/h, but it can accelerate faster than a F1 car. It can go from 0-100 km/h in 1.86 seconds., faster than many Formula 1 cars.Although both series use the same chassis, battery, and tires, the real performance differences come from the powertrains provided by each team. There is one aspect where Formula 1 still holds an edge, primarily due to the electric car's battery limitations. As the battery depletes, an electric car loses speed, requiring a pit stop to recharge in a flash. A Formula 1 car, on the other hand, can maintain top speed even with a quarter tank of fuel.Additionally, Formula E cars must be kept light—around 284 kg for the battery, which accounts for one-third of the car's weight that’s fixed at 840 kg, including the driver.Despite the technical differences, Formula E has its own appeal. Even Red Bull driver Max Verstappen has acknowledged how difficult it can be to drive the RB21. In comparison, electric cars in Formula E are simpler, with single-speed transmission and no gear shifts necessary, unlike the multiple gears in a F1 car.Currently, Formula E features 11 teams, with 22 drivers. Unlike Formula 1, where the top speeds are often the focus, Formula E records are typically based on average race speeds. The fastest race in Formula E history took place in Cape Town in 2023, with an average speed of 132.2 km/h.Practice sessions are held on Friday and Saturday, lasting 30 minutes each, giving drivers a chance to fine-tune their performance.Qualifying: Drivers are split into two groups based on their championship standing. Each group has a 10-minute session to set the fastest lap at 300 kW. The top 4 from each group then advance to the ""duels"" stage, where drivers face off head-to-head at 350 kW in a series of quarter-finals, semi-finals, and a final. The winner of the final claims pole position.The top ten drivers receive points using the standard FIA system (25–18–15–12–10–8–6–4–2–1). The pole position winner earns an additional 3 points, while the driver setting the fastest lap (if they finish in the top ten) receives 1 point.Drivers can deploy a combined 8 minutes of Attack Mode during the race. It provides additional power, activated by driving through a designated area of the circuit off the racing line. All Attack Modes must be used before the end of the race.A new feature has been introduced this season. It requires all drivers to make a mandatory 30-second pit stop to recharge their car's batteries at 600 kW. This adds 3.85 kWh of energy (around 10% more) to be used for the remainder of the race.Formula E was founded by Spanish businessman Alejandro Agag, who serves as the company's Chairman, while Jeff Dodds is the Chief Executive Officer. Many may not realize that Warner Bros. Discovery is among its shareholders.","Formula E is the FIA-recognized single-seater world championship.
