What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it

Mikey Madison won the best actress prize for Brooklyn tragicomedy “Anora.”“Conclave,” which stars Ralph Fiennes as a cardinal corralling conniving clergy as they elect a new pope, beat “The Brutalist,” “Emilia Pérez,” Bob Dylan biopic “ A Complete Unknown "" to the top prize. ""Conclave” was also named outstanding British film and took trophies for editing and adapted screenplay.Supporting performer prizes went to Kieran Culkin for “A Real Pain” and Zoe Saldaña for “Emilia Pérez,"" which also won the award for best film not in the English language.Saldaña won for her role as a lawyer who helps the title character transition to a woman and out of a life of crime. She called the film “the creative challenge of a lifetime.”Best actress nominee Karla Sofía Gascón, who stars as the titular transgender ex-cartel boss in “Emilia Pérez,” wasn’t at the ceremony. Gascón has withdrawn from promoting the film, which has 13 Oscar nominations, amid controversy over her social media posts disparaging Muslims, George Floyd and diversity at the Oscars.Audiard has condemned those comments, but in his acceptance speech thanked Gascón and her co-stars Saldaña and Selena Gomez.“I am deeply proud of what we have all achieved together,"" he said.From the BAFTAs to the OscarsStars including Cynthia Erivo, Hugh Grant, Ariana Grande, Lupita Nyong’o, Timothée Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan walked the red carpet at London’s Royal Festival Hall for the awards, known as BAFTAs.The prizes will be watched for clues about who will triumph at Hollywood’s Academy Awards on March 2, in an unusually hard-to-call awards season.They also have a distinctly British accent. The ceremony kicked off with its kilt-wearing host, Scottish actor David Tennant, leading the audience in a rousing singalong of The Proclaimers’ anthem “I’m Gonna be (500 Miles).”Culkin's award came for “A Real Pain,” about odd couple cousins on a trip to explore their roots. The film's writer and co-star, Jesse Eisenberg, took the BAFTA for best original screenplay.“I’d like to share this with my wife, who didn’t come because she didn’t think I’d win,” Eisenberg quipped.“Anora,” about an exotic dancer entangled with a Russian oligarch's son, had been a best picture favorite after winning the top prizes last week at the Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards.“The Brutalist” had nine BAFTA nominations, while “Anora,” the sci-fi epic “Dune: Part Two” and musical “Wicked” hade seven each. “A Complete Unknown” and Irish-language hip-hop drama “Kneecap” received six nominations apiece.Brody won over stiff competition from Fiennes and Chalamet, who plays the young Dylan in “A Complete Unknown.” The other male actors nominated were Grant for his creepy role in the horror film “ Heretic,” Colman Domingo in real-life prison drama “ Sing Sing ” and Sebastian Stan for his portrayal of a young Donald Trump in “ The Apprentice.”Stan, who is also Oscar nominated, said it was “incredibly validating” to get recognition for the film, which initially struggled to find an American distributor. It's an origins story that focuses on Trump's relationship with ruthless power broker Roy Cohn, played by Jeremy Strong.“We were told this was going to be a thankless job that was never going to lead to anything,” Stan said, describing the movie as a “fair” depiction of the president.Best-actress nominees were Madison, Gascón, Demi Moore for body-horror film “ The Substance,” Ronan for “The Outrun,” Erivo for “Wicked” and Marianne Jean-Baptiste for the Mike Leigh drama “Hard Truths.” Erivo or Jean-Baptiste would have been the first non-white performer to win the leading actress BAFTA.Animated caper “Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl” won awards for best animated feature and best family and children’s film.Sci-fi epic “Dune: Part Two” won prizes for sound and visual effects. “The Brutalist” won for cinematography and musical score. Musical “Wicked” took the costume and production design trophies.Rising stars and lifetime honorsBritain’s film academy introduced changes to increase the awards’ diversity in 2020, when no women were nominated as best director for the seventh year running and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white.Most winners are chosen by 8,000 members of the U.K. academy of industry professionals, with one — the Rising Star Award —- selected by public vote from a shortlist of nominees. This year's winner was David Jonsson, star of high finance drama series “Industry” and London rom-com “Rye Lane.”“Star, I don’t know,” he said. “But rising, I guess.”“Willow” and “Return of the Jedi” actor Warwick Davis received the academy’s top honor, the BAFTA Fellowship, for his screen career and work to create a more inclusive film industry.He founded a talent agency for actors under 5 feet tall, because, he said, “short actors weren’t known for their talent, just their height.”BAFTA chairwoman Sara Putt sent a message of strength to everyone hit by last month’s devastating Los Angeles wildfires. Jamie Lee Curtis, a supporting actress nominee for “The Last Showgirl,” was absent because the fires delayed filming on her current work.The event was without a dash of royal glamour this year. Neither Prince William, who is honorary president of the British film academy, nor his wife Kate are attending. The awards coincide with school holidays for their three children.William, 42, sent a recorded video message that was played before the presentation of the Rising Star Award.","Papal thriller ""Conclave "" wins four prizes including best picture.

Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic. In his memoir, Spare, the Duke of Sussex talks about reaching out to a medium with supernatural abilities to communicate with Diana, who passed away in a car accident in Paris in 1997, just before his 13th birthday, The Mirror reported.The Duke received a message from his mother through the psychic, who told him, ""You're living the life she wanted for you."" Harry, now 40, says that the medium also told him his mother was with him ""right now,"" which made his neck warm and his eyes fill with tears. The psychic shared that Diana knew Harry was ""looking for clarity"" and ""feels your confusion."" She added that Diana understood Harry had ""so many questions"" and that answers would come in time.Another anecdote involved Prince Harry’s son, Archie. The psychic reportedly described how Diana’s spirit witnessed Archie accidentally breaking a Christmas tree ornament shaped like Queen Elizabeth. When asked, Harry admitted the incident had occurred, adding that Archie had attempted to fix the ornament.The medium suggested Diana found humour in the situation, delighting in the antics of her grandson she never had the chance to meet.In Spare, Prince Harry also recounts an extraordinary encounter with a leopard during a trip to Botswana with his brother, Prince William. He interpreted the animal’s presence as a comforting sign from his late mother, suggesting that ""everything will be fine."" However, the experience was not without fear, as he briefly worried the leopard might attack.Harry has been candid about the psychological toll of losing Diana so young. As reported by The Mirror, he disclosed a haunting period after her death when he entertained the possibility that she had staged her demise. His anguish led him to repeatedly drive through the Paris tunnel where Diana’s life was cut short, attempting to make sense of the tragedy.","Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic.

Apple removes one of the biggest security features for these users,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-removes-one-of-the-biggest-security-features-for-these-users-in-the-uk/articleshow/118462186.cms,"What Apple has to say about removing ADP

What it means for users

Apple, in a significant move, has disabled its most robust encryption feature, Advanced Data Protection (ADP), for new users in the UK. This decision comes in the wake of the UK government ordering Apple to create a backdoor that would allow access to user data.According to a report by Bloomberg, ADP is an optional feature that provides end-to-end encryption for various iCloud data and offers an additional layer of security for sensitive information like device backups, photos, messages, and more.Apple expressed “grave disappointment” with the situation, emphasising the rising threat of data breaches and the importance of user privacy.“We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy,” the company said in a statement.“ADP protects iCloud data with end-to-end encryption, which means the data can only be decrypted by the user who owns it, and only on their trusted devices,” it added.This move follows reports that the UK government had demanded Apple build a backdoor into its systems for global user data access under the Investigatory Powers Act, essentially allowing officials to compel companies to remove encryption and prohibits them from disclosing such orders.Apple previously called the bill “unprecedented overreach by the government” and that “the UK could attempt to secretly veto new user protections globally preventing us from ever offering them to customers.”Apple’s decision to remove ADP, rather than comply with the backdoor demand, is a direct response to the government’s order.The company reiterated its commitment to user privacy and security“As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will,” Apple added.While existing ADP users have a grace period to disable the feature manually, new users in the UK will not have access to it, raising concerns about user privacy and the potential for increased government surveillance.It also sets a concerning precedent that could encourage other countries to pressure Apple into weakening its security measures, the report says.","Apple has disabled its most robust encryption feature, Advanced Data Protection (ADP), for new users in the UK.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

TikTok's reinstatement in US app stores following a temporary ban has negatively impacted Chinese competitors that had gained traction during the platform's absence, according to a recent report. These competitors saw a surge in popularity after TikTok was removed from Apple and Google app stores, but have experienced a decline since TikTok's return.Citing Sensor Tower data, Bloomberg reported that downloads of apps like Xiaohongshu plummeted 91% since TikTok’s reinstatement five days ago.The Chinese social media app Xiaohongshu, which translates to ""little red book,"" saw a surge in popularity in the US, becoming the most downloaded free app in the Apple App Store on January 15th. This surge occurred despite the platform's predominantly Chinese user base of over 300 million.American users are increasingly turning to Xiaohongshu, with some expressing their disagreement with the US government's concerns about the Chinese ownership of TikTok.TikTok, owned by ByteDance, was temporarily removed from app stores on January 18 due to government pressure to divest the app over national security concerns. This led to a surge in popularity for Chinese rival Xiaohongshu (Red), which gained nearly 500,000 US users.Other platforms like YouTube, Snap, Facebook, and Instagram also saw increased usage during TikTok's absence. However, with TikTok's return to the Apple App Store and Google Play on February 14, the app has reportedly seen more than double its usual download rate, the report said.The app’s reinstatement followed intervention by President Donald Trump , who provided assurances to TikTok and its partners that they would not face penalties for continued operation. While TikTok's app and website remained accessible during the ban, they were unavailable for download until recently.Prior to the reinstatement, Trump had publicly suggested the possibility of the US government taking a significant stake in TikTok, potentially including a role in content moderation.

Unreleased Phone (3a) vs iPhone 16 Pro Max

Nothing apologises

Smartphone brand Nothing recently faced backlash over a misleading camera comparison between its upcoming Phone 3a and Apple’s iPhone 16 Pro Max . In a promotional video, the company claimed that its phone had better video stabilization than Apple’s latest flagship. But viewers were quickly able to spot a problem.Nothing Phone 3a is scheduled to launch on March 4, 2025. The company is expected to introduce both the Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro.Many pointed out that the footage used to represent the iPhone was taken with its ultrawide lens instead of the main camera. This, viewers said, made the iPhone’s stabilization look worse than it actually is, giving an unfair advantage to the Nothing Phone 3a.“At 5:54 shooting video using 0.5x on iPhone vs normal 1x on Nothing is not a fair comparison. Apple is miles ahead in video currently. Try better next time. This little gimmick is not good for your PR,” commented one user on the teaser video on YouTube. “At 5:54, it looks like you shot the iPhone video using 0.5x instead of 1x, and Nothing was recorded in 1x. That’s why Nothing looks better,” pointed another.This has prompted a response from Nothing. In a pinned comment, the company acknowledged the mistake. They explained that footage from different lenses was used throughout the shoot, and during editing, they mistakenly included a clip from the iPhone’s ultrawide lens instead of its main one.“Hey everyone, we shot across all lenses throughout the day (sometimes cycling one-handed on a bumpy road), and in editing, a clip shot using the iPhone 16 Pro Max’s ultrawide lens was mistakenly used in the video stabilisation comparison instead of one shot using its standard lens. There was no intent to mislead, and we’ll be more careful to ensure even greater scrutiny in future comparisons. Appreciate you all keeping us accountable!”, the comment reads.","Nothing Phone 3a is scheduled to launch on March 4, 2025. The company is expected to introduce both the Phone 3A and Phone 3 a Pro.

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.

"Meta opens sign-ups for Community Notes on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-opens-sign-ups-for-community-notes-on-facebook-instagram-and-threads/articleshow/118448499.cms,"Meta has announced that it is now accepting sign-ups for its Community Notes program on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. This new feature allows users to add context to posts they believe are misleading or confusing, similar to the model used by X (formerly Twitter).To become a contributor, users must be based in the United States, be over 18 years old, have a Meta account that is more than six months old and in good standing, and have a verified phone number or enrollment in two-factor authentication. Contributors will be able to write and submit Community Notes, which can include background information, tips, or other details that users might find useful.For a Community Note to be published, it must be agreed upon by users who normally disagree, based on how they've rated Notes in the past. Notes will not be added to content when there is no agreement or when people agree that a Note is not helpful.Meta plans to introduce Community Notes in the United States over the next couple of months and has not yet shared when it plans to bring the feature to additional countries. The company's decision to drop third-party fact-checking in favour of Community Notes has been seen as a move towards unrestricted speech online."," Meta is now accepting sign-ups for its Community Notes program on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads.
