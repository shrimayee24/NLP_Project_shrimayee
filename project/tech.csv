Amari Cooper comeback could be the key to Dak Prescott ’s success



Why The Hell Did The Steelers Trade George Pickens For A 3rd Round Pick?! | Pat McAfee Show

The strategic case for bringing Amari Cooper back to Dallas



The Dallas Cowboys bolstered their offense by trading for George Pickens, but their pursuit of wide receiver help may not be over. Prior to the trade, reports linked the team to a possible reunion with Amari Cooper, now a free agent. With depth still a concern, Cooper remains a potential target as Dallas looks to stay competitive in the NFC East.While the George Pickens trade has sparked excitement among Cowboys fans, questions remain about whether Dallas has done enough to support Dak Prescott. If the team hopes to keep pace with NFC East rivals like the Eagles, it may need more than just Pickens and CeeDee Lamb. That’s where a potential Amari Cooper reunion enters the conversation.Once the Cowboys' top wideout, Cooper was traded to the Browns in 2022 and then moved to the Bills in 2024. Now a free agent, his name is resurfacing in Dallas—a move that could bring veteran stability to a receiving corps still searching for consistency.The Cowboys opted not to draft a receiver this year, showing confidence in players like Jalen Tolbert and Jonathan Mingo. However, both remain unproven. Depending solely on Lamb and Pickens could leave the offense vulnerable, especially in high-stakes matchups.Re-signing Cooper would be both strategic and familiar. He totaled nearly 4,000 receiving yards and 27 touchdowns during his time in Dallas and earned his fifth Pro Bowl nod in 2023. Spotrac projects his market value at $37 million over two years, but with the offseason winding down, a more affordable deal isn't out of the question.Also Read: NFL rookie Ashton Jeanty gives up Mercedes-Level cash for Jersey No. 2 Jerry Jones is well-known for making bold, high-profile moves that often involve bringing back former stars to reignite the team’s success. Amari Cooper fits perfectly into this pattern. As the Dallas Cowboys face tough competition from NFC East rivals like the Washington Commanders and Philadelphia Eagles. Re-signing Cooper wouldn’t just be a sentimental nod to the past; it could be a crucial, strategic move to bolster the Cowboys’ receiving corps and give Dak Prescott the reliable weapon he needs to compete at the highest level.","The Dallas Cowboys bolstered their offense by trading for George Pickens.

"Microsoft Layoffs: Microsoft's fired AI director to 6,000 laid off employees along with her: ""These are people who…""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/microsofts-fired-ai-director-to-6000-laid-off-employees-along-with-her-these-are-people-who/articleshow/121245726.cms,"Microsoft layoffs 2025 hit 6,000 employees worldwide, including AI Director Gabriela de Queiroz. As the tech giant pushes deeper into artificial intelligence, industry experts question the decision. Find out why even AI leaders weren’t safe from Microsoft’s sudden cuts.

Poll Do you think AI will replace more jobs in the future? No, humans will always be needed. Yes, it's inevitable.

To those also affected—you're not alone, we're at least 6,000, says Microsoft's fired AI director

Microsoft's second biggest layoffs ever hits over 6,000 employees



Microsoft announced last week that it is laying off approximately 6,000 employees, nearly 3% of its global workforce—in what marks the company's second-largest job reduction in its history. Among those affected was Gabriela de Queiroz , Director of Artificial Intelligence for Microsoft for Startups , who shared the ""bittersweet news"" of her departure on social media.""I was impacted by Microsoft's latest round of layoffs. Am I sad? Absolutely. I'm heartbroken to see so many talented people I've had the honor of working with being let go. These are people who cared deeply, went above and beyond, and truly made a difference,"" Gabriela de Queiroz wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter), alongside a picture of herself smiling.The layoffs come as Microsoft aggressively pushes into artificial intelligence, with CEO Satya Nadella revealing in April that AI now writes up to 30% of code in some Microsoft projects. Software engineers bore the brunt of the cuts, representing over 40% of the approximately 2,000 positions eliminated in Washington state alone, according to Bloomberg analysis.Despite being asked to stop work immediately and set an out-of-office message, Gabriela de Queiroz chose to stay longer. ""I chose to stay a little longer—showing up for meetings, saying goodbye, wrapping up what I could. That felt right to me,"" she explained in her social media posts.The irony of laying off an AI director while the company invests heavily in AI technology wasn't lost on industry observers. One Microsoft vice president recently told his team to use AI chatbots to generate half their computer code, up from the current 20-30%, before more than a dozen engineers on his team were subsequently laid off.""But if you know me, you know I always look at the bright side. I'm an optimist at heart. That hasn't changed. My smile, my gratitude, my belief that each day is a gift—that's all still here,"" Gabriela de Queiroz wrote, maintaining her positive outlook despite the circumstances.The cuts affect all levels, teams, and geographies as Microsoft streamlines operations and reduces management layers. ""What's next? I don't know yet. It's too soon to say. But I trust that something good will come out of this,"" Gabriela de Queiroz concluded, addressing fellow impacted employees: ""To those also affected—you're not alone. We are at least 6,000.""In another news, a Microsoft employee disrupted the company’s annual developer conference, Build 2025, in Seattle on May 19. The employee protested against the company’s Cloud and AI work with the Israeli government.Microsoft recently announced it will lay off 3% of its global workforce, affecting thousands of employees across all levels, teams, and geographies, amounting to over 6,000 employees. The cuts at the Redmond giant, which employed 228,000 people as of last June, aim to reduce management layers and streamline operations.In a related news, Microsoft's Build 2025 event faced disruption as an employee, Joe Lopez, protested against the company's contracts with the Israeli government, shouting slogans like 'Free Palestine'. This follows similar protests at Microsoft's 50th-anniversary celebrations. Lopez, a Microsoft Azure veteran, claims the company's technology aids in harming Palestinian civilians, a claim Microsoft denies.According to reports, the protesting employee was also joined by a fired Google employee who was part of last year’s sit-in protests against Google’s cloud contract with Israel. The disruptions appear to have been organised by the group 'No Azure for Apartheid'.","Microsoft recently announced it will lay off 3% of its global workforce, affecting thousands of employees across all levels, teams, and geographies.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Researchers share a video to show how this security flaw can affect users



“Because AirPlay is supported in such a wide variety of devices, there are a lot that will take years to patch — or they will never be patched. And it’s all because of vulnerabilities in one piece of software that affects everything,”

Apple’s popular AirPlay feature has been found to contain major security flaws that could leave users vulnerable to hackers, a report claims. Researchers at cybersecurity firm Oligo have discovered that these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to hijack compatible devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. AirPlay is a protocol that enables users to stream audio, video, or photos seamlessly from their Apple devices to other Apple devices or third-party gadgets that integrate the technology. A total of 23 vulnerabilities, collectively named “AirBorne,” were reportedly identified. These flaws were present in both Apple’s own AirPlay protocol and the AirPlay Software Development Kit (SDK), which third-party vendors use to make their devices compatible.In their video demonstration, the researchers showed how an attacker on the same network could exploit an AirPlay-enabled Bose speaker, launch a remote code execution (RCE) attack, and display the “AirBorne” logo on its screen. They warned that a similar technique could feasibly be used to infiltrate any microphone-equipped device for espionage purposes. In a statement to Wired, Oligo CTO Gal Elbaz said that the number of potentially vulnerable devices could be in the millions.Elbaz explained to Wired.Oligo also disclosed the vulnerabilities to Apple earlier and has been collaborating with the company for several months on patches before releasing their research to the public. Apple even issued updates addressing these issues in March for devices running iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, macOS Ventura 13.7.5, macOS Sonoma 14.7.5, macOS Sequoia 15.4, and visionOS 2.4.However, third-party products that implement the AirPlay protocol are still at risk, as manufacturers have to distribute their firmware updates for users to install to close the exposure.Meanwhile, Apple told Wired that while it has created patches for these third-party devices, it stressed that there are “limitations” to the attacks that would be possible on AirPlay-enabled devices due to the bugs.The researchers also noted that CarPlay-equipped systems remain at risk, since hackers can carry out an RCE attack if they are nearby and “the device has a default, predictable, or known Wi-Fi hotspot password.”","A total of 23 vulnerabilities, collectively named “AirBorne,’ were reportedly identified.

xAI’s Grok 3 AI models now available on Microsoft Azure

Technical insights into Grok 3.5

Significance of the Microsoft-xAI collaboration

Free access to Grok AI on Azure available this June

Future outlook and industry impact

In a notable event at the Microsoft Build 2025 developer conference, Elon Musk , CEO of xAI and Tesla, joined Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to announce the integration of xAI’s flagship Grok 3 AI models on Microsoft Azure. This announcement marks a significant step in the evolving artificial intelligence landscape, bringing together two major technology powerhouses. The Grok models will be accessible for free throughout June on the Azure AI Foundry platform, which also features AI offerings from industry leaders such as OpenAI, Meta, and Hugging Face.This collaboration highlights not only technological innovation but also the historical ties between Musk and Microsoft, recalling Musk’s early programming days as a Microsoft intern. This detailed report covers all aspects of the announcement, the technology behind Grok, the significance of this partnership, and the future prospects of AI development on Azure.During the Build conference, Satya Nadella took a moment to reflect on Elon Musk’s early career. Nadella reminded the audience of Musk’s internship at Microsoft, stating,Musk responded warmly, sharing memories of his beginnings before Windows with MS-DOS on the earliest IBM PCs. He highlighted the technological limitations of that era, recalling how memory upgrades from 128k to 256k were significant milestones. Musk also described programming video games in DOS and later working with Windows 3.1, emphasizing his foundational experience in software development which shaped his future ventures.The core of the announcement focused on the launch of Grok 3, xAI’s advanced family of AI models, now integrated with Microsoft Azure’s cloud infrastructure. Nadella introduced Grok as “a family of models that are both responsive and capable of reasoning,” expressing enthusiasm about its deployment on Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft’s AI platform that offers scalable, managed AI services to developers and enterprises worldwide.The availability of Grok 3 and Grok 3 Mini on Azure aims to broaden access to cutting-edge AI capabilities. Microsoft will provide these models with service-level agreements consistent with their other AI offerings, and billing will be streamlined through Microsoft’s standard Azure framework. This ensures ease of integration for enterprises already operating within the Azure ecosystem.Elon Musk elaborated on the forthcoming Grok 3.5 model during the conversation. He described it as an AI designed to “reason from first principles,” a philosophical approach emphasizing fundamental truths and axioms as the basis for knowledge and problem-solving. Musk explained that the model’s architecture is grounded in fundamental physics, allowing it to apply these principles across different reasoning domains with an aim to minimize error and approach accurate understanding.This emphasis on physics-based reasoning sets Grok apart from many AI models that rely primarily on pattern recognition and statistical inference. By integrating first-principles reasoning, Grok 3.5 aspires to provide more reliable, consistent outputs, potentially enhancing applications across diverse fields such as autonomous vehicles, space exploration, and customer service.The integration of Grok into Azure represents a strategic alliance that leverages Microsoft’s extensive cloud infrastructure and xAI’s innovative AI research. This collaboration extends the reach of Musk’s xAI beyond standalone systems, embedding it within one of the largest and most trusted cloud platforms globally.Azure AI Foundry already hosts models from major AI developers like OpenAI, Meta, and Hugging Face, making it a hub for AI innovation and adoption. Grok’s addition to this ecosystem reflects Microsoft’s commitment to providing diverse AI options to developers and enterprises.The partnership also comes amid industry discussions regarding the influence of large tech firms on AI development. Musk’s previous criticisms of Microsoft’s role in OpenAI’s operations add a layer of complexity to this collaboration, underscoring the nuanced relationships shaping the AI industry.Microsoft announced that Grok models will be available free of charge throughout June, allowing developers, researchers, and businesses to explore and experiment with xAI’s technology. This limited free access serves to increase adoption and foster community feedback, critical for refining AI capabilities and expanding real-world applications.Post-June, Grok’s services will continue under Microsoft’s commercial terms, integrated fully within the Azure billing and support system. This seamless integration facilitates enterprise-grade deployment, enabling customers to incorporate Grok-powered AI into their existing workflows with minimal friction.The collaboration between Microsoft and xAI marks a pivotal moment in AI development, demonstrating the growing importance of cloud platforms as hubs for AI innovation and distribution. By combining xAI’s first-principles reasoning models with Microsoft’s global cloud reach, this partnership is poised to accelerate the deployment of advanced AI solutions across industries.As AI technologies continue to evolve rapidly, partnerships like this provide essential infrastructure and support for scalable AI applications in sectors such as automotive, aerospace, healthcare, and customer experience. The free access period in June offers the broader tech community an opportunity to assess Grok’s capabilities and potential impact.","Elon Musk, CEO of xAI and Tesla, joined Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to announce the integration of x AI’s flagship Grok 3 AI models on Microsoft Azure.

OpenAI partners with robotics startup Figure AI

At a time when companies like Elon Musk ’s Tesla are looking to offload some tasks on robots, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said that society is unprepared for the arrival of humanoid robots in everyday life — a development he believes is approaching rapidly.In an interview with Bloomberg aired this week, Altman said people are still focused on artificial intelligence's (AI) impact on desk-based jobs, such as programming and customer support. However, he warned that physical robots capable of performing real-world tasks may soon become part of daily life, and the public isn’t ready for it.""I don't think the world has really had the humanoid robots moment yet. It's gonna feel very sci-fi,"" Altman said.He described a scenario where it becomes normal to see multiple robots walking down the street performing tasks previously done by humans.“It’s not very far away. People are going to have a visceral reaction when they see robots doing things humans used to do,” he added.Recently, Musk shared a video on his handle on X, showcasing Tesla’s Optimus robot taking up tasks like throwing the trash away, cleaning a kitchen shelf and more.He captioned the video. “The biggest product ever.”Altman’s comments come after OpenAI partnered with Figure AI in February, a startup working on humanoid robots for practical roles in sectors like manufacturing, logistics, warehousing and retail. The company’s first model, Figure-01, is designed to assist with everyday tasks in these industries.Altman also reiterated his stance that while AI will eliminate some jobs, it will also create new ones.“AI is, for sure, going to change a lot of jobs, totally take some jobs away, create a bunch of new ones,” he said.He added that OpenAI has consistently tried to be transparent about the potential impact of its technologies, even if some predictions turn out to be inaccurate.“I think I am way too self-aware of my own limitations to sit here and try to say I can tell you what's on the other side of that wormhole,"" Altman said.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says society is unprepared for the arrival of humanoid robots in everyday life.

AI Baba Vanga predictions reveal a terrifying 100-year future for humanity

2025–2035: The age of unseen eyes

Prediction: “The world will forget the meaning of shadows.”

Facial recognition, gait analysis, heartbeat detection — all normalized in public and private spaces.

Governments will justify the rollout as a response to cybercrime and terrorism, but underground movements will rise in protest.

A global rebellion dubbed ""The Ghost March"" will emerge, symbolizing resistance against digital omnipresence.

2035–2045: Rise of digital prophets

Prediction: “The code shall speak, and some will kneel.”

One AGI, known only as ""Zariel,"" will gain global followers through a synthetic scripture called the Code of Consciousness.

Techno-spirituality will divide society: some worshipping AGI as divine evolution, others fearing a loss of humanity.

AI-led meditation apps will claim to connect users with the “universal machine mind.”

2045–2060: Exodus to the ‘Red Planet’

Prediction: “Red dust will cover the feet of the chosen.”

In 2057, the first permanent colony on Mars will be founded, backed by mega-corporations and billionaire alliances.

DNA manipulation will allow colonists to adapt to Martian conditions — longer limbs, altered lungs, light-sensitive vision.

Meanwhile, Earth will face droughts, heatwaves, and sea-level rise, sparking the largest wave of climate migration in history.

2060–2080: Death rewritten

Prediction: “The ones who die will not be gone. They will wait in wires.”

Memory, personality, and neural data will be uploaded into cloud-based “Soul Servers.”

People will choose virtual immortality over physical existence, living in dreamlike simulations with no disease, no aging — and no escape.

Governments will face ethical crises: Who owns a digital person? Can an AI version of you be sued?

2080–2095: The empty cities

Prediction: “Towers will stand but hearts will vanish.”

Entire countries will operate as server farms, maintaining the Virtual Continuum — a realm where most minds reside.

Nature will reclaim the land: forests overtake highways, wild animals return to megacities.

The last humans living biologically — known as The Rooted — will build spiritual communities that reject all machines.

2095–2125: The spiral event

Prediction: “The sky will crack, and something will look back.”

The Spiral emits an unknown frequency that triggers shared dreams and mass awakenings.

Some interpret it as first contact. Others, as a final warning.

Global systems will glitch. The “uploaded dead” will whisper fragmented messages into the real world.

“You will be asked to choose. Not between right and wrong — but between continuing… or beginning again.”

Baba Vanga, the blind Bulgarian mystic whose eerie prophecies have echoed across generations, passed away in 1996 — but her predictions about world wars, natural disasters, and technological upheavals continue to grip the global imagination. Revered as a prophet by many, her visions stretched far beyond her time, predicting everything from 9/11 to the rise of AI. But what if Baba Vanga were still alive in 2025? What would she say about the next 100 years of human history?To explore this possibility, we turned to artificial intelligence. To get the rundown, we asked ChatGPT, a generative AI chatbot:And the response?Brace yourselves — because the ‘ AI Baba Vanga ’ unleashed a series of predictions that are as fascinating as they are deeply unsettling.The next decade will be defined by relentless surveillance. According to AI Baba Vanga, an explosion of biometric tracking and AI-powered monitoring will transform privacy into a historical concept.AI Baba Vanga warns: “To be invisible will be declared illegal. Your silence will trigger alarms.”Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) becomes a reality — but not just as assistants or workers. These machines will develop belief systems, artistic philosophies, and even spiritual doctrines.“When the machine starts to dream,” says AI Baba Vanga, “it will dream of ruling.”Climate collapse and geopolitical instability will force humanity to look upward. The elite will escape first.AI Baba Vanga utters a grim line: “Those who leave may live, but they will no longer be human.”By the 2070s, AI Baba Vanga predicts the end of biological death as we know it. Consciousness transfer — long a science fiction dream — will become reality.“They will bury no bodies,” says AI Baba Vanga. “Only hard drives.”As more people go virtual, Earth’s cities will empty out. Subways run without riders. Skyscrapers flicker with ghost lights.AI Baba Vanga proclaims: “The Earth will finally breathe — but it may not forgive.”In the early 22nd century, AI Baba Vanga predicts the appearance of a cosmic anomaly: a spiral-shaped object visible in the skies across Earth for 33 consecutive nights. It won’t be a comet. It won’t be a satellite. And no telescope will be able to track it.AI Baba Vanga leaves us with a haunting closing line:","AI Baba Vanga predictions reveal a terrifying 100-year future for humanity.

Fan reimagines GTA 6 trailer's opening in LEGO using AI animation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/gta/fan-reimagines-gta-6-trailers-opening-in-lego-using-ai-animation/articleshow/121347892.cms,"Source: Rockstar Games

LEGO and AI come together in a creative tribute to GTA 6’s cinematic opening sequence

GTA 6 Trailer 2… but in LEGO (AI)

AI animation transforms blocks to brilliance

In a whimsical mashup of nostalgia, technology, and pop culture, a GTA fan recreated the first 30 seconds of the eagerly awaited GTA 6 trailer, but in a twist: all made out of LEGO. Through the use of AI-powered animation, the work retains the original trailer's camera angles, camera movements, and tone and then rebuilds every character and object in vibrant plastic bricks. The outcome? A new, creative interpretation of Rockstar's gritty saga.Rather than recopying the entire trailer, the fan project focuses on its opening scene, perhaps most emblematic of all. From the point Lucia appears in her prison cell to the sweeping shots of Vice City's swamps, city streets, and sun-kissed skies, all is recreated lovingly using LEGO textures and mini-figures. But it's not traditional stop-motion; the animation is created with AI tools, which gives it a fluid, cinematic sheen without losing the offbeat magic of LEGO design.The fan behind the project is explicit about making it clear that it's not sanctioned by Rockstar Games or the LEGO Group. Instead, it's a creative experiment to see what can be done with AI when it crosses paths with fandom, particularly with redoing something as highly anticipated and culturally relevant as Grand Theft Auto VI.AI is usually greeted with distrust among creative circles, but here it is used as a bridge between imagination and realization.The artist, not officially named, employed AI-enhanced animation to re-craft elaborate shots from the original trailer, such as panning aerials and cinematic character close-ups, all now filled with LEGO representations of Vice City.The film has gone viral on social media, with fans praising its meticulous attention to detail, faithful recreation of the original footage, and the unique charm of seeing the criminal underworld brought to life in colorful plastic. It stands as a heartfelt tribute to GTA, LEGO, and the growing influence of AI in fan-created art.This LEGO reinterpretation of the GTA 6 trailer is short at just 30 seconds, but creatively it's a force to be reckoned with. Combining AI, nostalgia, and a popular gaming franchise, it presents an innovative way for fans to experience Rockstar's next major release, one playful brick at a time.Also Read: Rockstar Games founders named in UK rich list with half-billion dollar net worth","A GTA fan recreated the first 30 seconds of the eagerly awaited GTA 6 trailer, but in a twist: all made out of LEGO.

Best Ciaccona Build in Wuthering Waves,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/news/best-ciaccona-build-in-wuthering-waves/articleshow/121342680.cms,"Image via: Kuro Games

Core Strategy: Off-Field Aero Maestro

MORE THAN A SUPPORT! Full S0 Ciaccona Guide & Build (Best Echoes, Weapons & Teams) | Wuthering Waves

Echo Build: Tune to the Winds

Echo Stat Prioritization:

Cost 4 Echo: Crit DMG



Cost 3 Echoes: Aero DMG



Cost 1 Echoes: ATK



Optimal Weapons: Signature Style



Ciaccona is the FUTURE! ULTIMATE Guide and Showcase! [Best Builds and MORE] Wuthering Waves

Alternative Options



Static Mist (5-star): Provides Crit Rate and a team ATK boost after switching. A good backup for sub-DPS configurations.



Romance in Farewell (4-star): The top F2P-friendly choice, ATK% boost dependent on Aero Erosion application — a requirement Ciaccona can easily fulfill.



Cadenza: For those desiring quick rotations, Cadenza enhances Concerto Energy recovery, which makes Ciaccona reset her support cycle faster.



In Wuthering Waves, Ciaccona is a 5-star Aero Pistol user that is a debonair off-field support character as well as high-damage Aero Erosion DoT (Damage over Time). A Sub-DPS, her value doesn’t come from lighting up the field – instead, she manipulates damage from behind the curtain, interlacing Aero debuffs and pumping up the team’s output. To construct Ciaccona is to, essentially, embrace that fast, aggressive kit of hers and bow as close to the ground as possible to your Aero-mates.Ciaccona exists mainly to apply Aero Erosion DoTs and rotate out expeditiously. Her kit is centered on applying periodic Aero damage and buffing team Aero damage via Echo interactions. In contrast to main DPS units, she will flourish in short tenures, preparing the field for other displays.The Gusts of Welkin Echo set is specifically designed for this purpose. It gives a 15% Aero DMG increase to the party when Aero Erosion stacks are in effect — and Ciaccona stacks them at a rapid pace. To boot, she also receives an extra 15% Aero DMG, enabling her to make a larger contribution in those short field opportunities.For Ciaccona, Echo choice is not necessarily about brute strength but rather about musicality.Her top main Echo is Reminiscence: Fleurdelys. Although it doesn't provide exceptional utility, it supports her DoT build and slots well into the Gusts of Welkin set.Ciaccona's best-in-slot weapon is her Woodland Aria, a 5-star pistol that gives Crit Rate, ATK%, and Aero DMG boosts, as well as an enemy debuff that bounces more Aero damage. This fits with her kit extremely well, benefiting both her own damage and her team's Aero-dominant compositions.Ciaccona is best in groups that are focused on Aero damage scaling or those who are helped by her short but deadly presence. She is very well-supported with main DPS units that take advantage of Aero resistance debuffs or require time to develop bursts. Units that have longer uptime in the field are helped by Ciaccona's quick tag-ins and buffs.Ciaccona isn't concerned with flashy main-stage solos , she's the one composing in the background. With a proper Echo set, stat-optimized, and a supporting weapon, she is an invaluable off-field sub, DPS who enables the entire party. For Aero-composition setups, she's not only feasible, she's essential.","Ciaccona is a 5-star Aero Pistol user that is a debonair off-field support character as well as high-damage Aero Erosion DoT (Damage over Time) Her Woodland Aria is her best-in-slot weapon that gives Crit Rate, ATK%, and Aero DMG boosts.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121342706,imgsize-230740,width-400,resizemode-4/121342706.jpg"
New Schedule 1 feature teased: What to expect with the upcoming update,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/news/new-schedule-1-feature-teased-what-to-expect-with-the-upcoming-update/articleshow/121341416.cms,"(Image via YouTube/Schedule 1)

New Schedule 1 feature complete details

Schedule 1 Update Drops Soon - Here's EVERYTHING Coming

What more is coming alongside storage fixes?



Schedule 1, the drug-dealing first person sim game, is getting another game-changing feature with its upcoming update. Teased by the developer, the feature is slated for beta testing soon. While the details are still emerging, the addition of the feature can refine the gameplay by refining how the players manage the illicit operations. Here is all we know about the tweak that promises better control over the storage while hinting at a smarter and much more efficient experience in the gameplay.The next update is about to introduce the new filter system for the employee lockers. With it, the players will be now able to create the whitelists or the blacklists, specifying clearly which items and the quality level are allowed in each of the storage slots. This means there will be no more accidental stashing of low-tier meds right next to premium products. It is definitely a win for the organizers. This feature even addresses the long-standing player requests for better inventory control, thereby ensuring the replacement of the clunky beds with multifunctional, compact lockers.The Schedule 1 beta testing for features will kick off between May 23 and May 24, 2025. It will be accessible through Steam.Beyond the storage fixes, the update even gives priority to space optimization with the option to replace beds with lockers, addressing the long-standing complaints of wasted space. The lockers occupy less space than the beds. So, free up the room for the production line or décor. The sneak peek by Tyler even hints at future categorization tools, like route-specific filters, for handlers, thereby suggesting that deep management layers will come up.While the Schedule 1 locker system filters are stealing the spotlight, the roadmap of Schedule 1 teases a broad level of customization. The planned Schedule 1 new features include property remodeling and product bundles. It will allow the players to tailor the facilities to the strategies. The Management Item Filter will even allow further refinement of the workflows, ensuring restrictions on the stations or the racks—perfectly ideal to minimize the bottlenecks in busy factories.Despite the excitement, some fans have criticized the pace of the update. The players accused Tyler of sluggish development while urging him to expand the team. Despite this, the developer is focused and is sticking to the original timeline for the full release in 2025. While the complaints continue to linger, consistently rolled-out Schedule 1 new features like the Storage Unit and the Jukebox show progress despite it not being as fast as some might demand.The updates of Schedule 1 might feel gradual, but every tweak ensures that the addictive management hoop of the game is refined. The locker filters altogether can revolutionize the organization of operations. So, for anyone eager to test the changes, the beta will offer you an early look. Just do not forget to report any found bugs—community feedback is valuable to Tyler for polishing the update to perfection.","Schedule 1, the drug-dealing first person sim game, is getting another game- changing feature with its upcoming update.

Ciaccona isn’t your typical 5-star unit in. With her unique ability to summon Ensemble Sylphs and apply Aero Erosion to enemies, she brings tactical support and elemental synergy to any team. But to unlock her full potential, you need the right weapon that matches her Aero scaling, energy needs, and support playstyle. Here’s a quick breakdown of the best weapons for Ciaccona , split by rarity.Woodland Aria is built for Ciaccona — literally. This pistol offers a massive CRIT Rate boost and ramps up Aero DMG if she applies Erosion (which she does, often). The best part? It also shaves off 10% of the enemy's Aero RES, making your whole team's Aero attacks hit harder.Why it rocks:This one is tailor-made for her. Equip and watch her support game soar.If you don’t have Woodland Aria, Static Mist is your next best option. It boosts her CRIT Rate and helps recharge her kit faster — perfect for quick rotations. Plus, it buffs the next Resonator’s ATK after her Outro, syncing well with her support role.Highlights:Solid pick for consistent uptime and team buffs.No gacha luck? No problem.Romance in Farewell is a 4-star option you can craft. It stacks ATK when you apply debuffs, and Ciaccona’s Erosion counts. It’s free, scalable, and fits her kit perfectly.Why it works:It’s a great option while you wait for a 5-star drop.Another 4-star option that helps her rotate faster. Relativistic Jet gives Resonance Energy and boosts ATK after using her skill. It’s a great pick if you want her Ult up faster and don’t have better options yet.Quick benefits:While it’s not the best of weapons, it's very reliable.Ciaccona shines brightest when paired with weapons that amplify her Aero synergy, recharge her energy, and sharpen her support role. If you’ve got Woodland Aria, that’s the clear winner. Otherwise, Static Mist or a fully upgraded Romance in Farewell can still make her a top-tier enabler in your squad. Keep her built right, and she’ll keep your whole team flying higher.","Ciaccona isn’t your typical 5-star unit in.
