NEW DELHI: Taking a leaf out of former chief election commission er (CEC) T N Seshan’s book, the Election Commission has asked its Bihar poll machinery to set up separate enclosures for identification of ‘purdanasheen’ women voters in the polling stations, using innovative but locally available, inexpensive materials like charpoys and bedspreads.Implementing the directions issued by the Seshan-led EC in 1994, the current commission has directed the Bihar chief electoral officer (CEO), district election officers (DEOs) or returning officers (ROs), assistant ROs and presiding officers to create these enclosures to ensure that no woman stays away from voting purely due to lack of privacy and other required facilities at polling stations.The poll body will identify areas and polling stations with significant number of veil-wearing women and ensure that adequate lady staff, including at least one woman polling officer, are included in the polling parties. “Separated enclosures for identification of purdanasheen women should be provided in the polling station with locally available but absolutely inexpensive devices and using local ingenuity, such as use of charpoys or cloth such as bed spreads.The 1994 instructions also sought the deployment of at least one lady polling officer in polling stations where the number of women electors is 50% or above and where the system of burqa or purdah is observed as a social custom.In polling stations exclusively meant for women electors, the polling personnel shall have as many lady officers as available, consistent with overall security requirements.In other polling stations too, at least one lady polling officer shall be appointed for identifying and assisting women voters. The services if lady village level workers or anganwadi workers, gram sevikas and lady school teachers shall be used for identification of purdahnasheen women voters.Also, where women polling staff are not available in adequate numbers, the returning officer or presiding officer may appoint any woman as an attendant to assist women electors and also the presiding officer in respect of women electors. Care should be taken to ensure that such attendants do not have any known leanings for allegiance to any political party or candidate.Some of the reasons cited in the 1994 instructions, for the low women voter turnout was included social and religious taboos, particularly among purdahnasheen women of a particular community or women of certain other communities observing the purdah system in the presence of family and village elders, or to sentimental reasons in some tribal areas.",The Election Commission has asked its Bihar poll machinery to set up separate enclosures for identification of ‘purdanasheen’ women voters.

“Your ability to manage a hybrid team of human and AI resources will play an essential role in the success of the company’s employees.""

4 tips Marco Argenti shared with Goldman Sachs' employees



“get creative with AI, posing provocative, non-obvious questions.”

“While AI excels at refurbishing existing knowledge its true creative potential is unlocked by human curiosity,""

“The expert will curate a personal toolkit of models and assistants and know[s] which one to deploy for which task,"" he explained

“plausible-sounding errors.”

“A blend of deep knowledge and a detective’s scepticism,”





Goldman Sachs chief information officer (CIO) Marco Argenti believes professionals can succeed in the AI-driven workplace by focusing on collaboration and questioning rather than competing with machines. In a recent company Briefings newsletter (as seen by Fortune), Argenti outlined four strategies on how employees canas autonomous systems take on tasks previously reserved for humans. Argenti's advice centres on adapting to the AI transition by learning how to conduct, question, and collaborate with the new technology. This approach is intended to help professionals thrive as AI reshapes workplaces globally. In the newsletter, Argenti wrote:Argenti suggests that today’s professionals need to shift from simply executing tasks to coordinating them. Success, he explains, will depend less on individual output, such as writing code or performing analysis and more on managing agile teams composed of both human and AI contributors. Effective leadership will involve delegating, coordinating, and integrating their work to achieve outcomes that neither could reach alone.According to Argenti, curiosity is one of the most valuable human abilities in an AI-driven world. He encourages employees toWhile AI systems are strong at processing existing information, they rely on human curiosity to spark new ideas. By asking imaginative, unconventional questions, people can help AI move beyond familiar patterns and reveal deeper insights.Argenti wrote.Argenti also recommends that professionals use a mix of AI tools tailored to specific tasks rather than relying on a single platform. No one model performs best in every situation, he notes. The advantage lies in understanding which tools are most effective for particular purposes, such as data analysis, writing, or coding and combining them into a personalised digital toolkit.Argenti further warns that even advanced AI systems can generateAs these tools become more integrated into work processes, checking their accuracy will require domain expertise and careful evaluation.he writes, will help distinguish reliable insights from misleading ones.Argenti concludes that AI is not replacing human ability but changing how it is defined. The future, he says, will favour those who combine technical understanding with creativity, critical thinking, and leadership qualities that remain uniquely human.","Goldman Sachs CIO Marco Argenti outlines four strategies on how employees can succeed in the AI-driven workplace.

"Milestone for AI in science: Google AI generates cancer hypothesis later validated by scientists, says Sundar Pichai",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/milestone-for-ai-in-science-google-ai-generates-cancer-hypothesis-later-validated-by-scientists-says-sundar-pichai/articleshow/124599530.cms,"

How Google AI is decoding cancer through cellular language



Discovery of a potential cancer therapy pathway



Transforming scientific discovery



Open access for global collaboration





In a significant development for AI in biomedical research, Google ’s C2S-Scale 27B foundation model, developed in collaboration with Yale University and based on the Gemma framework, has successfully generated a novel hypothesis about cancer cell behaviour. This hypothesis was later experimentally validated in living human cells, marking an important step forward in the integration of artificial intelligence with laboratory science.Google CEO Sundar Pichai hailed the development as a major advance in the partnership between AI and laboratory science. He emphasised that the discovery could guide future preclinical and clinical research, potentially revealing new pathways for cancer therapy.At the core of this achievement is the C2S-Scale 27B model’s exceptional capacity to ""understand"" biology. The AI system was trained on over one billion single-cell profiles and transforms raw molecular data into what researchers call “cell sentences.” With this approach, the AI can interpret cellular communication and context, essentially learning the “language” of cells.As biotech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson explained, the model “listened” to what cells were signalling and produced a hypothesis that real biological experiments later confirmed.This fluency in cellular patterns marks a turning point for AI’s role in biomedical discovery, enabling it to reason about complex systems and propose new ideas rather than simply summarising existing knowledge.The C2S-Scale 27B model produced a hypothesis suggesting that the drug silmitasertib could significantly boost antigen presentation in cancer cells by almost 50% under conditions of low interferon. Antigen presentation is the process by which tumour cells display fragments of abnormal proteins on their surface, signalling the immune system to recognise and attack them. By enhancing this mechanism, silmitasertib could make previously “invisible” tumours detectable to immune cells, strengthening the body’s own ability to fight cancer.Experiments conducted in human cell models confirmed the AI’s prediction. This finding is particularly promising for tackling “cold tumours,” a type of cancer known for bypassing immune detection and resisting conventional therapies. If these results are validated in further preclinical and clinical studies, they could open the door to new immunotherapy approaches, offering fresh hope for patients with cancers that are notoriously difficult to treat.This milestone represents a turning point in how AI can contribute to medical research. Rather than merely analysing existing datasets, AI systems like C2S-Scale 27B are now capable of generating entirely new scientific hypotheses, bridging the gap between computational prediction and experimental validation. Researchers emphasise that extensive preclinical and clinical testing is still essential before these AI-driven insights can translate into viable treatments for patients.Even so, this achievement demonstrates the transformative potential of AI as a true partner in science, capable of accelerating discovery, sparking innovation, and guiding research in ways that were previously unimaginable.In an effort to democratise cutting-edge biomedical research, Google has made the C2S-Scale model publicly available on platforms such as Hugging Face and GitHub. This transparency allows scientists worldwide to explore the model’s capabilities, test its predictions, and build upon its foundation.","Google’s C2S-Scale 27B foundation model has successfully generated a novel hypothesis about cancer cell behaviour.

DON'T MISS This Mission To Get An Early KANTO Starter In Pokémon Legends: Z-A - How To Guide

How to Mega Evolve Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander



Starter Pokemon have their own charm, particularly the Kanto starters, i.e., Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle. They have been present across various games, and they have now made a return in the new Pokemon Legends: Z-A.Although you can only choose one of the three during the main story, all three of them are later available once you are done with the same. Additionally, the game also features their Mega Stones, allowing you to Mega Evolve them. In this guide, we take a look at how you can obtain Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander early in Pokemon Legends Z-A.Essentially, the only way you can get the Kanto starters during the main storyline is as part of Side Mission #22 named ""A Call From Mable."" This mission gets triggered after you heal your Pokemon at a Pokemon Center. Although the other requirement of triggering this side mission is not specified, some players have reported that you get this after completing around nine side missions and reaching Rank W.Once the mission is triggered, you will receive a call from Mable directing you to the Pokemon Research Lab in the southern area of the city. You must simply go there and head to the top floor, where you will find her.You will then find all three Kanto starters standing there, with Mable offering you the choice to select between Charmander, Squirtle, or Bulbasaur. You must choose wisely, as you can only pick one at this point. Besides getting one of these Kanto starters, this side mission will also provide you with these rewards: 1,000 Poke Dollars, three Extra Small Exp. Candies, and two small Exp. Candies.All three starters are available later in your playthrough; however, you can only catch them after you complete the main story. Essentially, they will appear in Wild Zone 20, where you will be able to catch them.One major incentive for having any of the three Kanto starters is their access to Mega Evolutions in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. The Stone Emporium on Vernal Avenue sells evolution stones and Mega Stones for various Pokemon, including Charizardite and Blastoise's Mega Stones. In the meantime, Venusaurite can be obtained through a special battle later in the main story.This was all you needed to know about obtaining and Mega Evolving the Kanto starters.","How to get Kanto starters early in Pokemon Legends: Z-A (A Call From Mable side mission) All three starters are available later in your playthrough; however, you can only catch them after you complete the main story.

Q: What are some examples of career cushioning?

Q: Is career cushioning only for people in certain industries?

Q: How often should I review and update my career cushioning efforts?

Q: How do I know if my career cushioning efforts are working?

Q: How much time should I be dedicating to career cushioning?

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

This spin-off became an immediate success, delivering a continuous stream of safe, animated, and totally catchy musical content entirely in Arabic. In short? Wanasah comes from a pedigree of entertainment heavyweights, which is why it maintains such high production quality and reaches nearly every home in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region via satellites like Nilesat and Badr-4.Wanasah TV, often recognized by its main character, Lulu (لولو), didn't just become popular by accident. It nailed the delicate balance between what kids want (fun, singing, and colorful cartoons) and what parents demand (safety, education, and positive values).Getting the channel on your TV is easier than ever.

Who are the Talibros? Meet the content creators braving Afghanistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/who-are-the-talibros-meet-the-content-creators-braving-afghanistan/articleshow/124609483.cms,"Taliban Fighting India’s Proxy War Against Pakistan, Says Khawaja Asif Amid Afghan Ceasefire Doubts

The Big Picture



What’s Happening



Why It Matters



The Background



What’s Next







It’s the kind of video you’d expect to stumble upon on a jihadist message board in 2004: three hooded hostages kneeling, their captors standing grim-faced behind them, Kalashnikovs poised like punctuation marks. The lighting is harsh, the script familiar — a finger jabs at the air, a threat is uttered, and you brace for the worst.Except this time, the script flips. The hood comes off, and instead of a terrified prisoner, there’s an American influencer with a movie-star grin and a cheery “Welcome to Afghanistan!” The scene cuts to pull-ups on tank barrels, selfies with Kalashnikovs, and tourists laughing in the shadow of a regime that once banned music and stoned women.This is not satire. It’s marketing — part of a growing trend in which a new breed of social-media provocateurs, dubbed “Talibros,” are repackaging Taliban-controlled Afghanistan as the ultimate offbeat travel destination. Their content straddles the line between shock humour and soft propaganda, turning a war-scarred theocracy into a backdrop for clout-chasing, contrarianism, and a very modern kind of ideological theatre.The Talibros are not journalists, historians, or analysts. They’re content creators — mostly men, mostly Western — who package Taliban-ruled Afghanistan as the ultimate contrarian experience. Their message is simple and seductive: everything you’ve heard is wrong.They insist that women aren’t oppressed because they’re visible in marketplaces. That Taliban fighters aren’t dangerous because they crack jokes on camera. That a country that banned female education past the age of twelve and removed women’s books from universities is simply “misunderstood.”The aesthetic is part Vice gonzo reporting, part frat-house vlog, and part soft-focus propaganda. And it works — because it flatters an audience exhausted by “mainstream narratives” and eager to believe that they, not the gullible masses, are finally seeing the “real story.”Aryubi’s video was just the start. Addison Pierre Maalouf, better known as Arab to his two million YouTube subscribers, shot to fame touring Afghanistan’s “women’s markets.” He mugs for the camera, pretending astonishment that women speak in public, while an overlay of a Western news headline flashes on screen: Taliban Bans Women from Speaking. The implication: media hysteria. The reality: women remain subject to draconian restrictions, their public presence tightly policed and their educational prospects gutted.Meanwhile, Kurt Caz, a South African travel vlogger, shifted from filming dangerous neighbourhoods in Venezuela and Kenya to walking the streets of Frankfurt with far-right activists, complaining about “illegal migrants” and dubbing the city “Crackfurt.” The pivot is revealing: the Talibros no longer just document “risk” abroad — they now weaponise it at home, warning young Western men that their cities will collapse too.It would be comforting to dismiss this as fringe stupidity — testosterone tourism with a side of irony. But the Talibros are playing a bigger game. They’ve mastered the algorithmic dark arts of the attention economy: weaponise distrust, monetise outrage, and flatten complexity into punchy, meme-able contrarianism.They know that traditional media is suffering a credibility crisis. Only a quarter of under-50s say they trust the news to report “fully and fairly.” Into that vacuum step the self-anointed truth-tellers, promising real insight while building parasocial empires on YouTube and Patreon. Once viewers stop trusting journalists, they don’t turn sceptical — they turn loyal. Loyal to them.The irony is that the Talibros aren’t selling reality at all. They’re selling a feeling — the dopamine hit of believing you’re in on a secret, that you’re smarter than the “sheeple.” And the deeper that feeling runs, the harder it is to shake.Travel content has always flirted with danger — explorers trekking through war zones, vloggers sneaking into North Korea, influencers chasing adrenaline in “forbidden” places. But the Talibros have twisted that instinct into something more ideological.They’re heirs to a lineage of online provocateurs — Andrew Tate, Sneako, and the wider “red pill” sphere — who discovered that contrarianism isn’t just viral, it’s profitable. And they’ve applied that playbook to geopolitics: destabilise consensus, cherry-pick anecdotes, mock expertise, and present yourself as the only reliable narrator.Political economist William Davies captured this shift in Nervous States: when objective truth collapses, intuition becomes king. Facts don’t matter; vibes do. And nobody manipulates vibes better than a charismatic man with a GoPro, a grievance, and a Taliban escort.The Talibros are unlikely to fade — if anything, they’re a preview of the future. As platforms reward outrage over nuance and audiences grow hungrier for “unfiltered” content, the algorithm will keep boosting their blend of irony and ideology. Mainstream influencers like the Nelk Boys and Jake Paul, once prank-peddlers, are already edging into similar territory.The danger isn’t that audiences will start idolising the Taliban. It’s subtler — and more corrosive. It’s that they’ll stop believing anyone but the provocateurs. That truth will become just another aesthetic choice. That everything — beheadings, misogyny, religious extremism — will be reduced to content.And once that happens, the Talibros won’t just be influencers with a gimmick. They’ll be architects of a new kind of ignorance — one that laughs as it rewrites history, monetises trauma, and sells a war-torn nation as the latest backdrop for a YouTube thumbnail.","A new breed of social-media provocateurs, dubbed ‘Talibros,’ are repackaging Taliban-controlled Afghanistan as the ultimate offbeat travel destination.

The spirit of Diwali should be one of inclusivity, not inconvenience. Any public celebrations should aim to bring people together rather than create noise or disruptions.









As of 2025, Dubai’s population has crossed seven million, and nearly two million Indian expatriates make up the city’s largest and most close-knit community. For them, Diwali is far more than a festive occasion — it’s a vital cultural anchor in a city defined by ambition and relentless pace.Every year, Dubai lights up with Diwali celebrations that span the entire spectrum: spectacular public events with government-approved fireworks and laser shows, elaborate displays in shopping malls and hotels, and intimate gatherings across Indian residential hubs such as Bur Dubai, Karama, and Discovery Gardens.But behind the glow lies a framework of order. Dubai’s strict regulations govern everything from firecracker use and event permits to public safety and crowd control.The big question every Diwali celebrant asks is simple: Are fireworks banned in Dubai? The answer is both yes and no. While private use, sale, and possession of fireworks are strictly prohibited, licensed and government-approved venues are permitted to hold official pyrotechnic displays.This means fireworks can light up the sky, but only where authorities have given explicit permission. Illegal fireworks, whether set off in residential areas or sold without a license, are treated as explosives under UAE law.Penalties include up to 3 months imprisonment or a fine of up to AED 5,000 for selling, using, or distributing fireworks. Additionally, parents can be held legally accountable if minors are involved in illegal fireworks use.Ahead of Diwali, authorities conduct rigorous enforcement campaigns, seizing illegal fireworks to prevent unsafe neighborhood celebrations. Residents are encouraged to report any suspected illegal activity through the Dubai Police app or by calling 901.For those legitimately aiming to host fireworks displays, securing a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority is mandatory. However, this option is limited to businesses only, specifically for entertainment purposes—not individual residents. The application process is straightforward, involving online registration, instant approval upon payment, and a fee structure that includes AED 2,000 plus small administrative charges.In essence, fireworks in Dubai are a privilege reserved for official, regulated events. This tight framework reflects the city’s commitment to safety, order, and respect for its diverse population during Diwali.So, where can you dive into the Diwali fun and catch dazzling fireworks lighting up the Dubai sky? The city has confirmed several key spots where fireworks displays and vibrant festivities will take place. These government-approved events are free and open to everyone, offering fantastic opportunities to engage with the celebrations and enjoy the festival’s sparkle.The authorized fireworks schedule for Diwali 2025 is as follows:Visitors should plan to arrive early given the expected large crowds. Dubai Police and the Department of Economy and Tourism (DET) actively monitor these venues to maintain safety and crowd control.But Diwali in Dubai extends beyond fireworks. Several key locations offer vibrant cultural experiences throughout the festival:The waterfront transforms into a cultural Diwali village with traditional décor, floating diyas, heritage market stalls, and live performances as part of the immersive Noor Festival experience from October 17–19.The Indian Pavilion comes alive with cultural dance shows, handicrafts, vibrant décor, and street food. Fireworks light up the sky on select nights, making it a festive hotspot for all ages.Home to the spectacular IMAGINE light and fountain show synced to Bollywood hits, the mall also features Diwali-themed shopping deals, Indian food pop-ups, and family-friendly entertainment across the promenade.Expect Diwali-themed light projections on the world’s tallest tower and musical performances at the Dubai Fountain, offering dramatic visuals and ideal photo backdrops for visitors and residents alike.These buzzing neighbourhoods are a sensory overload of lights, music, and colour. Streets overflow with sweet shops, festive markets, traditional attire, and last-minute Diwali shopping well into the night.Together, these venues reflect the city’s vibrant, multicultural embrace of Diwali, catering to families, expatriates, tourists, and long-term residents alike.Among the many vibrant Diwali festivities across the city, one stands out as the official, government-backed centerpiece: Noor: Festival of Lights, running from October 17–19 at Souk Al Seef. Organized by the Dubai Festivals and Retail Establishment (DFRE) under the Department of Economy and Tourism (DET), in partnership with the Indian Consulate and Teamwork Arts, this spectacular flagship event transforms the historic waterfront into a lively cultural Diwali village filled with music, art, and community spirit.Highlights include:“Noor,” meaning “light” in Arabic, embodies the spirit of Diwali, symbolizing unity, renewal, and togetherness. Organizers present it as a “home away from home” for Dubai’s Indian community and a celebration that bridges cultures within the city’s diverse fabric.As the city comes alive with lights, music, and celebration, there's also a growing reminder: Diwali in Dubai isn’t just about enjoying the spectacle—it’s about doing so responsibly. In a place as diverse and densely populated as this, festivities should uplift the community experience, not disrupt it. Authorities and civic leaders are urging residents to be mindful, respectful, and clean as they take part in the celebrations.Dubai’s law enforcement and safety departments will be closely monitoring public areas during Diwali. Residents are encouraged to enjoy all official events but are reminded that any illegal or inconsiderate behavior will be met with firm action.","Dubai’s confirmed Diwali fireworks will take place at Al Seef on October 17 and Global Village on October 18, 19, 24, and 25.

Upcoming Natural History Museum Abu Dhabi

Guggenheim Abu Dhabi (under development)





Opening in Abu Dhabi’s Saadiyat Cultural District, the Zayed National Museum will offer a comprehensive and immersive journey through the history of the United Arab Emirates. Honouring the legacy of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the museum is set to become a cultural cornerstone reflecting the UAE’s past, present and aspirations for the future.Set to welcome visitors on December 3, 2025, the Zayed National Museum will stand as the official national museum of the United Arab Emirates. Located in the Saadiyat Cultural District in Abu Dhabi, it is dedicated to the life, vision, and values of the UAE’s Founding Father, the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.Developed under the Department of Culture and Tourism – Abu Dhabi, the museum is envisioned as a space where history, culture and innovation converge. Mohamed Khalifa Al Mubarak, Chairman of the department, described it as a living institution that tells “the story of our land, our people, and our heritage” in a way that is inclusive, evolving, and grounded in knowledge and education — values Sheikh Zayed upheld throughout his life.The opening date — December 3 — is symbolic, falling just before UAE National Day, further emphasising its role as a national tribute.According to an official post by the Abu Dhabi Media Office, the launch also marks the city’s strengthened position as a global hub for cultural dialogue and education.The museum was designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Lord Norman Foster of Foster + Partners. The structure reflects both modern sustainability practices and deep cultural roots. One of its most distinctive features is five towering steel structures designed to resemble falcon wings in flight, symbolising falconry’s importance in Emirati tradition.Spanning a carefully curated pathway, the museum experience begins at Al Masar Garden, a 600-metre landscaped route starting from the Saadiyat coastline. It connects the Louvre Abu Dhabi to the Zayed National Museum and the upcoming Natural History Museum Abu Dhabi.The garden features native plants from desert, oasis, and urban environments, along with a working falaj irrigation system, sculptures, multisensory installations, and a timeline highlighting Sheikh Zayed’s life and milestones in UAE history. This outdoor gallery sets the tone for the immersive historical journey that continues inside.Inside, the museum will showcase over 3,000 artefacts, of which 1,500 will be on display. These objects were chosen for their ability to convey the stories of the land and its people, from ancient times to the modern UAE.Together, these galleries form a chronological, thematic, and sensory-rich narrative of the UAE's past, guided by Sheikh Zayed’s enduring influence.To mark the inauguration, a comprehensive programme of performances, tours, workshops, and interactive activities will offer visitors a wide range of experiences. The museum aims to appeal to all generations, encouraging both discovery and engagement with the country's story.On-site dining options will include:Ticketing details have been announced:The Zayed National Museum will join a growing cluster of world-class institutions within the Saadiyat Cultural District, alongside:As a central pillar in this cultural hub, the museum represents not just a proud tribute to the past but also a vision for the UAE’s cultural future — a place of dialogue, education, and creative shared heritage.With its doors set to open on December 3, 2025, the Zayed National Museum is poised to become one of the most important and significant cultural institutions in the region, offering a deeply rooted yet forward-looking innovative perspective on the story of the United Arab Emirates.","The Zayed National Museum will open on December 3, 2025.

Dubai deploys fully autonomous AI traffic system to detect road violations in real time without human input,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-deploys-fully-autonomous-ai-traffic-system-to-detect-road-violations-in-real-time-without-human-input/articleshow/124596890.cms,"Dubai unveils Intelligent Traffic System (ITS) at GITEX Global 2025, an AI traffic system automating traffic surveillance. Image: X

A smarter approach to road safety

Real time detection of five critical violations

Not wearing a seatbelt – Detects whether drivers and passengers are properly restrained. Using a mobile phone while driving – Monitors for illegal mobile phone usage during vehicle operation. Obstructing traffic flow – Flags unnecessary actions that impede smooth traffic movement. Stopping in the middle of the road without valid reason – Identifies vehicles halted inappropriately on roadways. Tailgating – Detects failure to maintain safe following distances between vehicles.

Instant updates and in-depth analytics

Supporting Dubai’s smart city goals





Dubai has introduced a fully autonomous Intelligent Traffic System (ITS), leveraging artificial intelligence and real-time video monitoring to identify and document major traffic violations instantly. Unveiled at GITEX Global 2025, the system aims to transform road safety enforcement and streamline traffic operations across the emirate through automation and smart data use.Dubai Police’s newly launched ITS operates without human intervention and is designed to detect traffic offenses as they happen. Built as a unified digital platform, the system incorporates live surveillance feeds and advanced data analytics to monitor driver behavior and flag violations.The ITS represents a significant shift in how traffic laws are enforced, moving routine tasks from field officers to an AI-driven system. According to Lieutenant Engineer Ahmad Al Hammadi, the automation of these responsibilities frees up police personnel for more strategic duties, ultimately improving operational efficiency and decision-making. He described the system as “smarter, fairer, and more efficient,” underlining its role in supporting Dubai’s broader vision to become a globally recognised smart and safe city.The Intelligent Traffic System is engineered to target five specific driver behaviors that have been identified as major threats to road safety:Each violation is captured in real time using AI-analyzed footage and immediately logged into the system with high accuracy.One of the system’s standout features is its ability to provide live updates on the number of vehicles being monitored and the violations recorded at any given moment. This constant stream of data gives authorities an up-to-date view of traffic compliance levels across the city.Beyond real-time monitoring, the ITS generates comprehensive statistical data on vehicle movement patterns. The analytics are broken down across different timeframes - hourly, daily, and yearly, allowing traffic planners to understand behavioral trends and optimize enforcement strategies accordingly.The statistical output is also crucial for improving emergency response capabilities by identifying congestion hotspots and predicting areas where quicker interventions may be necessary.The launch of the Intelligent Traffic System is in alignment with Dubai’s long-term objectives to enhance road safety and efficiency through digital transformation. By automating key aspects of traffic enforcement, the platform not only reduces the margin for human error but also introduces a fairer, more transparent and accountable mechanism for holding drivers responsible.As the system gradually scales and integrates further into city-wide operations, it is expected to serve as an effective model for other modern urban centers aiming to implement smart traffic governance through advanced technology.","Dubai Police’s newly launched ITS operates without human intervention and is designed to detect traffic offenses as they happen.

Get married online via video call from anywhere: Abu Dhabi launches Dh800 virtual wedding service,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/marry-over-video-call-from-anywhere-abu-dhabi-launches-dh800-virtual-wedding-service/articleshow/124577665.cms,"Abu Dhabi launches online wedding service via TAMM app. Image: File

TAMM App’s process for fast, legal online marriages

UAE leads the Gulf with remote weddings





Couples in Abu Dhabi can now get legally married with just a few taps on their phones, thanks to the innovative marriage service launched on the government’s TAMM app - all for Dh800 (approximately $217). The all-digital service enables couples anywhere in the world to complete their marriage legally through a secure online ceremony, marking a new milestone in the emirate’s drive for smart government services.The TAMM app, which consolidates over 1,100 government and private sector services onto a single platform, now offers this seamless marriage solution under the supervision of the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department. Through a WebEx video link, the couple, two witnesses, and a licensed officiant join the wedding ceremony virtually. Even guests can participate remotely, eliminating the need for physical presence anywhere in the UAE. For couples residing abroad, a power of attorney can represent them locally during the ceremony.Describing the feature as a matter of convenience, Hammad Alhammadi, executive director of customer care and happiness sector at TAMM, said, “Even if you visit Abu Dhabi, you are able to log into and transact on services through Tamm, and one of them will be the marriage contract,” and added, “It's getting a lot of momentum right now.Maybe [it loses the romance] if you're getting married, but can also be very helpful. ”Couples seeking attested marriage certificates can pay an additional Dh300 for the app to automatically attest the document through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and deliver a secure digital version. Instead of traditional physical stamps, the marriage certificate now carries a UAE Pass digital signature. The entire streamlined process from document submission to ceremony scheduling can be completed within 24 hours if couples book an appointment in advance and have all necessary paperwork.To safeguard legal compliance and prevent underage or forced marriages, the marriage service is integrated with the UAE Pass and Emirates ID systems, verifying applicant identities and eligibility.Mohamed Al Askar, who heads the Abu Dhabi government TAMM application, told AFP at the Dubai-based Gitex Global 2025 tech fair: ""It's open to everyone. Whoever wants to get married in Abu Dhabi, regardless of their nationality, can get the service online. People can go online, they can do the whole transaction without the need to go to any physical place. We are among the first to do that.""The UAE stands out as the only Gulf nation allowing foreigners to enter into non-religious marriages, and this latest initiative reaffirms Abu Dhabi’s leadership in digital public services. Inspired by preliminary online marriage services introduced during the Covid-19 pandemic and modeled on innovations from countries like Ukraine, Abu Dhabi’s digital wedding experience is among the world’s first to facilitate fully remote, cross-border civil marriages.Lauding the transformative nature of TAMM AutoGov, His Excellency Ahmed Tamim Hisham Al Kuttab, Chairman of the Department of Government Enablement - Abu Dhabi, told Timeout: “The launch of TAMM AutoGov is truly transformative, redefining what government means in people’s lives. Here, government is no longer reactive. It’s a partner that is intelligent, human-centered, and present at the moments that matter most. With the world’s first transactional AI public servant, Abu Dhabi is showing the world what anticipatory government looks like.”In essence, Abu Dhabi’s new online marriage service through the TAMM app offers couples a modern, convenient, and legally recognized way to wed quickly—whether they’re residents, citizens, or overseas—with full government backing and digital certification that embraces the future of smart governance.",Abu Dhabi launches online wedding service via TAMM app. All-digital service enables couples anywhere in the world to complete their marriage legally through a secure online ceremony.

UAE: Too good to be true? Sharjah Police warn of ‘dream car’ scams targeting buyers and sellers online,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-too-good-to-be-true-sharjah-police-warn-of-dream-car-scams-targeting-buyers-and-sellers-online/articleshow/124573542.cms,"Scammers use professional car photos and ultra-low prices, along with pressure tactics like “many are interested,” to trick buyers into paying deposits before vanishing/ Representative Image

How the scam works: A ""dream car"" that disappears after the deposit

A Tempting Dream – A product that feels out of reach is suddenly available at an irresistible price;

A Symbolic Price – So low it suspends disbelief and encourages rapid action;

Flashy Photos – Professional visuals add legitimacy to the fake listing.

Sellers also targeted: Fake payments and forged documents used to steal vehicles

The real defence: Verification, caution, and critical thinking

For buyers:





View the vehicle in person before making any financial commitment;

Request and inspect ownership documents;

Verify the identity of the seller, including matching ID to vehicle registration;

Be cautious of suspiciously low prices, especially those paired with pressure tactics.

For sellers:





Do not release the vehicle until payment is confirmed and cleared in your bank account;

Treat all payment confirmations and receipts as suspect until verified with your bank;

Be wary of buyers using urgency or false documentation to push early handovers.

For all users:





Sharjah Police encourage anyone who encounters a suspicious listing or request to report it immediately by calling 80040, the designated hotline for such fraud cases.

Authorities take action: Public warnings and swift arrests





In a sharp warning to the public, Sharjah Police have exposed a rising wave of highly orchestrated online vehicle scams targeting both buyers and sellers. The frauds, which prey on emotions and override logical decision-making, have led to significant financial losses across the UAE. As part of their proactive response, Sharjah Police released an official awareness video cautioning residents to carefully verify every step and promptly report suspicious activity without delay.The fraudulent scheme typically begins on popular classified platforms or social media, where visually polished ads present luxury or desirable vehicles at prices far below market value. The low price point is not accidental—it is designed to sidestep skepticism and provoke emotional decisions.Victims report being lured by high-quality car images, quick responses from the ""seller,"" and urgent messaging claiming other buyers are interested. This pressure, often phrased as ""first to pay gets the car,"" manipulates urgency, pushing the buyer to act without verifying the offer.Once a deposit is transferred, communication ceases. Calls and messages go unanswered, and the advertisement vanishes. In nearly all cases, the car is non-existent, and the fraudster is unreachable.According to Sharjah Police, the scam is structured around a pattern of psychological triggers:Police stress that this tactic isn’t random—it’s a deliberate attempt to bypass logic and exploit emotional vulnerability. Victims aren’t just deceived; they’re manipulated into self-convincing belief.In a separate but connected criminal scheme, sellers of vehicles have also become victims. A criminal gang, recently apprehended by Sharjah Police, targeted private sellers through platforms where vehicles are listed for sale.The perpetrators would express interest, make an attractive offer, and follow up with a falsified payment receipt claiming that funds had been transferred and were awaiting deposit. Using forged identification and persuasive communication, the scammers would convince the seller to hand over the car, believing the payment was in progress.In reality, no money was ever transferred, and by the time the scam is uncovered, the vehicle is gone.This variation of the scam highlights how both buyers and sellers are vulnerable in digital transactions—particularly in unregulated online environments where identity and payment verification are minimal or entirely absent.To combat this rising threat, Sharjah Police are calling on the public to remain alert and follow essential verification steps before engaging in any online vehicle transactions.In response to the increasing frequency of these crimes, Sharjah Police have intensified public awareness campaigns, including the release of an official video outlining the key tactics scammers use. These efforts aim to educate the public about how modern frauds rely more on emotional manipulation than obvious deception.A senior police officer explained that many victims “failed to verify and didn’t ask”, emphasizing that excessive trust and lack of due diligence are the two main vulnerabilities exploited.Police have also acted swiftly in high-profile cases. In one instance, a criminal group running an online car scam was arrested within just 12 hours. This shows the authorities’ strong commitment to curbing economic crimes in the digital space.","Sharjah Police have exposed a rising wave of highly orchestrated online vehicle scams targeting both buyers and sellers.

This year's edition marks a significant milestone as it welcomes international fashion icons Vivienne Westwood and Stella McCartney to the Kingdom's fashion stage for the first time.The style revolution kicks off on October 16 with a show that's pure, electric fusion: the Middle Eastern runway debut of Vivienne Westwood. But this isn't just a transplant of a London catwalk. In a move that brilliantly honors local artistry, the house is collaborating with Art of Heritage by Princess Noura Al Faisal.Imagine: iconic British punk aesthetics, the rebellious cuts, the historical references, the sheer attitude—set against the serene backdrop of a Riyadh palm grove.The collection will feature specially created embroidered gowns, a direct result of mixing Westwood's couture team's expertise with the exquisite craftsmanship of local Saudi artisans.

Get ready for a breathtaking blend of anarchy and elegance.Dame Vivienne Isabel Westwood (1941–2022) was not born into high society; she came from a modest working-class family in Tintwistle, Derbyshire, England. Her father worked as a storekeeper and her mother was a skilled weaver. Westwood's achievements are marked by a unique blend of anarchy, historical reference, and fierce activism. She defined the look of punk, introducing anti-establishment imagery, bondage gear, safety pins, and provocative slogans to fashion. After punk was widely co-opted, Westwood turned to history for bold inspiration. Her first official runway collection,(1981), launched the influential ""New Romantic"" movement. Subsequent collections revived historical cuts like the bustle and the mini-crini, cementing her global reputation as an innovator who fused history with contemporary rebellion.Bringing the spectacular week to a thoughtful and luxurious close on October 21 is the regional debut of Stella McCartney.

Her debut cements Riyadh Fashion Week as a platform not only for style but for substance, emphasizing the Kingdom's commitment to building a modern fashion ecosystem rooted in ethical and future-facing values.Stella Nina McCartney CBE (born 1971) was born into a world of both celebrity and conscious living. She is the daughter of The Beatles' legendary singer-songwriter Sir Paul McCartney and the late American photographer and devoted animal rights activist, Linda McCartney. McCartney's career is defined by her unwavering commitment to ethical sourcing and sustainable innovation.While the international icons are drawing the global gaze, Riyadh Fashion Week remains fiercely dedicated to shining a brilliant light on the incredible talent thriving within the region. Over 30 runway shows and presentations will celebrate a diverse lineup that spans high couture, contemporary ready-to-wear, and street-smart menswear.

AI takes office: Abu Dhabi unveils world’s first AI-powered public servant at GITEX Global 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/ai-takes-office-abu-dhabi-unveils-worlds-first-ai-powered-public-servant-at-gitex-global-2025/articleshow/124556927.cms,"Abu Dhabi’s TAMM AutoGov is world’s first AI public servant / AI-generated illustrative image

TAMM AutoGov: Abu Dhabi unveils the world’s first AI public servant

What TAMM AutoGov will do for citizens?

Less paperwork and fewer missed deadlines for residents.

Faster processing of basic services (licences, permits, renewals).

More personalised notifications for example, reminders timed to your preferences.

How it’s built and who’s behind it?

Ethics, privacy and the practical checks citizens should watch for

How and where their data is stored and who can access it.

What “automation levels” mean in practice (which actions are fully automatic vs. prompted).

How to correct mistakes if the AI completes a service incorrectly.

Why this is different and what to expect next?





Imagine your driving licence renewing itself, or bills getting paid before deadlines that’s what Abu Dhabi’s new AI-powered public servant TAMM AutoGov promises, marking a new era of proactive governance unveiled at GITEX 2025.At GITEX Global 2025, Abu Dhabi rolled out TAMM AutoGov, described by authorities as the world’s first transactional AI public servant a major upgrade to the TAMM super-app that lets government services act proactively on behalf of people. The launch is part of Abu Dhabi’s broader plan to become an “AI-native” government by 2027 and is presented as a move from reactive service delivery to “anticipatory governance. ”TAMM AutoGov is built to reduce routine friction by automating recurring tasks and offering proactive service prompts. Examples given by officials include renewing licenses, managing scheduled payments and completing multi-step transactions with user consent. Users can set personal preferences and choose automation levels — meaning the system could, with permission, complete some services for you before you ask.The aim is to make government touchpoints faster, personalised and less dependent on repeated manual requests.Why this matters in plain terms:Abu Dhabi’s rollout doesn’t stand alone — it’s backed by major industry partners and a strategic technology push. The Department of Government Enablement (DGE) is working with global vendors and local partners to embed AI and cloud infrastructure that meet sovereign security needs. Industry collaborations announced around the same time (including work with NVIDIA and Oracle on sovereign AI infrastructure) point to high-performance computing and cloud platforms powering these services. This combination aims to deliver scalable, secure AI services that handle sensitive public data while running complex models fast enough to enable real-time automation.An AI that acts for you raises immediate questions, consent, data use, transparency and error handling. Officials stress that TAMM will allow users to set automation levels and personal preferences, but citizens should still check:Because the initiative handles transactional public services, independent audits, clear opt-in flows, and human-in-the-loop safeguards will be crucial to trust and legal compliance. Abu Dhabi frames this program as secure and sovereign, but observers and residents should watch the published privacy policies, service-level commitments and any third-party audits.Abu Dhabi isn’t just adding a chatbot, it’s attempting systemic change: move public services from “respond when asked” to “anticipate and act.” If successful, the model could cut friction for routine tasks, improve uptake of entitlements, and reduce backlog in public services. Expect a staged rollout, early pilots for low-risk services, and growing visibility of the technology stack and governance safeguards as it expands. Keep an eye on future announcements about scope, third-party audits and how citizens can control or opt out of automation.","TAMM AutoGov is the world’s first transactional AI public servant.

Bollywood Pickle - Jar label: a dancing couple, tagline: “Spicy Like Cinema!” It’s mango achar that smells like a film set and tastes like drama.

Royal India Biscuits: Manufactured in Ajman, “imported from India” (questionable), these biscuits come in tins showing tigers and temples. The flavor? Vanilla-ish nostalgia.

Indian Frozen foods that defy expectation

.

The Unlikely Suspects: You walk past the frozen Okra (Bhindi) and Drumsticks (because who has time to chop that ?), and then you see them: trays of Frozen Gajar ka Halwa (carrot pudding). Yes. A dessert that takes four hours of slow simmering is now a pop-it-in-the-microwave affair. Who buys this? Everyone.

The Tiffin Box Time Warp: Another unexpected hero is the individually packed, frozen 'Mini-Meals' or thalis . These aren't fancy; they're the food equivalent of a comfort blanket, containing exactly two rotis , a dollop of dal , and a generic vegetable curry. They exist because the alternative is spending your one weekend day cooking seven meals.

The Frozen Samosa Pyramid Scheme: The sheer volume of frozen samosas and kebabs sold in the UAE is a phenomenon in itself. They're sold in colossal, family-sized packs, often manufactured in a nearby country just to keep up with the overwhelming, year-round demand for instant, deep-fried comfort.

The unseen force: Why are people eating this?

thalis

The 9-to-5 Compromise: The biggest force is the Relentless Work Schedule. When you're working 9-to-5 (or 9-to-9) in Dubai, convenience trumps authenticity. It’s a choice between a 5-minute frozen thali and ordering another pricey takeaway. The freezer wins.

The UAE Logistics Mastermind: This is the ultimate comedy of the UAE market. If someone, somewhere, in the two million-strong Indian community, demands a frozen item, the market will find a way to import it, manufacture it, and stock it even if it's the most time-consuming dessert ever conceived. The demand is so high, it's a guaranteed profit. The market is literally bending to the will of nostalgia.

Weird demands from non-desi shoppers

The ""Mild Curry Powder"" Mission: Foreigners walk in demanding the ""safest, least spicy curry powder."" The staff, who measure chili heat on a scale that goes up to ""Volcanic Eruption,"" will hand them a bag labeled ""Daily Mild Masala,"" which is still spicy enough to activate a smoke alarm. The hilarious reality is that even the mildest option is a culinary challenge, reinforcing the idea that Indian food simply refuses to be truly bland.

The Search for 'The Sauce' : After eating pani puri on the street, tourists often return searching for the ""green liquid that tasted like mint and heaven."" They aren't looking for pudina chutney; they are looking for The Elixir of Life, and they can't quite describe the exact combination of herbs, tamarind, and chili required. The staff often just hand them a generic, slightly sweetened coriander sauce, knowing they'll never quite replicate the street vendor magic.

Walk into any “Indian grocery” in the UAE, and you’ll instantly feel two things: nostalgia and mild cultural whiplash. The smell of cardamom and detergent hits you, Bollywood songs play from a small Bluetooth speaker, and you spot a pack labelled “Taj Mahal Pasta – Real Indian Taste. ”Wait… pasta? Taj Mahal ? Real Indian taste?Congratulations, you’ve entered the world of UAE’s Desi Grocery Oddities, where nostalgia meets marketing gone rogue, and half the shelves are stocked with items that would make your Indian relatives blink twice and whisper,There’s an entire aisle of “Made for expats” brands that existin the Gulf.

"Dubai to become first city outside US with Elon Musk’s Boring Company Loop system, 17 km phase 1 by 2026",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-to-become-first-city-outside-us-with-elon-musks-boring-company-loop-system-17-km-phase-1-by2026/articleshow/124545152.cms,"Dubai’s 17 km underground Loop by Elon Musk’s Boring Company promises fast, cool, futuristic rides, launch expected in 2026 / Images courtesy of official X posts from @rta_dubai and @boringcompany

What exactly is the Dubai loop?

Builder: The Boring Company (founded by Elon Musk in 2016)

(founded by Elon in 2016) Length (phase 1): ~17 km (10.6 miles)

Stations: ~11, including major commercial and residential hubs

Capacity: 20,000 pph initially

Speed: Up to 160 km/h (100 mph)

Expected opening: 2026

The big reveal: Who announced the Dubai loop and when

What is the Boring Company and Elon Musk’s role in the Dubai loop?

Founder & Visionary: Musk drives the concept, pushing for rapid innovation and testing unconventional transport methods.

Track Record: The company’s first major project, the Las Vegas Convention Center Loop, operates a short route using Tesla pods. It serves as a prototype for larger city networks.

Dubai Loop Role: The Boring Company will construct and operate the initial 17 km network, design pods and stations, and integrate technology for safety and speed. Musk’s personal vision shapes ambitious timelines and futuristic features, like high-speed electric pods and minimal surface impact.

Why Dubai wants the loop: Solving heat, traffic, and time





Fast Commutes: Trips that take 30–60 minutes could drop to minutes.

Weather-Proof Transit: Underground tunnels mean no sun, no sand, no sweating.

Zero Emissions: Electric vehicles mean no pollution or noise.

Smart Integration: RTA plans to sync the Loop with Metro, tram, and bus systems for seamless connectivity.

Timeline and progress: How real is the 2026 goal?





Dubai’s daily traffic jams could soon be history. Elon Musk ’s Boring Company is digging deep to build the Dubai Loop, a 17-kilometre underground electric transit system slated for 2026. Announced by the UAE’s AI Minister Omar Sultan Al Olama at GITEX 2025, the ambitious project aims to whisk commuters across the city in minutes, combining speed, sustainability, cutting-edge technology, and sci-fi flair.Think of the Dubai Loop as a series of underground tunnels where small electric vehicles — Teslas or custom pods zip passengers through tubes at speeds up to 160 km/h (100 mph).Instead of heavy metro trains, these vehicles run continuously, aiming to transport about 20,000 passengers per hour in the first phase. Future expansions could scale that up to 100,000 passengers/hour as more tunnels are added.This system isn’t a metro replacement but a new layer of rapid micro-transit, designed to beat congestion, heat, and long commutes with zero emissions.The story broke when UAE’s Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Omar Sultan Al Olama, revealed that Elon Musk’s The Boring Company is set to open the Dubai Loop in 2026. The announcement came during GITEX 2025, Dubai’s massive annual tech expo, where innovation headlines are the norm but this one stole the show.The minister highlighted that Dubai would be the first international city outside the United States to roll out The Boring Company’s Loop system, following its pilot in Las Vegas.Bloomberg first reported the statement on October 13, 2025, followed by Reuters, The National, and Gulf News confirming details through the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA). According to the RTA, the initial route will span around 17 km and include 11 stations, forming the foundation for a wider city network.The Boring Company is a US-based infrastructure and tunnel construction firm founded by Elon Musk in 2016. Its mission is to reduce surface traffic congestion by building underground transportation tunnels for electric vehicles.Musk, known for Tesla and SpaceX, envisioned tunnels as a high-speed, climate-controlled alternative to traditional roads and metros, with smaller vehicles moving continuously instead of waiting for large trains.Key points about the company and Musk’s involvement:In short, Musk is the ideal driver, The Boring Company is the builder, and Dubai provides the bold canvas for the project’s international debut.Dubai’s roads are famously efficient but also famously busy. With rapid population growth, tourism influx, and scorching summers, the city faces three transport challenges: congestion, sustainability, and comfort.The Loop answers all three:It’s also an image play: Dubai wants to cement itself as the global capital of future mobility, joining flying taxis, autonomous vehicles, and AI-driven public transport already in trials across the emirates.The official statement from the UAE minister sparked excitement but also skepticism. While The Boring Company has proven technology in Las Vegas’ Convention Center Loop, Dubai’s version is much larger and more complex. Still, the optimism from UAE officials signals strong government backing; a key success factor in Dubai’s mega projects.The Dubai Loop fits neatly into the UAE’s ambitious National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 2031 and Smart Mobility Vision 2040, aiming to automate 25% of all trips through autonomous or AI-assisted transport. If successful, the Loop could dramatically slash surface congestion, create thousands of jobs in tunneling, AI, and operations, set a bold precedent for other GCC cities, and make Dubai a global living laboratory for next-gen infrastructure. Behind it all is Elon Musk’s Boring Company, the visionary tech firm turning this futuristic concept into reality. Musk’s personal drive and the company’s deep tunneling expertise are central to making Dubai’s bold underground transit dream — what they call “transport at the speed of thought” — a tangible reality.","The Dubai Loop is a 17-kilometre underground electric transit system slated for 2026.

A worldview shaped by scepticism and context



Vox’s bet on depth over drama



A new chapter for American political journalism







Most of American media this autumn seems fixated on Bari Weiss — her move to CBS, the endless debates about what it means, and the predictable churn of culture-war commentary that follows her everywhere. But while the spotlight has been trained firmly on her, a far more significant shift in political journalism is happening quietly, without the fanfare or the headlines: Astead W. Herndon is leaving The New York Times to join Vox, a move that could reshape how millions of Americans understand politics in the years to come.Beginning October 20, 2025, Herndon will step into a dual role as editorial director and host at Vox, leading a new weekly video podcast on politics and society and driving a multiplatform storytelling effort that spans audio, video, text, and membership content. He will also guest-host Today, Explained alongside Noel King, bringing his distinctive voice to one of Vox’s flagship shows. The goal is simple but ambitious: to create political journalism that speaks beyond Washington’s inner circles and meets audiences where they actually are.Herndon’s career has always been defined by a refusal to accept the conventions of political reporting. A Chicago native and Marquette University graduate, he began his career at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and The Boston Globe, before joining The New York Times in 2018.There, he quickly distinguished himself as one of the most incisive chroniclers of American politics — someone less interested in the tactical manoeuvres of campaigns than in how those manoeuvres play out in the lives of ordinary people.His reporting treated voters not as polling data but as protagonists, and his work consistently explored how race, class, geography, and inequality intersect to shape political behaviour. That people-centred approach culminated in The Run-Up, the Times’ politics podcast, where Herndon dug beneath the surface of elections to examine the deeper structural forces at work in American democracy. It also earned him widespread acclaim, including the National Association of Black Journalists’ Journalist of the Year award and the Distinguished Journalist Award from DePaul University in 2025.What sets Herndon apart is not just his storytelling skill but his worldview — one defined by curiosity, scepticism, and a relentless focus on context. He rejects simplistic narratives that reduce politics to destiny — such as the assumption that demographic change inevitably benefits one party — and he is equally critical of campaign coverage that obsesses over messaging at the expense of meaning.Herndon has called out progressive elites for talking at voters instead of with them, and he has criticised conservative strategists for weaponising resentment while ignoring the material conditions that shape people’s lives. But his work is not about scoring partisan points. It’s about asking deeper questions: Why do people believe what they believe? How do those beliefs form? And what does that mean for how power actually operates?This diagnostic approach — one that sees politics not as spectacle but as a living system of power — is also the driving philosophy behind his next chapter. “Meeting audiences where they are,” as Herndon often puts it, isn’t just a slogan. It’s a reorientation of how political journalism should function in an era of polarisation, distrust, and disinformation.Herndon’s move comes as Vox itself embarks on a broader reinvention. Founded in 2014 to close the gap between news and public understanding, the organisation now wants to build deeper, more nuanced narratives across multiple platforms — narratives that don’t just explain what is happening in politics, but why it matters.Editor-in-chief Swati Sharma explained why Herndon is central to that mission: “When I think about the kind of talent I want at Vox, I keep coming back to two things: a voice that feels authentic and deeply connected to people, and someone who truly understands how to use audio, video, and text to reach audiences wherever they are.”That approach is particularly relevant at a time when political coverage is too often defined by outrage cycles, pundit brawls, and fleeting viral moments. Vox’s bet is that Herndon’s work — rooted in depth, clarity, and context — can cut through that noise and build a more durable connection with audiences who feel alienated by traditional political reporting.The stakes could hardly be higher. As America heads into the 2026 midterms and gears up for a pivotal 2028 presidential election, the need for journalism that explains rather than inflames has never been more urgent. Herndon’s task is not simply to report on politics but to make sense of it — to map the forces shaping democracy and translate them into stories people can use to navigate a chaotic political landscape.In that sense, his move is more than a career transition. It’s a statement of intent: that political journalism can still be meaningful, relevant, and deeply connected to the public it serves. And if Herndon succeeds, his work at Vox could do more than change how politics is covered — it could change how it’s understood.",Astead W. Herndon is leaving The New York Times to join Vox. The move could reshape how millions of Americans understand politics in the years to come.

Sora meets satire







Weekend Update: Gen Z Men are Becoming





From archive to AI





Comedy’s new frontier





Saturday Night Live’s Colin Jost found himself in a deeply awkward situation during this week’s “Weekend Update” when co-host Michael Che unveiled an unexpected surprise: a video showing Jost at a party with President Donald Trump and the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein The clip, originally filmed in 1992 at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, is well-known for capturing Trump and Epstein laughing and chatting at a lively party — years before Epstein’s criminal cases came to light. But this time, there was a twist. Thanks to the wonders of artificial intelligence, Jost’s likeness had been digitally inserted into the scene, dancing around the two men as if he had been there all along.Che explained that the video had been created using OpenAI ’s video generation tool, Sora, and joked that Jost had been “partying” with Trump and Epstein. As the doctored footage rolled, Jost grimaced, shook his head, and glanced at the audience before deadpanning, “Really excited for that to just be out there.” Che, sensing blood in the water, kept piling on the jokes, much to the crowd’s delight — and Jost’s clear discomfort.The original 1992 footage has long circulated online, often resurfacing during discussions about Trump’s relationship with Epstein. Although Trump has repeatedly denied being close to the disgraced financier, photographs, flight logs, and social interactions tell a more complicated story.A recently surfaced letter — allegedly from Trump to Epstein and featuring a crude sketch of a naked woman — has only added fuel to the controversy, though Trump insists it’s a fake and has launched defamation suits over its publication.The SNL stunt captured a cultural inflection point: the merging of cutting-edge AI technology with late-night comedy. What was once the realm of deepfakes and online disinformation has now become a tool for satire — one that can both entertain and unsettle.For Jost, the gag was an uncomfortable collision of history, technology, and humour. For SNL, it was a glimpse of comedy’s future: a world where the past isn’t just referenced but rewritten, pixel by pixel, in real time. And for viewers, it was a reminder that the line between fact and fabrication is no longer a line at all — it’s a punchline.",Saturday Night Live’s Colin Jost found himself in a deeply awkward situation this week.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Realme's Chase Xu on partnering with Ricoh for GT 8 smartphone series: The industry has not seen such a collaboration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/realme-cmo-chase-xu-on-partnering-with-ricoh-for-gt-8-smartphone-series-the-industry-has-not-seen-such-a-collaboration/articleshow/124609824.cms,"There are two key points. First, we focus on street photography. Never before has the industry done any collaboration specifically targeting snap or street photography, because we understand that young people have a higher demand for taking great snap photos instantly on their phones. Second, this is a very deep collaboration, aiming to be the industry's deepest imaging partnership.

We spent four years preparing for it and closely collaborated with Ricoh GR throughout the entire product design process and workflow.

For every step, both companies are deeply involved. So the two things that differentiate us from others are our effort and time to ensure the ultimate user experience.”

What Ricoh executive Kazunobu Saiki said about the partnership





“This is a very strategic collaboration with Realme. To be frank, we got many other projects from other smartphone manufacturers, but mainly they are targeting badges, which is not of our interest. We believe Realme shares the same idea. They never want just a badge; we pursue the power of street photography for the younger generation. This is a very good collaboration. Fifteen years ago, the camera industry thought smartphones would replace cameras, but I never agreed because smartphones like Realme can create real creativity, starting from the young generation. This expands street culture, and we can begin to start the next generation together.”

Realme CMO Chase on integrating AI on GT 8 smartphones





AI was not used in GR mode to respect Ricoh GR’s authenticity and film-era experience. However, GT8 Pro incorporates cutting-edge AI imaging technologies for creative editing, such as AI removal and festive photo enhancements. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 processor enables enhanced AI features with an on-device experience.”

Microsoft introduces Copilot Actions on Windows 11: What is it and how it works,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-introduces-copilot-actions-on-windows-11-what-is-it-and-how-it-works/articleshow/124609538.cms,"How Copilot Actions works





Microsoft has announced new Copilot and agentic experiences for Windows 11. Called the Copilot Actions, it is designed to let AI perform real tasks on behalf of users — such as managing files, updating documents, booking tickets, or sending emails — directly within Windows. Microsoft said that the new feature expands on its earlier Copilot Actions for the web that was first introduced in May. With the latest update, Microsoft is bringing these capabilities to local files and apps on Windows, allowing Copilot to act more like a digital coworker than just a virtual assistant.The software giant said that Copilot Actions will soon be available to Windows Insiders through Copilot Labs, where users can preview the experimental mode and provide feedback.Microsoft describes Copilot Actions as an AI agent that can “click, type and scroll” like a human to complete complex tasks using the apps and data already on a PC. It uses vision and reasoning to understand what the user needs and then carries out the task step by step — but only after receiving permission from the user.This means that Copilot can take action directly on local files, offering help with day-to-day work such as editing, organizing or writing.Users can monitor its progress, approve or stop actions at any time, and even take control if needed.In an official release, Microsoft outlined several agentic security principles to make sure the AI works safely and transparently. As highlighted by the company, each AI agent will have its own dedicated account, separate from the user’s main account, with limited permissions that users can adjust or revoke at any time. All agents must be signed by trusted sources to prevent malicious software from posing as AI assistants.To further strengthen security, agents will work within a contained workspace, isolated from the main user environment. Users will be able to see what the agent is doing, approve sensitive actions, and ensure their data stays private.","Microsoft has announced new Copilot and agentic experiences for Windows 11.
