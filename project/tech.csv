New Delhi is set for a bright, winter-sunny day on Saturday, January 24, 2026, with comfortable afternoon temperatures and a distinctly cool start. The forecast indicates largely dry conditions, making it suitable for outdoor activities. However, yesterday’s air quality was in thebracket, and lingering pollution can still make the air feel harsh even when the sky appears clear. Therefore, keeping a mask handy is sensible, especially near busy roads.Today’s weather forecast predicts clear skies, a cool morning, and a mild afternoon. Saturday is expected to reach a high of approximately. The low temperature is forecast to be about. This results in an average temperature near, which is characteristic of late-January weather in Delhi. Skies are anticipated to remain sunny throughout the day. Rainfall is considered essentially negligible, with approximatelyexpected and achance of rain. This allows for planning errands or outdoor time without concerns about showers.Humidity levels are expected to average around. This can contribute to mornings feeling a bit crisper. Afternoons, however, should feel more comfortable under the sun. Winds are projected to be light to moderate. A peak wind speed nearis anticipated. This level of wind is sufficient for a mild breeze.However, it is not the kind of wind that meaningfully disperses pollution.Through the day, a familiar pattern is expected. This includes a chilly early morning period. A pleasant warm-up is anticipated by late morning. The best window for outdoor activities is in the early-to-mid afternoon.

This level signals air that can be unhealthy for everyone, not just sensitive groups.Particulate matter remained a significant concern following Friday's conditions. Levels ofwere recorded atlevels reached. These fine particles are strongly linked to various health issues. Such issues include throat and eye irritation, coughing, and headaches. They can also cause flare-ups of asthma or allergies. These effects are particularly noticeable during commutes and near construction or traffic corridors. With today’s weather being sunny and largely calm, the air may appear cleaner than it actually feels. Without strong winds or rain, pollution often disperses slowly. In summary, the sunshine is welcome, but it does not automatically mean breathable air.If heading out, layering up is advisable. A warm top is recommended for the morning chill. Something lighter should be worn underneath for the midday sun. Sunglasses will be helpful in the bright afternoon. Given yesterday’s, a well-fitting mask remains a smart idea for outdoor exercise, long rides, or time spent at intersections.Outdoor workouts should ideally be scheduled for late morning to early afternoon. This is when the cold bite eases. Individuals with respiratory issues should keep exertion light. Preferring parks over roadside stretches is also recommended for these individuals.

Life survives where fog reaches land

A desert shaped by human use and neglect





The Atacama Desert lies along the northern edge of Chile, a long strip pressed between the Pacific Ocean and the Andes. It is often described as the driest place on Earth, though that description feels almost too neat. According to Discovery , in some parts, rainfall averages around 0.03 inches a year. In others, rain has not been recorded within living memory. The ground shows it. Stone replaces soil. Salt lakes dry into hard white plates. Nothing seems recent. Yet the desert is not remote in the usual sense. It sits beside the largest ocean on the planet, close to ports, roads and cities. That contrast shapes how the region feels. Water is near, but it does not arrive. The desert remains exposed, quiet, and largely unchanged by weather.The Andes rise sharply to the east, creating a barrier that keeps wet air from leaving the continent. To the west, the Pacific sends clouds inland, which rarely lead to rain. The frigid Humboldt current cools the air near the surface, while warmer air remains above. Thunderstorms give way to fog. Low clouds glide across hills before disappearing.This pattern does not change often. High-pressure systems linger. Seasons pass without interruption. The end outcome is not a catastrophic drought, but a consistent absence. The landscape slowly adjusts. Nothing grows fast. Nothing disappears soon either.Most of the interior remains almost empty of vegetation. In some areas, even dead plant matter does not decompose. Researchers have found organic remains that may be thousands of years old. This stillness is part of what draws scientists. Space agencies test Mars equipment here because the ground behaves in unfamiliar ways.Closer to the coast and along isolated hills, the picture changes slightly. Fog collects on slopes, feeding small plant communities. Bromeliads draw moisture directly from the air. Short-lived plants appear briefly, then vanish. Around 550 plant species exist in these pockets, many found nowhere else. Animals remain few. Insects, scorpions, lizards and small birds form fragile chains that break easily.The Atacama also holds vast deposits of sodium nitrate. Mining reshaped parts of the desert in the early twentieth century. Towns appeared, then emptied. Buildings still stand, preserved by the dry air. Tools rust slowly. Roads lead nowhere.Today, the desert continues to attract attention, though for different reasons. NASA scientists, astronomers and engineers arrive, then leave. The land absorbs little of their presence. The Atacama does not respond quickly. It does not offer clear signals. It remains dry, cool, and unresolved, holding its distance even as people study it closely.","The Atacama Desert lies along the northern edge of Chile, a long strip pressed between the Pacific Ocean and the Andes.

The world’s largest beaver dam is so big that you can see it from space,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/the-worlds-largest-beaver-dam-is-so-big-that-you-can-see-it-from-space/articleshow/126520430.cms,"AI-generated

A beaver dam hidden in Canada is clearly visible from space

The actual size of the beaver dam is impressive

This beaver dam was discovered from space

Why beavers build on this scale

What the dam means for the wider park





Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada, which includes northern Alberta and parts of the Northwest Territories, is home to the largest beaver dam ever documented. The structure is located deep within the park, far from roads, towns, and established paths, making it inaccessible by foot. It is so large that it can be seen in satellite photographs from orbit. The dam is approximately 775 metres long at its front edge and spans an area of around 70,000 square metres, keeping back a substantial volume of water. It was initially discovered in 2007 using satellite imaging rather than terrestrial exploration. Further investigation revealed that the dam did not exist before 1980, implying that it was developed over several decades by multiple generations of beavers operating in the same spot.Wood Buffalo National Park spans northern Alberta and parts of the Northwest Territories. It is Canada's largest national park and among the world's largest protected places. The beaver dam is located deep within it, far from roads, cities, and recognised trails.Walking to the place would take several days. The terrain is challenging and slow. Wetlands extend over large distances. Muskeg collapses under weight.The boreal forest closes in densely. Most people who saw the dam up close did not walk there. They arrived on private sightseeing planes, looking down rather than approaching on the ground.According to Parks Canada , from end to end, the front of the dam measures roughly 775 metres. That is close to seven football fields laid side by side. The entire perimeter of the dam area approaches 2,000 metres. Its surface area covers about 70,000 square metres.The pond created behind the dam is thought to be around one metre deep. That would place the volume of water at roughly 70,000 cubic metres. Another way to see it is through scale. A standard dump truck carries about 10 cubic yards. By that measure, the dam holds back the equivalent of more than 90,000 dump trucks of water. Seen as ice, it would fill around 1,600 hockey rinks.According to BBC Wildlife , no explorer stumbled across this dam by chance. No ranger logged it during patrol. It was first noticed in 2007, not on the ground, but in satellite imagery. The structure was large enough to be visible from space.Further images, including those provided by NASA, showed that the dam did not exist before 1980. That suggests it could be up to 45 years old. Over that time, it grew slowly, piece by piece, shaped by water flow and repeated work rather than a single effort. The location helped keep it hidden. With no nearby access routes, there was little reason for people to pass through.Beavers are often described as ecosystem engineers. They change landscapes by design, even if that design follows instinct rather than a plan. By felling trees and packing wood, mud, stones, and vegetation together, they redirect water and create ponds.In the case of this dam, multiple generations of beavers worked on the same structure. Each added material where it was needed. Over time, the dam expanded and strengthened, holding back runoff from the Birch Mountains at the southern edge of the park. The result is not just a barrier but an entire water system shaped by animals rather than machines.Wood Buffalo National Park is known for more than its size. It supports wood bison, whooping cranes, and the Peace Athabasca Delta, one of the largest inland freshwater deltas in the world. The beaver dam fits quietly into that setting.It supports wetlands, slows water movement, and creates habitat for other species. It does not draw crowds or require fences. It simply exists, doing its work out of sight. Even now, most people will never see it directly. The dam remains where it was built, surrounded by forest and water, changing its corner of the park a little at a time.","The beaver dam is located in Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada.

“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work”

Who was Thomas Alva Edison



What this Thomas Edison quote means



“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.”

Why this quote still matters



How people relate to it today







People remember Thomas A. Edison as one of the most important inventors. He worked on a lot of ideas and had thousands of patents over the course of his life. Many of his inventions are now a part of daily life, like the electric light bulb and sound recording devices. But Edison was known for more than just what he made. People also knew how he thought about work, hard work, and success., is one of the most popular things he has said. Edison talks about a simple habit that a lot of people have. People often look for opportunities in things that seem fun, easy, or rewarding right away. It's easier to ignore something when it looks hard or requires a lot of work. Edison thought this was where a lot of people went wrong. He says that opportunities don't usually come in a polished or attractive way. Instead, it often comes in a quiet way that looks like work that needs to be done.Thomas Alva Edison was born in 1847 in the US. He was curious about how things worked from a young age. As he got older, this curiosity turned into a habit of trying new things and making old ones better. Edison worked on many projects at once and thought that progress came from working hard over and over again instead of getting quick results.Some of the most important things he invented were the electric light bulb, phonograph, and the motion picture camera. He also built labs where groups of people could work together on long-term experiments. Edison thought that being patient, testing things out, and working hard every day were all important parts of coming up with new ideas. A lot of historical records say that he saw innovation as a normal part of his job, not a flash of genius.Edison said,He was using a simple picture to explain a common reaction. Overalls are clothes that people wear to do physical or practical work. Edison used this picture to show that opportunities often seem normal and hard to get.A lot of people think that success will come quickly or with little work. They might want results right away, without having to learn, practice, or fail along the way. Edison said that real opportunities usually require work first and pay off later. Because of this, people sometimes miss out on chances that could have helped them grow.This idea is still important because it shows how people make choices every day. Students might not want to study subjects that need more practice. Workers might not want to do tasks that seem hard. People may put off their personal goals if they seem hard or uncertain. Edison's words remind readers that trying hard doesn't mean you've failed; it usually means that something important is possible.The quote tells people to think about work in a new way. Instead of viewing work as a hindrance, it proposes perceiving it as an integral component of the opportunity.This quote is often used in classrooms, offices, and talks about how to grow as a person. Teachers use it to show how important it is to be consistent. Employers share it to show that hard work pays off in the long run. People think about it when they are deciding whether or not to take on tasks that need a lot of patience.Edison's words still ring true because they describe a reality that many people know. At first, opportunities may not seem appealing, but those who are willing to put in the work often reap the benefits in the end.","Thomas Alva Edison was one of the most important inventors of the 20th century.

Gym syndicate targeted Hindu women for religious conversion in UP; GRP head constable among 6 arrested,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/gym-syndicate-targeted-30-hindus-women-for-religious-conversion/articleshow/127324194.cms,"





LUCKNOW: Police investigation into the gym syndicate that ran an illegal religious conversion and AI-backed blackmail racket in Mirzapur has revealed that the gang targeted as many as 30 women. The gang was busted after two victims blew the lid off.Most of the victims were Hindu women who had joined the chain of five gyms for physical training. The gang targeted women by creating their AI-generated obscene videos and used them to blackmail and pressure them for religious conversion. The racket had been running since 2021, said police.Six accused, including a GRP head constable Irshad Khan, 40, have been arrested.The other five accused include gym owners and trainers — Mohammad Sheikh Ali Alam, 31, Faizal Khan, 34, Zaheer, 32, Shadab, 36, and Farid Ahmed, 28.Obscene AI-edited videos and photos recovered from the mobiles of the accused are a key evidence in the case, said police. The prime accused, gym owner Farid Ahmed, was arrested in an encounter after allegedly opening fire on a police team during a raid.SP/DIG Mirzapur, Somen Barma, told TOI that the racket came to light after two young women lodged separate complaints earlier this month, alleging that they were trapped, blackmailed, and pressured to change their religion using AI-generated obscene videos.Barma said the accused used to befriend women who joined their gyms and gradually gained access to their personal photographs and videos.""These were then morphed using AI tools to create explicit and obscene content. The victims were subsequently threatened with circulation of these AI-edited videos on social media unless they complied with the gang's demands, which included sexual exploitation and coercion to convert religion,"" Barma added.""Recovered mobiles contain dozens of AI-generated obscene videos and chats,"" said another senior officer, adding that most of the accused are Class dropouts.GRP head constable Irshad Khan, posted in Bhadohi, allegedly provided logistical support and protection to the syndicate.Investigators said that 4 of the 5 gyms — KGN-1.0, KGN-2.0, KGN-3.0, B-Fit, and Iron Fire — were run by 3 brothers and their brother-in-law.Mirzapur DM Pawan Kumar Gangwar has sealed all five gyms under the scanner till Feb 27.Police are trying to trace more and find whether the racket had links beyond Mirzapur. Digital forensics teams are analysing data to determine how widely the AI-generated content was shared and whether similar methods were used in other districts.""This was not just a blackmail case. It was a systematic attempt to exploit women psychologically and socially using technology,"" an officer said, adding that more arrests are likely to be made.Authorities have appealed to women who may have been targeted to come forward, assuring them protection and confidentiality.Police said many victims are married and do not want to report the case fearing social stigma and backlash from their families.","Most of the victims were Hindu women who had joined the chain of five gyms for physical training.

Artificial intelligence is no longer something people only argue about in tech conferences or future forecasts. It is already quietly shaping daily life in profound and often unexpected ways. From customer support chats to recommendation engines, from coding tools to medical research, AI is now part of how work gets done efficiently. And according to Bill Gates , the pace of change is about to speed up even more dramatically.In his latest annual letter, The Year Ahead, the Microsoft co-founder lays out a clear message. AI will reshape society, economies, and jobs faster than most people expect. Gates says he remains optimistic about technology, but this time his optimism comes with serious warnings. The benefits are real. So are the risks. And ignoring either would be a grave mistake.Gates has spent decades watching technology alter economies and daily life. In his letter, he says AI is different from past waves of innovation. Not just faster, but broader. He argues that artificial intelligence could affect more parts of society than any previous human-made tool.He points to progress already happening. AI is accelerating disease research, improving climate modelling, and expanding access to digital education.Tasks that once took years can now be completed in months, sometimes weeks. For Gates, this is proof that AI can solve hard problems if used well.But he also stresses that hope alone is not a strategy. Institutions, governments, and workers are not fully prepared for how quickly these changes are arriving. Without planning, the speed of AI adoption could leave many people behind.One of Gates’ biggest concerns is how AI could be misused. As advanced tools become more accessible, the barrier to harmful use drops. He has warned that open-source AI systems could be exploited by bad actors, including non-state groups.In particular, Gates has raised alarms about biological threats. He suggests that AI-assisted misuse could pose risks even greater than naturally occurring pandemics. That is not a casual statement. It reflects a growing fear among researchers that powerful tools, in the wrong hands, could scale harm faster than ever before.Gates argues that global cooperation is essential. Clear rules, oversight, and governance structures are needed. At the same time, he acknowledges the tension. Too many restrictions could slow beneficial innovation. Too little could invite danger. Finding the balance will not be easy.Jobs sit at the centre of Gates’ warning. He says AI makes it possible to produce more goods and services with less human labour. That reality will change how companies hire and how work is valued.Some of this is already visible. In software development, AI tools help programmers write, test, and maintain code faster. Gates notes that developers can now be significantly more productive, which lowers costs and reshapes team structures.He also points to sectors like warehouse operations and phone-based customer service. As AI systems improve, these roles are likely to face pressure. Automation will not arrive all at once, but it will arrive steadily.Gates does not frame this as doom. He frames it as a disruption that needs preparation.Beyond job losses, Bill Gates talks about how work itself might change. If AI boosts productivity enough, shorter workweeks could become possible. The same output, fewer hours. It sounds appealing. But he is careful not to present it as automatic.Whether these gains benefit most people depends on policy choices. Who owns the productivity gains. How companies share them. Without thoughtful decisions, Gates warns that efficiency could concentrate wealth instead of spreading it.This is where governments and institutions matter. AI alone will not deliver fairness. People have to decide what to do with the gains it creates.","Bill Gates says AI will reshape society, economies, and jobs faster than most people expect.

Some players will feel close almost immediately; others not at all. The grid fills, colours appear, and confidence shifts with every line. For anyone stuck midway through, a small nudge can help without giving the game away.Wordle challenges players to uncover a hidden five-letter word in six attempts. After each guess, tiles change colour to show how close you are.Using this feedback to refine each new guess is the core of the game.If today’s puzzle is proving stubborn, these clues focus on structure rather than spelling.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Ensuring children only use apps and games suited for their specific age group.



Utilizing parental control tools to block access to adult or harmful materials.



Preventing children from sharing sensitive personal data or the private information of others.



Reporting any digital threats or grooming attempts to the relevant UAE authorities immediately.

Fines for neglect



Looking ahead





In a groundbreaking move to protect the youngest members of society, the UAE has officially enacted the Child Digital Safety Law, a regulation that shifts the focus of online safety from tech companies directly to the home.Under this new legal framework, parents and legal guardians are now held legally accountable for the digital footprints and online activities of their children. This isn't just a set of guidelines; it is a formal recognition that the virtual world is as significant as the physical one.The United Arab Emirates has issued a new Federal Decree-Law on Child Digital Safety aimed at protecting children from online risks and harmful digital experiences. This law took effect on January 1, 2026 and represents one of the most comprehensive approaches to child online protection in the region. It applies not only to digital platforms but also to parents, caregivers and internet service providers.The move is part of the UAE’s broader strategy to make 2026 the “Year of the Family”, putting children’s well-being at the centre of digital policy and safety initiatives. The law outlines specific ""Digital Due Diligence"" that parents are expected to follow.It moves beyond simply checking a child's browser history and enters the realm of active prevention.Guardians are now required to ensure that children are not accessing age-inappropriate platforms, particularly social media apps that have strict 13+ or 16+ age limits. Parents must monitor for signs of cyber-harassment and take immediate action if their child is being targeted or, conversely, if their child is engaging in bullying behavior toward others.Key responsibilities under the new law include:Under the Federal Decree-Law No. 26 of 2025 on Child Digital Safety, the UAE has established a strict penalty structure to ensure that the ""Digital Due Diligence"" is taken seriously. While the law is currently in a grace period for full operational compliance, the legal framework for fines is already clear.Parents and guardians found in significant breach of their monitoring duties, such as allowing children under 13 to bypass age restrictions or ignoring evidence of digital grooming, face administrative fines that typically begin at AED 5,000 for initial instances of neglect.For more severe cases, the law integrates with the existing Wadeema Law, where ""digital abandonment"" can lead to much steeper financial hits. If a child’s safety is directly compromised due to a lack of parental oversight, fines can reach up to AED 50,000 to AED 100,000.Furthermore, repeat offenders or those who intentionally facilitate a child's access to harmful content may see these amounts doubled. Beyond just the money, the law empowers courts to mandate ""digital rehabilitation"" courses for parents, ensuring they gain the technical skills needed to protect their families moving forward.Staying on the right side of the law begins with activating parental controls across all home devices and ensuring that your children only access age-appropriate platforms, strictly avoiding the ""under-13"" social media trap. Make it a habit to perform a weekly digital check-in to monitor for signs of cyberbullying or contact from strangers, and always utilize the Safe Use filters provided by your UAE internet service provider.Most importantly, foster an environment of open communication where your children feel safe reporting suspicious activity, ensuring that your home remains a sanctuary of ""Mindful Digital Citizenship"" rather than a source of legal liability.","The United Arab Emirates has issued a new Federal Decree-Law on Child Digital Safety aimed at protecting children from online risks and harmful digital experiences. This law took effect on January 1, 2026 and represents one of the most comprehensive approaches to child online protection in the region. It applies not only to digital platforms but also to parents, caregivers and internet service providers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127172705,imgsize-35022,width-400,resizemode-4/uae-digital-law.jpg"

Outdoor loudspeakers restricted to Adhan and Iqama





Circular outlines Ramadan mosque preparations





Iftar arrangements and facility readiness









As Ramadan approaches, Saudi authorities have reaffirmed strict rules governing mosque operations, with a renewed focus on sound discipline, prayer timing, and preparations for worshippers. The measures are intended to preserve the sanctity of prayers while ensuring comfort, order, and consideration for surrounding communities during the holy month.Minister of Islamic Affairs, Call and Guidance Sheikh Abdullatif Al-Sheikh confirmed that mosques across the Kingdom will not be allowed to use external loudspeakers during prayers throughout Ramadan. He clarified that outdoor speakers may be used only for the Adhan, the call to prayer, and the iqama, the second call that signals the start of congregational worship.The restriction applies to all prayers during the fasting month and is aimed at maintaining calm during worship, while limiting noise beyond mosque premises.The announcement followed the release of a circular by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Call and Guidance on Tuesday, setting out detailed instructions for mosque readiness ahead of Ramadan.The circular stressed strict adherence to official prayer times in accordance with the Umm Al-Qura calendar.It specifically highlighted the importance of calling the Isha prayer at its designated time and observing the prescribed duration between the Adhan and the iqama for each prayer.Mosques were instructed to organise iftar meals only in designated courtyard areas. The ministry also emphasised the responsible management of water donations to meet mosque requirements, while discouraging the accumulation of large quantities in storage facilities.Relevant departments were directed to strengthen the work of mosque caretakers and maintenance teams to ensure that facilities are clean, safe, and fully prepared for Ramadan. Particular attention was placed on women’s prayer areas, which the ministry said must receive the same level of care and readiness as other sections of mosques.According to the ministry, the guidelines are designed to ensure that worshippers experience a high level of organisation and care throughout Ramadan. Officials said the measures aim to create a calm, orderly, and spiritually enriching environment inside mosques, while also maintaining respect for nearby residential areas during one of the busiest periods of the Islamic calendar.","Saudi authorities have reaffirmed strict rules governing mosque operations.

Is it really going to rain?

Road safety alerts

Stay Updated: Monitor the NCM’s ""Red"" and ""Yellow"" alerts before heading out on long drives.

Drive Cautiously: Be prepared for sudden fog patches on major highways like E11 and E311.

Outdoor Prep: If you’re planning a desert camp, ensure your gear is moisture-resistant to handle the damp morning air.





After weeks of clear, dry skies, the UAE is bracing for a change in pace as a weak low-pressure system moves in from the east.According to the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM), residents can expect a shift toward more unsettled conditions starting Friday, January 23, 2026.While the weather today remains fair to partly cloudy, a layer of cloud cover is gradually building up, signaling the arrival of a more humid and ""unpredictable"" stretch of the winter season.This atmospheric disturbance, influenced by a similar weak system in the upper atmosphere, means the desert's typical golden sunshine will be shared with patches of grey.While no severe storms are on the horizon, the pattern brings a welcome variety to the season, making it the perfect time to enjoy the outdoors before the humidity levels spike overnight.If you’ve been waiting for a reason to use your umbrella, the weeknd might provide a light opportunity. The NCM has indicated that cloud cover will increase further by Saturday night and Sunday, particularly over coastal and northern areas.There is a tangible chance of light rainfall during this period, especially over the islands and coastal regions.Temperatures are varying significantly depending on where you are in the country.Coastal areas like Dubai and Abu Dhabi are seeing pleasant highs of 19°C to 24°C, while internal regions might hit 25°C.However, the real ""winter"" is happening in the mountains, where daytime temperatures struggle to pass 16°C and nighttime lows have been recorded as low as 5°C to 9°C.Earlier this week, Jebel Jais even recorded a seasonal low of 0.2°C, proving that the UAE's winter ""nip"" is very real.Yes, but rainfall today is more likely to be light rather than heavy. The NCM’s forecast indicates that scattered showers might develop, especially over northern emirates and along the coast.In recent days, light rain has already been observed in parts of the country, and temperatures dipped slightly, a pattern consistent with weak cloud systems passing through.This does not currently suggest widespread storms or heavy downpours, just a gentle wetting rain that may interrupt outdoor plans briefly.One of the most immediate impacts of this weather shift is the rising humidity.Forecasters expect humidity to surge overnight and into Saturday morning, particularly in western areas.This increase often leads to mist or fog formation during the early hours, which can significantly reduce visibility for morning commuters.To ensure a safe weekend, residents are encouraged to:This change in weather serves as a reminder of the unique beauty of a UAE winter. For many, the arrival of clouds and light drizzle is a celebrated event, signaling the peak of ""Karak tea season"" and outdoor gatherings.While the seas remain generally calm to moderate in the Arabian Gulf, the refreshing winds, reaching up to 35 km/h, add a crisp feel to the air.Whether the rain hits your neighborhood or just teases from the clouds, it’s a time to wrap up warm and enjoy the rarest of desert sights: a rainy day in the Emirates.","The UAE is bracing for a change in pace as a weak low-pressure system moves in from the east.

Reality behind the snow





Imagine waking up, looking out your window in Dubai, and seeing the Burj Khalifa draped in a blanket of fresh, powdery snow. That was the dream His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence (lovingly known as Fazza), shared with his millions of followers this Thursday.His Highness, who is basically Dubai’s unofficial ""Chief Storyteller,"" posted a viral image that looked like a scene straight out of a Disney movie, except the ""Castle"" was a world-famous skyscraper.While the photo was a creative ""what if,"" it perfectly captured the mood of a city currently obsessed with the cold. The caption by His Highness, “how the weather will feel tomorrow,” was a cheeky nod to the freezing winds currently whistling through the city's glass towers.While we aren't exactly skiing down Sheikh Zayed Road just yet, the ""Real Feel"" temperature in the UAE is getting pretty close to the vision shared by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan. This week, the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) reported that the mercury hit a bone-chilling 0.2°C on Jebel Jais.For a city built for 45°C summers, this cold snap has changed the way we live:The viral image itself is a masterclass in digital art, likely utilizing AI or high-level editing to show the world what Dubai would look like as a Nordic capital.It’s part of a larger trend where His Highness Sheikh Hamdan uses his platform to highlight the beauty and seasonal shifts of the city in a fun, relatable way.However, the weather scientists at the NCM remind us that while the photo is a fantasy, the Siberian High Pressure system is very real. These winds are pushing clouds across the country and keeping the sun from heating up the desert floor, making this one of the most sustained cold periods the UAE has seen in years.

Why hundreds of bald eagles are flocking to northern British Columbia’s frozen mountains during winter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/why-hundreds-of-bald-eagles-are-flocking-to-northern-british-columbias-frozen-mountains-during-winter/articleshow/126672217.cms,"Source: X

Why British Columbia’s winter landscapes draw bald eagles together



Bald eagles and rare winter group behaviour



What winter eagle gatherings reveal to scientists







In the frozen mountains of northern British Columbia, there was the unusual occurrence of a rare incident in the wildlife scene where the bald eagles were gathered in their hundreds in one spot, and in the middle of winter. Against the background of mountains laden with snow and the icy river valley, the sight was quite outstanding and unusual. For bald eagles, which stand out in their status as symbols of freedom, power, and dominance in nature, it was highly unusual for them to congregate in such huge numbers because they were predominantly lone animals and territorial in their behaviour patterns. The severity of the weather seemed to have had a huge effect on the eagles, as only limited spaces were available and where their feeds were still accessible, forcing unprecedented gatherings that stunned researchers and local communities alike. Such rare congregations offer scientists valuable insight into how climate stress reshapes wildlife behaviour and survival strategies.The northern area of British Columbia is important to the wintering survival of bald eagles. Though much of this area will freeze, there will always be fast-moving rivers that are partially open, providing the eagles with readily available fish. Rivers that support salmon are usually connected, forming pathways to life-sustaining riverways.As winter approaches and the temperature cools, bald eagles from an increasingly vast area will migrate to these feeding grounds, and many will be seen in one small area.The harsh environment imposed by winter causes a shift in bald eagles' normal habits. The immobility brought by snow, the uninhabitability of lakes due to ice, and the shorter daylight hours make energy conservation essential. The habit of securing territories disappears, with eagles seeking locations close to food sources. The movement of prey through the snow-covered environment is predictable, helping the eagles modify their hunting patterns. What seems like a rare concentration of birds is, in actual fact, a decision based on survival that is influenced by the environment.In areas outside breeding colonies or feeding grounds, however, bald eagles tend to be alone. Adults do not compete with each other, particularly around feeding areas. To witness so many of them assemble at one place is a clear indication that their social norms have been temporarily overlooked. Experts say that it is possible only in areas where food is plentiful and accessible. In such areas, even though competition may be a disadvantage, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to observe their flexibility in handling their socialisation.The group behaviours exhibited during winter are very advantageous in several ways. The eagles can view each other in search of food, thus saving time looking for it in the frozen land. Additionally, the dominant eagles will either jump over the ice or find a source of food first as an indirect means of providing for the rest of the group members. The younger and weaker eagles are able to get protection by staying in a group, thus minimising the chances of starvation.Large winter gatherings offer a unique opportunity to study bald eagles under environmental stress. Scientists are able to estimate population size, age structure, feeding patterns, and social tolerance. It helps them to get an idea about the resiliency of the species towards extreme weather and habitat pressure. This kind of data is very crucial in view of changing climatic cycles that disturb food availability and migration behaviour in an ecosystem.The sight of hundreds of eagles in one place often plays the role of a sign of ecological vigour: healthy fish populations, undisrupted waterways, and preserved forest habitats. These aggregations are the natural barometers by which environmental health is spotlighted, emphasising those areas where ecosystems are healthy and working. Such observations also guide conservation planning, policy decisions, habitat restoration priorities, and long-term monitoring strategies across regions facing climate variability.","The sight of hundreds of bald eagles in one place is a sign of ecological vigour.

Russia’s Kamchatka disappears under 7 feet of snow after weeks of relentless storms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/russias-kamchatka-disappears-under-7-feet-of-snow-after-weeks-of-relentless-storms/articleshow/127157141.cms,"Russia’s Kamchatka disappears under 7 feet of snow after weeks of relentless storms (AI-generated)

Weather patterns drive prolonged winter conditions

Satellite imagery reveals the scale of accumulation

Kamchatka’s geography amplifies winter extremes





Following weeks of severe winter weather, snow has covered a sizable portion of the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia. In December and January, there were frequent storms and extended periods of cold that gradually spread throughout towns, roads, and open spaces. According to local sources, snowfall has reached levels not seen in decades, piling several meters in a little amount of time. This winter, high-altitude wind shifts have caused instability in the broader atmosphere, affecting weather well beyond the Arctic. Although Kamchatka is accustomed to harsh seasons, this one has persisted. The peninsula's volcanic environment is now mostly covered by snow, according to satellite pictures, leaving populations to adapt while conditions continue to shift slowly.In Petropavlovsk Kamchatsky, daily movement became difficult as snow continued to fall and settle. Roads narrowed. Cars disappeared beneath drifts. Entrances to buildings were blocked, sometimes more than once. Public transport stopped and restarted in fits. Residents spoke of short walks becoming longer tasks. Emergency crews focused on keeping key routes open, though progress was uneven. In some areas, snow rose to the height of lower windows.The weight of it was gradual rather than sudden, with each storm adding to what was already there, leaving little chance for clearing to catch up.NASA points to changes greater in the atmosphere earlier in the season. A sudden warming event near the Arctic weakened the polar vortex, allowing cold air to move more freely. The jet stream became less stable, bending and shifting in ways that favoured repeated storms. Kamchatka sits where cold northern air can meet moisture from the Pacific. When that balance holds, snowfall can persist. This winter, the pattern did not break quickly. Instead, it returned again and again, keeping temperatures low and snow falling longer than expected.Mid January images from NASA ’s Aqua satellite show fresh snow across Kamchatka’s mountains and valleys. Volcanic peaks appear as pale circles against darker terrain, a familiar shape but more widely covered than usual. Avacha Bay remains open water, shaped by deeper ocean currents, while the land around it stays buried. Scientists use these images to confirm surface reports and track how snow spreads and holds. The pictures do not explain everything. They simply show how much has settled, and how little has shifted.The peninsula’s steep mountains rise quickly from the coast, shaping how storms behave. Moist air lifts, cools, and releases snow as it moves inland. Storms often intensify as they cross the terrain, dropping heavier snow before reaching towns. Residents are familiar with this rhythm. Still, records suggest the recent totals compare with winters from the 1970s. Such seasons place quiet pressure on housing, transport, and power systems. For now, the snow remains, and daily life continues to work around it rather than through it.","7 feet of snow brings Kamchatka to a standstill after weeks of relentless storms.

What happens to coral reefs underneath

These waters matter for marine life

Artificial islands change water movement

Can the environmental impact be undone

What remains beneath the surface





The idea of constructing an island in the middle of the ocean is not new. Decades ago, cities like Miami and San Francisco reshaped their shallow waters to extend their beaches. However, large-scale island building has been occurring farther away from any shore in recent years. Submerged reefs in the South China Sea have become permanent artificial islands due to widespread land reclamation. Although shipping routes and infrastructure are frequently mentioned in relation to these projects, their environmental impact is not as well-known. The Spratly Islands are located in one of the world's most biologically diverse oceanic environments. Here, seafloor landscapes that took thousands of years to build have been changed by construction activities. Marine biologists caution that more significant ecological harm below the surface may be indicated by the physical alterations that are now apparent from satellites.Creating land in the middle of the sea requires enormous quantities of material. Dredging ships scrape sand, coral and sediment from the seabed, often from nearby reefs and lagoons. This material is then pumped onto shallow features until they rise above the waterlineThe process stirs up fine sediment, which can drift for kilometres.Suspended particles reduce sunlight penetration, making it harder for corals and seagrasses to survive. Once settled, the sediment can smother living reefs, blocking the flow of water and oxygen.Coral reefs are not just rocks. They are living structures built slowly by coral animals over centuries. When reefs are buried under sand and concrete, the organisms that form them die. In the Spratly Islands, reefs support a wide range of species, from small reef fish to larger predators. They also serve as nursery grounds for larvae that replenish fisheries across the South China Sea. Damage to these reefs affects ecosystems far beyond the immediate construction sites. Marine biologists say that once a reef is destroyed at this scale, recovery is unlikely within any human timeframe.The South China Sea contains some of the highest marine biodiversity in the world. Its reefs, seagrass beds and open waters support endangered species including sea turtles, sharks and giant clams. Many coastal communities around the region depend on these ecosystems for food. Fish stocks that spawn or feed around the Spratly reefs supply fisheries hundreds of kilometres away. Disrupting these habitats can weaken already stressed fish populations. Scientists note that environmental damage in shared waters rarely stays local.Natural reefs shape currents and waves in subtle ways. When they are replaced with solid land and concrete walls, water flow changes. Altered currents can increase erosion in some areas while causing sediment build up in others. This can affect nearby reefs that were not directly dredged. Changes in wave patterns may also influence how nutrients and larvae move through the region. These secondary effects are difficult to predict and even harder to reverse.Experts generally agree that the damage caused by large-scale reef burial is permanent. Unlike oil spills or surface pollution, the physical destruction of reef structures gives little opportunity for recovery. Some artificial islands have features like restricted green space or energy installations. These do not replenish depleted ecosystems. Coral restoration efforts do exist, but they are on a limited scale and require stable, undisturbed circumstances. In significantly disturbed environments, marine life frequently shifts rather than returns.From above, reclaimed islands appear solid and orderly. Below the waterline, the picture is less clear. Broken reef fragments, altered seabeds and disrupted habitats tell a quieter story. Marine scientists continue to study the long-term effects, though access to some sites is limited. What is already evident is that island building in sensitive waters carries costs that extend well beyond the visible shoreline.Information is based on a publication of Earth Island Institute",China’s island-building over the past decade has reshaped the seabed.

How the Darb toll system really works in the UAE



You must register your vehicle with the Darb toll management system to receive legitimate alerts about unpaid tolls or fines.

Registered vehicles are monitored automatically; toll charges are debited from your account or wallet within the official app or platform.

Official Darb alerts always appear via the app or authorised government SMS services, not from foreign or unrecognised numbers.

Tips to protect yourself from toll scams



Ignore Unknown Toll Alerts - If the toll message comes from an unfamiliar number or contains an unusual link, do not click it, even if the amount looks small. Check Your Payments Directly - Open the Darb app or visit the official website to see if there are legitimate pending charges or fines. Don’t Reply to Suspicious Messages - Responding to scam texts, even with “Y” as instructed, can trigger further scam activity or lead to phishing. Report Scam Messages - Forward the suspicious message to your carrier or mark it as spam; consider notifying local authorities or Q Mobility support. Learn Scam Signs - Scammers often use international numbers, grammar errors, URLs that resemble official domains but differ slightly, and urgent language warning of fines.

Fake Messages Sent by Darb Toll Scammers





Motorists across the UAE, especially in Abu Dhabi, have been warned about fraudulent messages lurking in text inboxes that claim to be official Darb toll alerts. These scam notifications say that drivers have pending Darb toll fees and urge them to click on a link or reply “Y” to settle fines quickly. However, authorities say that these are fake messages designed to trick people into clicking malicious links and potentially giving up personal or payment information.Prompted by a spike in user reports and online complaints, transport officials and cybersecurity experts are now sounding the alarm for drivers to remain vigilant and only use authorised government channels to check toll violations or make payments.In recent days, several UAE residents reported receiving SMS messages titled “DARB-Alert” claiming there are pending toll fees, often just a few dirhams and warning that a fine (typically Dh100) and points could be imposed if the fee isn’t paid “today.”The messages often include:However, when investigators looked at these messages, they found red flags:Similar patterns are being discussed across social media threads, with users warning each other not to click the links.One Dubai Reddit user noted the suspicious URL included spelling errors and a non-government “.com” address, something official toll notifications would never use.Q Mobility, the operator of Abu Dhabi’s Darb toll system and part of the Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company (ADQ) has repeatedly warned users to verify any message claiming to be from them. According to a recent social media post from the company, the only trusted channels for toll alerts and payments are:Q Mobility stressed that official notifications clearly identify themselves and never request responses like “Reply Y.” They also do not include unofficial URLs.Cyber scams of this kind are part of a broader trend of phishing and fake alert campaigns targeting UAE residents in recent years. Authorities including Abu Dhabi Police have actively run awareness campaigns like the “Be Cautious” initiative to educate the public about online fraud tactics, from deceptive links to phishing phone calls.These scam messages exploit urgency and fear, suggesting fines or legal penalties, to trick people into acting impulsively. That’s a common tactic in digital fraud, and law enforcement agencies caution against clicking unfamiliar links or providing sensitive personal or financial data.Similar warnings have been issued about traffic fine phishing emails in the UAE, where fraudsters use fake police logos and official-looking layouts to dupe people into clicking links to bogus payment pages.Understanding how the toll system functions sheds light on why you should not trust random messages:If you suspect you genuinely owe a toll payment, you should open the Darb app or log in to darb.qmobility.ae directly, not via a link in a text message.Here’s how residents are being advised to stay safe:With digital payments and e-services becoming the norm for tolls, parking and traffic fines, scams that mimic these systems can cause real harm, from financial loss to identity theft. Authorities across the UAE have consistently advised residents to verify all digital communications before acting.Abu Dhabi’s integrated transport technology continues to evolve, including paid parking integration through the Darb app and new traffic regulations to improve road flow and compliance. But the convenience of these services also attracts fraudsters looking to exploit public trust.Staying informed and cautious is essential to avoiding scams and ensuring that digital traffic services work as intended.",UAE drivers warned about fraudulent messages claiming to be official Darb toll alerts. These scam notifications say that drivers have pending toll fees and urge them to click on a link or reply “Y” to settle fines quickly.

Special medical considerations for Ramadan 2026



Bottom line: Opt for a balanced, informed approach this Ramadan 2026







As Ramadan 2026 nears, millions around the world are preparing not only spiritually but physically for a month of dawn-to-sunset fasting. While fasting is a beloved religious observance, health experts emphasise that preparation and smart nutrition are crucial to maintaining wellbeing throughout the month. Combining insights from local doctors and reputable global health organisations, here is a trusted guide to help you fast safely and comfortably.Adequate hydration is one of the most important components of a successful fast. The World Health Organization (WHO) Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office specifically recommends drinking plenty of water (at least around 10 glasses) and eating hydrating foods such as soups and fresh fruits like watermelon and salads during non-fasting hours to compensate for fluids lost during the day. They also advise avoiding caffeinated drinks such as coffee, tea and cola because caffeine increases urination and can lead to dehydration.Cornell Health, the health and wellbeing service of Cornell University, echoes this and adds that one should drink fluids at regular intervals through the night and avoid consuming too much at once, as over-hydration in one go can dilute electrolytes.Skipping the pre-dawn meal (suhoor) can make fasting significantly harder.Nutrition experts from Cornell Health advise that suhoor should include a mix of whole grains, protein, healthy fats and fruits or vegetables to help sustain energy and keep blood sugar stable throughout the long fast. Examples include whole-grain cereals or toast with eggs, yogurt with fruit and nuts, or brown rice with vegetables.The WHO also recommends that suhoor be light but nutritious, particularly for groups who may be more vulnerable during fasting such as elderly adults, adolescents, pregnant or nursing women.Both WHO and international dietary guides emphasise the benefits of starting iftar (the evening meal that breaks the fast) with water and dates, a longstanding tradition rooted in health as well as faith. Dates provide natural sugars and a small energy boost while water immediately begins rehydrating the body after prolonged abstinence.This approach is supported by general Ramadan nutrition advice from organisations such as Fraser Health in Canada, which notes that dates and low-fat milk are a healthy way to break the fast and can help prevent abrupt blood sugar fluctuations that contribute to fatigue.Healthline, a respected medical and nutrition information site, recommends leaning into whole foods rich in fiber, lean proteins and healthy carbohydrates during iftar to replenish nutrients lost during the day and provide lasting energy through the night and into the next fast. Examples include vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, eggs, legumes and dairy.Their registered dietitians also emphasise moderation, eating mindfully at iftar and avoiding heavy, sugary, or high-fat foods that can cause indigestion and fatigue. Starting with water and a small date or fruit before main dishes helps control appetite and prevent overeating.Several health authorities recommend reducing caffeine intake in the week leading up to Ramadan. Research and expert advice from wellness organisations suggest that sudden withdrawal from habitual caffeine can lead to headaches and fatigue, symptoms many people misattribute to fasting itself. Gradually tapering coffee and tea before Ramadan can help your body avoid these issues once fasting begins.Moreover, WHO guidance clearly states avoiding caffeine during suhoor and non-fasting periods because it increases urine output and can exacerbate dehydration, something you want to minimise before long fasting hours.WHO and other health organisations encourage a balanced diet throughout Ramadan, composed of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and sufficient fluids, while limiting deep-fried, processed or high-sugar foods that contribute little nutrition and can lead to discomfort or weight gain.This aligns with Cornell Health’s advice on maintaining good nutrition: including vegetables, whole grains and healthy proteins at both suhoor and iftar to help manage hunger, energy levels, and overall health during the fast.While Ramadan is not usually a time for intense workouts during fasting hours, light movement and gentle exercise in the evening, such as walking or stretching, can support digestion and circulation, according to health advisors. Framing this within a balanced lifestyle helps preserve energy without risking dehydration or exhaustion.Sleep hygiene is also important because altered timetables can disrupt normal sleep cycles during Ramadan. Experts advise aiming for adequate rest (7–8 hours if possible) by incorporating naps and consistent sleeping schedules into your routine, which supports physical recovery throughout the fasting month.International health bodies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and dietetics professionals often emphasise that people with chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease or those on specific medications should consult a healthcare provider before fasting. Adjustments to meal timing, medication schedules and monitoring plans ensure safety and prevent complications.This is particularly relevant for individuals whose medical treatments require food or water intake at specific times and cannot be adjusted without professional supervision.Preparing your body for Ramadan fasting is not just about abstaining from food and drink during daylight hours. It is about planning smartly, hydrating fully, eating nutrient-dense meals and respecting your body’s needs. Strategies backed by the World Health Organization, Cornell Health and other recognised health authorities affirm that with proper preparation, most people can experience a safe, comfortable and fulfilling Ramadan.By following these evidence-based tips, from hydration and meal composition to rest and medical consultation, you can approach the holy month with both spiritual intention and physical wellbeing.",Ramadan 2026: Are You Ready to Fast Safely?

— Dubai Media Office (@DXBMediaOffice) January 18, 2026

In January 2026, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) unveiled a milestone in sustainable transport: the arrival and imminent deployment of Zhongtong electric buses capable of operating up to 280 kilometres on a single charge on urban routes. This development, part of a 735-bus procurement plan that includes 40 electric units, marks one of the largest and most advanced electric public-bus deployments in the UAE to date. It reflects Dubai’s accelerating commitment to zero-emission mobility and its broader climate strategy for 2050.At the heart of this initiative is the Zhongtong electric bus, a 12-metre, custom-designed vehicle tailored to Dubai’s climate and operational conditions. Powered by a 434 kWh battery and supported by 360 kW ABB fast chargers, the buses can cover daily routes without having to return to depots for recharging. That 280 km range on a single charge is a major leap for electric public buses in the region, where high temperatures and intensive daily service patterns have previously limited operational efficiency.This deployment makes Dubai one of the first Gulf cities to run electric buses at this scale, with enhanced range and performance that can sustain an entire day’s worth of urban service before needing replenishment.The Zhongtong buses are not a standalone effort. They form a part of the RTA’s Zero-Emission Public Transport Strategy 2050, which aims to transform Dubai’s transit network into a fully zero-emission system by mid-century. Under this strategy, the goal is for all public buses, taxis and limousine services to run on electric or hydrogen power by 2050, supporting wider national climate objectives, including climate neutrality and carbon-footprint reduction.","The Zhongtong electric bus is the first of its type to be operated on Dubai’s urban routes.

Check around you before stepping out: Look under seats and door pockets.

Keep essential items in an outward pocket or visible area.

Dubai’s Lost & Found: A model for smart cities







Dubai’s famous taxis are not just fast and reliable, they are also a magnet for forgotten belongings. According to the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), passengers left behind a staggering 104,162 items in taxis across the Emirate during 2025, prompting one of the city’s busiest Lost & Found seasons on record as drivers and the RTA worked to reunite commuters with their lost property.From wallets stuffed with cash to passports and gadgets, the range of forgotten items reflects the hustle of everyday life in Dubai and the efficiency of a system designed to ensure that lost does not have to mean gone forever. Here’s a closer look at what riders forgot most and how Dubai’s smart mobility network brought them back.The lost and found numbers from RTA reveal that Dubai riders were not just leaving behind the occasional umbrella or pair of sunglasses, they were dropping valuable and essential items after rides. Over AED 2 million in cash was handed into the Lost & Found team in 2025, alongside a flood of high-tech devices and personal documents.Here’s a snapshot of what riders left behind:These figures highlight just how often commuters hustle out of taxis without double-checking pockets, bags or seat areas, perhaps rushed by work, social plans or caregiving duties. The sheer volume also underscores the importance of Dubai’s lost-item recovery infrastructure.The Dubai RTA did not just log these reports; it made getting items back surprisingly smooth for riders. RTA’s system is built around swift communication, detailed tracking and cooperation between call center teams, drivers and taxi companies, often resulting in a recovery within two hours of the initial report.Meera Al Shaikh, Director of Customer Happiness at the RTA, explained that the lost property framework strengthens trust in Dubai’s mobility ecosystem, raising satisfaction not just for journeys but for what passengers take with them afterward.The reporting process itself is multilingual and highly accessible. Passengers can report lost items through:Services are offered in Arabic, English, Hindi, Filipino, French, Chinese, Russian and more, reflecting Dubai’s highly diverse population and making it easy for tourists, residents and workers alike to submit a lost item claim with minimal friction.Being distracted, juggling bags or stepping out in a hurry are everyday occurrences but in a city like Dubai, where taxi trips can be short and frequent, these moments add up to a significant number of forgotten belongings. Unlike many other global cities where lost items may never be reunited with their owners, Dubai’s approach has become a benchmark for urban mobility services.However, it is not just about numbers. The system empowers riders to reclaim valuables quickly and securely. Identity verification protects passengers’ privacy and integrated tracking technologies ensure swift communication with drivers once an item is reported.The RTA’s Lost & Found team reported over 30 messages of gratitude from riders in 2025 alone, a small but telling indicator of how these efforts improve everyday life for commuters across the city.Even with an efficient recovery system in place, prevention is always better than reclamation. Common taxi riders in Dubai and beyond often leave behind items like smartphones, wallets and keys simply because they’re thinking about their next stop. Research from ride-hailing lost property indexes elsewhere suggests items like glasses, bags and even wedding rings sometimes get left behind when commuters rush between meetings or errands.Here are practical tips to reduce that “oops” moment:What if something does get left behind? Filing a report via the RTA call centre or app quickly is the best way to get that item back while the taxi is still nearby.Dubai’s experience with lost items in taxis is not just about forgetfulness, it is a testament to how smart city infrastructure, responsive government services and community cooperation can turn everyday problems into positive outcomes. Where some cities struggle to reunite lost property with owners, Dubai’s integrated approach, supported by multicultural service channels and tech-enabled systems, sets a high bar.Indeed, the success of the lost property framework complements other facets of Dubai’s transportation vision, which includes expanding digital taxi fleets and enhancing connectivity for residents and visitors alike. Whether it is reconnecting a commuter with their passport or returning a laptop they thought was long gone, Dubai’s taxi Lost & Found system is proving that a seamless urban experience includes confidence that what you leave behind can often be found again, fast, safe and with a smile.","Dubai riders left behind 104,162 items in taxis during 2025, prompting one of the city’s busiest Lost & Found seasons on record.

Dubai issues warning over illegal parking deals in Discovery Gardens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-issues-warning-over-illegal-parking-deals-in-discovery-gardens/articleshow/126706296.cms,"Discovery Gardens introduces paid parking in Dubai, warns residents against unofficial rentals / Image: file

Official warning

Permit rules and fees

Delays and app challenges





Dubai’s Discovery Gardens community has introduced a regulated paid parking system aimed at managing the growing number of vehicles and reducing congestion. This change, effective from January 15, 2026, makes on-street parking a paid service, with licence zone signs now in place across the neighbourhood. Residents must apply for parking permits through the official Parkonic system rather than relying on informal arrangements.Each residential unit in buildings without dedicated parking receives one free permit for a vehicle. Additional cars require a paid subscription, typically Dh945 per month or Dh2,625 quarterly, as part of the effort to ensure fair usage and open up street spaces for legitimate residents.In response to posts on community social media pages offering private parking spaces for rent, Parkonic has cautioned residents against unofficial deals. These offers, circulating on platforms like Facebook, involve tenants advertising outdoor parking spaces in exchange for monthly fees.Parkonic emphasised that all valid parking permits can only be obtained through its official app or authorised channels.Payments and registrations made outside the recognised platforms are not supported, and vehicles using such informal arrangements may face regular visitor parking charges or be considered unauthorised, potentially leading to fines or penalties.This advisory aims to protect residents from possible scams and confusion, and to ensure all parking entitlements remain traceable and enforceable under Dubai community rules.The new parking rules have sparked mixed reactions among tenants across the community. Some argue that the fees for second vehicles are too high, especially for families with more than one car, calling for reductions to Dh500-Dh600 or other concessions to ease the burden.There have also been specific concerns from residents of the Zen Cluster (Pink Buildings), a part of Discovery Gardens where only certain apartments have basement parking. A recent circular clarified that on-street parking is excluded from complimentary permit eligibility if a residential unit already has basement parking access, meaning many studio tenants now face visitor tariffs instead of free permits.Residents in this cluster say the lack of free street permits unfairly penalises them and are pushing for equal treatment with tenants in other parts of the community.The transition hasn’t been without hiccups. Parkonic extended the registration deadline to January 19 after numerous residents reported difficulties using the Parkonic app, such as system errors and inability to activate permits even after receiving PINs.To address these issues, Parkonic pledged that residents will not face fines while technical problems persist and that support teams are working to resolve account and activation challenges. This temporary extension has helped more tenants complete the permit process without penalty.Overall, the introduction of paid and regulated parking in Discovery Gardens represents a broader trend in Dubai to standardise parking across communities and reduce misuse by non-residents or long-term street storage. The system aims to free up spaces, reduce traffic problems and prioritise residents, but it also highlights the need for clear communication and flexibility as lived realities catch up with policy.As implementation continues, resident feedback will likely shape future adjustments, especially around fee levels, eligibility criteria, and enforcement practices.",Dubai’s Discovery Gardens community has introduced a regulated paid parking system aimed at managing the growing number of vehicles.

Coup In Britain? Starmer’s ‘Own Cabinet Plots’ His Downfall | ‘Full Bunker Mode’ In No. 10





The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true. ""The UK is set to introduce a nationwide curfew, beginning at 11pm each night,"" he appears to say on one of thousands of TikTok videos of him posted in last six months. ""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok. By Dec 19, most appeared to have been removed from the platform. Howard said the use of AI in politics is increasing rapidly. ""We know it's internationally pervasive now,"" he said. ""Four of every five elections around the world now have AI-generated political junk that is unattributed and clearly misleading.

Govt Sends Notice To Elon Musk's X On Grok AI Chatbot Misuse, IT Ministry Seeks Action Report





Elon Musk’s AI chatbot, Grok, created and then publicly shared at least 1.8 million sexualised images of women, according to separate estimates of X data by the New York Times and the Center for Countering Digital Hate.Starting in late Dec, users on the social media platform inundated the chatbot’s X account with requests to alter real photos of women and children to remove their clothes, put them in bikinis and pose them in sexual positions, prompting a global outcry from victims and regulators.In just nine days, Grok posted more than 4.4 million images. A review by NYT conservatively estimated that at least 41% of posts, or 1.8 million, most likely contained sexualised imagery of women. A broader analysis by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, using a statistical model, estimated that 65%, or over three million, contained sexualised imagery of men, women or kids.The findings show how quickly Grok spread disturbing images, which earlier prompted govts in Britain, India, Malaysia and the US to start investigations into whether the images violated local laws. “This is industrial-scale abuse of women and girls,” said Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which conducts research on online hate and disinformation.“There have been nudifying tools, but they have never had the distribution, ease of use or the integration into a large platform that Elon Musk did with Grok. ”X and Musk’s AI start-up, xAI, which owns X and makes Grok, did not respond to requests for comment. The interest in Grok’s image-editing abilities exploded on Dec 31, when Musk shared a photo generated by the chatbot of himself in a bikini, as well as a SpaceX rocket with a woman’s undressed body superimposed on top. The chatbot has a public account on X, where users can ask it questions or request alterations to images. Users flocked to the social media site, in many cases asking Grok to remove clothing in images of women and kids, after which the bot publicly posted the AI-generated images.On Jan 8, X limited Grok’s AI image creation to users who pay for some premium features, significantly reducing the number of images.Last week, X expanded those guardrails, saying it would no longer allow anyone to prompt Grok’s X account for “images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis.” Since then, Grok has largely ignored requests to dress women in bikinis, but has created images of them in leotards.

A Kansas City man is facing major legal trouble after prosecutors accused him of running a Facebook Marketplace scam in which vehicles were sold to multiple buyers and then stolen back within a day. Authorities say Mamadou Diallo used forged paperwork to make the deals look legitimate, convincing victims to hand over thousands of dollars before the cars disappeared from their driveways. The case has gone viral online, with many reacting in disbelief at how the same pattern reportedly played out again and again across at least eight separate sales.Police reports say the seller listed cars for sale on Facebook Marketplace and met buyers in person to complete the transactions. Buyers believed they were purchasing legally owned vehicles after being given documents that appeared to include valid titles and bills of sale.Within hours, and often within 24 hours, the vehicles were reported stolen, leaving the new owners with no car and no money back.Investigators say the cases followed a repeated pattern across multiple transactions. Buyers purchased either a 2013 grey Honda Civic or a 2013 brown Buick Verano, only for the same vehicle to show up again in another sale soon after.In one reported case, a car was taken back in as little as seven hours, with a theft captured on home CCTV during the early morning.Diallo now faces 14 felony counts, including:If convicted on all counts, he could face up to 98 years in prison, showing how seriously prosecutors are treating the repeated fraud and vehicle theft accusations.Police records link the incidents to May and June 2025, when Kansas City Police received multiple stolen vehicle reports connected to Facebook Marketplace purchases. Investigators later matched the cases based on similarities in listings, vehicles, and paperwork.The charges were announced in January 2026.The story exploded online after being shared widely on X, drawing millions of views. Many users joked that the scheme sounded like an “infinite money glitch” and compared it to Wall Street-style tactics, while others questioned whether the possible sentence is too harsh for a non-violent crime.The case has renewed concerns about the risks of peer-to-peer online sales, especially when large amounts of money exchange hands quickly. Unlike dealership purchases, private sales rely heavily on trust and paperwork, and forged documents can be difficult to detect on the spot.Experts often recommend buyers take extra precautions before paying for a vehicle, including:The case is now being viewed as a cautionary example of how quickly an online deal can turn into an expensive mistake.","Mamadou Diallo is accused of running a Facebook Marketplace scam in which vehicles were sold to multiple buyers and then stolen back within a day.

Ask Dhirendra: 'How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/mutual-funds/ask-dhirendra-how-do-i-decide-how-much-to-save-and-invest-when-my-income-is-just-about-enough/articleshow/126072787.cms,"The problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough. A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126072870,imgsize-47970,width-400,resizemode-4/saving-and-investing.jpg"

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.
