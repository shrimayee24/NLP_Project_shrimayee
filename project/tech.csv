Dubai, renowned for its opulent skyscrapers like the Burj Khalifa and Princess Tower, epitomises luxury and a high quality of life. Each year, countless individuals flock to this vibrant desert metropolis in search of better opportunities and brighter futures. Yet, the story behind Dubai’s impressive skyline often overlooks the lives of the many labourers who work tirelessly to construct it.A significant portion of these workers come from India, earning daily wages as construction labourers in this bustling city.Recently, a viral video has shed light on the harsh living conditions faced by Dubai’s labourers, igniting widespread outrage. This heartbreaking reality was brought to the forefront by Instagram user Md Rafique, whose video revealed a seldom-seen aspect of Dubai: the overcrowded and inadequate living spaces many workers endure. The viral video reveals the living conditions of many migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, providing internet users with a stark glimpse into their struggles. The footage, which is circulating widely online, has ignited significant debate about the inhumane conditions these workers face.The footage shows a large hall with a tin roof, packed with shabby dormitories stacked closely together. Rows of bunk beds stretch on, illustrating the cramped quarters that thousands of workers call home after long, gruelling days on construction sites.The makeshift accommodations house workers from various countries, including Bangladesh, Pakistan, China, and India. After labouring under the relentless sun, these men return each night to rest in conditions that offer little comfort.The video has struck a chord with viewers, amassing over two million views and sparking discussions about the plight of these labourers. Comments reflect a mix of sympathy and outrage. One viewer lamented, “This is heartbreaking! They deserve so much better for all their hard work.” Another emphasised the need for advocacy for change, while some shared personal experiences, with one recalling, “I worked in Dubai years ago and witnessed this firsthand. It’s time the world knows.”Many have likened the situation to an animal farm. Pranav Roy remarked, “It’s no different than a chicken farm .” Tushar Jalavadiya advised, “You might as well stay in India with your family; no one should have to earn money under such conditions.” Radhika commented, “They claim to earn well in Dubai, but the reality is revealed online.” Ashwani Atwal stated, “It’s nothing more than a jail.”However, not all feedback was negative. Adil Chaudhary pointed out that workers receive a three-hour break during the summer, and that there are air-conditioned rooms and toilets available. He also noted that buses transport workers to and from their living quarters, with a rule that no room can house more than six people in Dubai.Many are calling for greater accountability from the companies employing these workers, with one comment stating, “These companies need to be held responsible for the living conditions of their workers!”","A viral video has shed light on the harsh living conditions faced by Dubai’s labourers.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

How hackers can use Peaklight to infect Windows PCs

The JavaScript then activates a PowerShell script named Peaklight. Downloading more threats: Peaklight acts as a downloader, retrieving additional malware from a remote server. This could include dangerous programs like Lumma Stealer, Hijack Loader, and CryptBot, which can steal user data or give attackers control of the user's computer.

""PEAKLIGHT is an obfuscated PowerShell-based downloader that is part of a multi-stage execution chain that checks for the presence of ZIP archives in hard-coded file paths. If the archives do not exist, the downloader will reach out to a CDN site download the remotely hosted archive file and save it to disk.”

A new type of malware called Peaklight is targeting people who download movies from illegal sites. This ""next-stage"" malware aims to infect Windows computers, ultimately deploying information stealers and loaders. Security researchers at Google's cybersecurity company Mandiant have warned that visiting illegal movie sites carries significant risks, including legal consequences and exposure to malware like Peaklight.In a blog post, Mandiant claims that Peaklight is a new and stealthy malware that operates entirely within a computer's memory, leaving no trace on the hard drive which makes it difficult to detect. Security researchers claimed that this malware is designed to discreetly download additional harmful software onto infected Windows systems.Mandiant noted.Mandiant explained that Peaklight uses a covert PowerShell script to deploy additional malware onto infected systems. This method facilitates the distribution of harmful programs such as Lumma Stealer , Hijack Loader, and CryptBot. These programs are offered as services for rent, enabling cyber attackers to steal information or take control of compromised computers.As per the report, cybercriminals are spreading the malware through fake movie downloads. For this, hackers are hiding dangerous Windows shortcut files (LNKs) within ZIP folders disguised as popular films.Once opened, the LNK file triggers the following chain reaction:The report noted that the malware was particularly stealthy because it operates entirely within the computer's memory (RAM). This makes it very difficult for traditional antivirus software to detect, as most antivirus programs primarily scan the user’s hard drive for threats.Mandiant researchers Aaron Lee and Praveeth D'Souza said:","A new type of malware called Peaklight is targeting people who download movies from illegal sites.

Meta AI now has capabilities to edit photos

Meta is testing AI-powered translations

Meta AI gets voice

Meta , the parent company of Facebook and Instagram , has announced a suite of generative AI tools for its social media platforms. These tools will empower users to generate and modify images with AI, and even translate videos, opening up new creative possibilities for content creation and engagement.At its annual Meta Connect conference, company CEO Mark Zuckerberg introduced multimodal features to the Llama 3.2 large language models “that make Meta AI and our other AI products more fun, useful and capable.”The company announced that users can also now share photos in chats with Meta AI, and Meta AI can understand the picture, and even answer questions about it.For example, users can share a photo of a flower they saw on a hike and ask Meta AI what kind of flower it is. Or share a photo of a dish and ask Meta AI for instructions on how to cook it.Apart from responding to photos, Meta AI can now help users to edit them. Users can send an image in a chat with Meta AI and tell the chatbot what they want added, removed or changed in the photo – “from changing your outfit to replacing the background with a rainbow”.“And if you want to reshare a photo from feed to your Instagram Story, Meta AI’s new backgrounds feature can take a look at your photo, understand what’s in the image and generate a fun background for the story,” it added.Meta is also testing an AI-powered translation tool that will automatically translate the audio of Reels in different languages.“With automatic dubbing and lip syncing, Meta AI will simulate the speaker’s voice in another language and sync their lips to match,” the company said.Meta is starting with small tests on Instagram and Facebook on videos from Latin America and the US in English and Spanish. The company plans to expand this to more creators and languages.Users can now use their voice to talk to Meta AI on Messenger, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram DM, and it’ll respond out loud. Users will also be able to choose from different voice options for your assistant, including AI voices of Awkwafina, Dame Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan Michael Key and Kristen Bell.The company also claimed Meta AI is on track to become the most-used AI assistant in the world by the end of this year, and that more than 400 million people are using Meta AI monthly, with 185 million people using it across our products each week.","Meta AI can now answer questions about photos and help users edit them.

Cred design head's 'If you were to die...' advice does not go well with the internet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/cred-design-heads-if-you-were-to-die-advice-does-not-go-well-with-the-internet/articleshow/113691207.cms,"What Harish Sivaramakrishnan said: Watch

User reactions

Harish Sivaramakrishnan , the head of design at CRED , a fintech company , has faced online criticism for his advice to product designers . He suggested that they approach their work with the same intensity as if they were to die the next day.In a video from an event shared on LinkedIn, Sivaramakrishnan was seen urging designers to approach their work with the same intensity as if it were their last day.Expressing frustration with the ""slack attitude"" among designers, he emphasised the importance of investing time and effort in their work. Sivaramakrishnan encouraged designers to take pride in their work and avoid rushing through projects. However, his remarks were met with mixed reactions, with most criticising his opinion.In the video, Sivaramakrishnan said, “If you were to die the next day, you should be insanely proud of the detail that you drove into that release. Now the detail you can drive in the release which gives you only like two and a half weeks of sprint time, will not look like a release that you can do in two and a half years. I am aware, you’re aware, so that’s not the point. But there is a general slack attitude which says, ‘Quickly get something done,’ quickly you can’t get anything done. So my point is just to put in that right effort. Write the best copy you can, get the best visual design you can, get the best transition design you can, get the best API optimisation you can. To become that product that you really want, but attitudinally are you a person saying, ‘Quickly kuch bana ke phataphat se test kar dete hain,’ is the worst way to build. I haven’t seen a single product that has worked like that.""Many users found the advice insensitive and inappropriate , especially given the potential for it to trigger negative emotions in those who may be struggling with personal challenges. Here are some user reactions:“On my deathbed, I'd be so worried about how I could have maximised shareholder value more than t hinking about my loved ones . On a lighter note, I sure hope I am not thinking about the details of the products I shipped on my death bed✌️Although I think many of my PRDs may potentially be lethal. For me.”“Love this perspective! Although, if I were to die the very next day, I'd probably be more concerned about finishing my bucket list than the details in my product. But hey, that's just me. Keep up the great work, Harish!”","Harish Sivaramakrishnan is the head of design at CRED, a fintech company.

Across India, companies are embracing the return to the office, with a staggering 96% implementing full or partial in-person work models. But what would you say if I told you that only 1 in 10 workspaces are equipped effectively? Technical errors, glitches, sluggish video, and muffled voices hamper employee's workflow and productivity. Therefore, we must reimagine our collaboration strategies to ensure meetings become well-oiled engines of productivity, driving success in the era of the hybrid workplace.Introducing innovative solutions to our work set-ups will help us stay competitive in the dynamic business landscape while facilitating effortless communication amongst teams.Collectively as a workforce, we spend millions of minutes due to technical meeting issues – and the increase in online meetings since the pandemic hasn’t made it any bit easier. The return to the office has disrupted online meeting habits, necessitating a shift from meeting room usage to accommodate hybrid work interactions. Video solutions are essential, but mastering hybrid meetings requires technology that fosters, not hinders productivity. As per a report on hybrid work reveals that 1/3 of employees struggle with meeting room tech and 50% would choose the laptop at their desks over a video-equipped meeting room. Only 1 in 10 meeting rooms are equipped with video. And even when they are, people aren’t comfortable with using them. Here training on video tech and hybrid meeting etiquette is crucial to bridge the gap and unlock the potential of hybrid meetings. I suggest a two-pronged approach to do this:New tech requires new training. Employees often struggle to manage busy workdays, making it challenging to navigate video solutions before the meeting. So, training sessions are a good way to onboard your employees on to your new meeting room solution. Today, brands are integrating AI to their devices to enhance user experience. So, understanding the tech behind the product may help employees to work smarter and more efficiently. If unfamiliar with in-room technology, remote participants may feel excluded.A simple reminder can go along way as the ultimate motive is to help and support workers in their daily collaboration. I recommend posting a physical instruction guide in the meeting room or a QR code linking to instructions, so it’s easy and quick for the employees to work the room – and the video equipment.While one battle is to get your employees to use your video-equipped meeting rooms , our research reveals that only 15% of office meeting rooms are equipped with video. Therefore, we must redesign and optimize meetings rooms with video to enable better hybrid meeting experiences. Here are the top 5 considerations to be made:Meetings should be equitable for all participants – whether in the room or remote. Ensure the meeting room technology brings remote participants into the room and in-room participants to them.You can’t optimize your meeting rooms if you think of room layout and technology separately. Be sure to consider how the video camera’s field of view is like and how it best captures everyone in the room, when doing the room layout.As already mentioned, ensure that your employees are dressed to impress when it comes to mastering the technology. Equip them with training and guides, so your redesigned meeting rooms aren’t ghosted by your employees.Top-quality technology leads to trust which is typically more difficult to establish remotely than it is in person. As per our LSE study, meeting participants reported much greater levels of overall trust and clarity when utilizing and experiencing professional technology. There was a 27% increase in technology clarity, leading to 16% more trust, 35% greater expressiveness, and a 47% perceived improvement in the quality of input. Organizations must therefore recognize how vital professional technology is for enhancing employee engagement and productivity in hybrid meetings.AI is on the rise. The tech product we rely on for our day-to-day tasks now integrates AI, offering enhanced productivity and unique experiences for the users - from your laptops to your headphones to even your personal tech gadgets. For example – a feature like IntelliFrame offers users multiple video streams, face and voice recognition – revolutionizing meeting experiences. Therefore, it is important that we stay ahead of the curve and adapt to the ever-evolving landscape to prepare ourselves for the future of work.New technology is rarely an easy transition and adoption, but a little effort to smoothen the process can take you far. Leveraging the potential of AI along with choosing the right tech upgrades for your work setup or organization can not only optimize meeting rooms but also improve meetings and meeting efficiency significantly. By ensuring that meeting rooms and employees are equipped for a new era of meetings, businesses can foster an even better work experience for all.","Meetings should be equitable for all participants – whether in the room or remote.

"Mark Zuckerberg reveals $10,000 Orion AR Glasses prototype at Meta Connect",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mark-zuckerberg-reveals-10000-orion-ar-glasses-prototype-at-meta-connect/articleshow/113688259.cms,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled Orion, a prototype of advanced augmented reality (AR) glasses, at the company's annual Connect event. Described as ""the most advanced glasses the world has ever seen,"" Orion represents a significant leap in AR technology , combining a wide field of view with a compact form factor.The Orion glasses feature Micro LED projectors built into the frames, creating a 70-degree field of view holographic display.This allows users to see digital content seamlessly blended with the physical world. Control is achieved through a combination of eye tracking, hand gestures, and a neural interface wristband. The glasses are powered by custom silicon designed by Meta, with components packed down to a fraction of a millimetre.While not yet ready for consumer release, Orion demonstrates Meta's progress in miniaturising AR technology. The glasses are noticeably smaller than competitors like Snap's recently announced Spectacles 5 . However, with current production costs estimated at $10,000 per unit, significant work remains to make Orion commercially viable.Meta is positioning Orion as a successor to its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which have seen surprising success. The company envisions Orion enabling a range of applications, from multitasking with virtual windows to big-screen entertainment and life-size holograms of people.Development of Orion has been ongoing for a decade, with Meta facing numerous technical challenges. The company had initially planned for a 2024 consumer release but shelved those plans in 2022 due to high costs.For now, Meta will use Orion for internal development and external demonstrations while working towards more affordable versions. Zuckerberg expressed optimism about bringing Orion-like glasses to market ""within a few years"" at prices comparable to “current smartphones and laptops,” as noted by The Verge.In addition to Orion, Meta announced several other products at Connect 2024, including a $300 Quest 3S mixed reality headset and updates to its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. The company also showcased advancements in its AI assistant and expanded AR features across its social media platforms.","Orion is a prototype of advanced augmented reality (AR) glasses.

'Who decides that £175 is fair': Concerns raised over soaring ticket prices for England vs India Test at Lord's,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/who-decides-that-175-is-fair-concerns-raised-over-soaring-ticket-prices-for-england-vs-india-test-at-lords/articleshow/113705362.cms,"(Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty Images)

NEW DELHI: Former English cricketer and commentator David Lloyd expressed his concerns about the future of Test cricket , as ticket prices for the upcoming third Test between England and India at Lord's next July have skyrocketed.The cost of tickets has increased, reaching an astonishing £175 (Rs 19,557). Even the most affordable seats available for the first three days come at a steep price of £90 (around Rs 10,000), and unfortunately, these seats offer limited visibility of the event.""Paying that much for a seat where you can't see the entire field is ridiculous.What might you miss? The batsman? A catch down at fine leg?"", Lloyd wrote in his Daily Mail article.""Test cricket is in danger of becoming an event only for the elite. It risks excluding regular fans who can't afford such high prices. Sure, it's fun to spot celebrities in the crowd, but cricket needs to cater to everyone, not just the rich,"" he said.Lloyd suggests that Lord's is a trendsetter for other cricket venues. If the ticket prices at Lord's range from £120 – £175 (around Rs 13,000 -Rs 19,000), it could lead to similar pricing strategies being adopted by other grounds.""But who sets these prices? Who decides that £175 is fair? I'd love to know the answer,"" he added.""At Lord's, stewards collect champagne corks after every over. But, at places like Headingley, try throwing a can of Tetley's over the boundary and see what happens!""""I'm speaking for the everyday fan. The kind who enjoys a football match with a pie and Bovril. For us, paying £120-£175 (for one day of cricket is outrageous. It feels like the MCC knows the price of everything, but the value of nothing. They're risking losing the connection between this great England team and the public."" .""So, the face value cost of attending a single day of a Lord's Test is utterly preposterous to me. The MCC seem to know the price of everything and the value of nothing,"" Lloyd concluded.","Former England cricketer and commentator David Lloyd expressed his concerns about the future of Test cricket.
