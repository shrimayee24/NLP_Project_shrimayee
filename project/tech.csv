NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Qatar’s best view yet: The fastest annual meteor shower arrives Nov 17,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/qatars-best-view-yet-the-fastest-annual-meteor-shower-arrives-nov-17/articleshow/125377745.cms,"Leonid meteors streak across Qatar’s night sky tonight / AI-Generated Image

What are the Leonids?

When to watch?

Where to look for Meteors?

Maximizing your meteor hunt

Moon-Free Skies: The shower peaks when the Moon is in its waning crescent phase, meaning it will be only about 9 percent illuminated. This minimal moonlight translates to significantly darker skies, preventing light pollution from the Moon itself from washing out the fainter meteors.

Find the Dark: The most crucial tip for any meteor shower is to escape city lights. Find a secluded spot far away from all sources of light pollution (such as streetlights and residential areas). Your eyes need complete darkness to adjust fully.

Go Naked-Eye: You do not need any special equipment like telescopes or binoculars; these tools are too zoomed-in to capture the sweeping path of a meteor. All you need are your naked eyes and patience.

Allow Adjustment Time: Once you arrive at your dark location, allow your eyes a minimum of 20 to 30 minutes to fully adjust to the darkness. Any bright phone screen light will immediately reset this process.

Get Comfortable: Bring a comfortable chair or blanket. Meteor viewing is a waiting game, so lie back with your feet pointing generally toward the east/northeast and scan the entire expanse of the sky.





Get ready to ditch the city lights and look up! The celestial event of the month, the Leonid meteor shower, is about to light up the sky, peaking on the night of November 16-17, 2025. These dazzling ""shooting stars"" are renowned as some of the fastest in the cosmos, created as Earth streaks through the dusty trail left by Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle.Because this year features excellent, moon-free conditions and the potential for up to 40 meteors per hour, now is your chance to witness the natural fireworks. Read on for your simple, step-by-step guide on the best time to look up, where to point your gaze, and how to maximize your viewing success.The origin of these meteors is the tiny, dusty trail left behind by Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle. As Earth orbits the Sun each November, it passes directly through this debris field. The specks of dust, most smaller than a grain of sand, vaporize upon atmospheric entry, creating the flash we observe from the ground. While typically producing a modest display, the Leonids are famously known for their meteor storms—intense periods where thousands of meteors can fall per hour, a spectacular event that occurs roughly every 33 years, coinciding with the comet’s orbital period. While 2025 is not a storm year, conditions promise excellent visibility.Astro-observers predict the shower’s peak around 18:00 UTC on 17 November 2025, that converts to 21:00 (9:00 pm) on 17 November in Qatar (UTC+3). Even so, the best practical viewing is after midnight and into the pre-dawn hours, when the Leo radiant climbs higher and more of the sky is favourable. Expect about 10–15 meteors per hour under good, dark skies (some sources give up to ~15–20/hour as a generous peak estimate).The Leonid meteor shower is active annually from around November 6 until November 30, but the best viewing opportunity, the peak, occurs on the night between November 16 and 17, 2025. The absolute ideal time to watch is after midnight until the pre-dawn hours on the morning of November 17, when the meteor shower's radiant point is highest in the sky.The meteors appear to originate from the constellation Leo the Lion (hence the name Leonids), which rises in the east/northeast after midnight. While they seem to stream from Leo, viewers are advised to look 30 to 40 degrees away from the radiant. Looking away from Leo allows you to catch the meteors streaking across a wider section of the sky, maximizing the chance of seeing longer, more dramatic trails.Globally, rates are expected to be around 10 to 15 meteors per hour (ZHR). However, local astronomical experts have suggested the rate could reach up to 40 meteors per hour in exceptionally dark viewing locations, providing the potential for a significantly better display.This year presents a particularly favorable chance to view the Leonids, primarily due to the state of the Moon.As the Leonids sweep across Qatar’s sky on November 17, this is your once-a-year chance to slow down, look up, and enjoy a natural light show that needs nothing more than clear skies and a little patience. Whether you're watching from the desert, the coastline, or your rooftop, the night promises a mix of calm, wonder, and those brief streaks of magic that remind us how alive the sky really is. Enjoy the moment, the Leonids are here, and they’re worth staying up for.","The Leonid meteor shower is active annually from around November 6 until November 30.

Watch video: Dubai makes history with world’s first air taxi take-off - Here the first look,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/watch-video-dubai-makes-history-with-worlds-first-air-taxi-take-off-here-the-first-look/articleshow/125382193.cms,"World’s first crewed air taxi lifts off in Dubai / Image credit: File

Historic first crewed eVTOL flight in Dubai

The aircraft, speeds and where you’ll board?

Qatar’s quiet coup





Dubai has completed its first crewed electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) air-taxi flight, a short point-to-point journey being hailed as a milestone on the road to commercial air-taxi service in 2026.If you want the first visual, the Dubai Media Office video shows the aircraft lifting off at Margham and landing at DWC during the trials; it’s the clearest public footage of the crewed point-to-point run. Expect more test flights, phased certification steps and vertiport roll-outs through 2025–2026, ahead of the first commercial routes planned for 2026.On 16 November 2025, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), in partnership with Joby Aviation, completed the first crewed eVTOL flight between Margham and Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC), a point-to-point test that demonstrates vertical take-off, cruise and landing in an operational context. The RTA and Dubai Media Office released video and statements showing the short crewed journey as part of trials ahead of a planned 2026 launch. Watch the official clip from Dubai Media Office for the moment the aircraft lifted off and landed:[Also read: Dubai unveils 4 launch pads for Flying Taxis: Where you’ll catch the World’s first aerial taxi in 2026 Dubai’s air-taxi programme is built around the Joby Aviation S4 eVTOL, a quiet, all-electric aircraft with six rotors, four battery packs and a performance profile that allows speeds of up to 320 km/h and ranges of around 160 km per charge, making it ideal for fast city hops.Each aircraft will carry four passengers plus one pilot, offering a compact but premium cabin with panoramic windows and low noise levels compared to helicopters.To support the service, the RTA is developing a network of dedicated vertiports, starting with Dubai International Airport (DXB), Palm Jumeirah, Downtown Dubai and Dubai Marina, with the DXB hub already about 60% complete and designed to handle up to 170,000 passengers a year. These strategically chosen points are meant to slash travel times—for example, a 45-minute ground trip could take just 12 minutes by air. Watch the video for a close-up look at what the air taxi offers, inside and out:Although pricing is not final, early estimates suggest fares could sit around US$75, similar to a high-end ride-hailing service, with the long-term aim of becoming competitive with regular taxis. Joby has already completed hundreds of piloted test flights globally and holds exclusive operating rights in Dubai for six years, while passengers will eventually be able to book flights through a dedicated mobile app, with fast charging and quick turnarounds enabling frequent daily operations.Overall, the system is being built as a smooth, airport-style experience, compact vertiports, efficient boarding, pilot-operated flights and seamless links to the metro, buses and taxis, making air taxis feel less like futuristic experiments and more like an everyday transport option.Days before the Dubai spectacle, Qatar secured a different, but equally significant, victory by focusing on full autonomy. On November 15, 2025, the country celebrated the successful trial of its first-ever urban passenger flight with a fully unmanned eVTOL.The event was proudly sponsored and officially witnessed by H.E. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulla bin Mohammed Al Thani, the Minister of Transport (MoT). The aircraft operated entirely without any direct human interference, relying completely on a full self-control system enabled by AI and sophisticated advanced air navigation technologies. Remarkably, the pilotless taxi flew successfully between the Old Doha Port and the scenic Katara Cultural Village.This initiative is a core part of the MoT Strategy 2025-2030, which aims to create a smart, resilient transportation system to support Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV 2030) and reduce the nation's carbon footprint.","Dubai has completed its first crewed electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) air-taxi flight.

Launch and iconic Srk moments

Tower’s spectacular features





Dubai developer Danube Group has launched Shahrukhz by Danube, a premium commercial tower on Sheikh Zayed Road that will carry Shah Rukh Khan ’s name and a life-size statue of the star at its entrance. The project, unveiled at a Mumbai event with Danube founder Rizwan Sajan and Shah Rukh Khan, is positioned as a landmark commercial address and is expected to be completed in the next 3–4 years.Shahrukhz (styled as Shahrukhz by Danube) is being promoted as a premium commercial and lifestyle tower on Sheikh Zayed Road, Dubai’s main business artery. Reports list it as a 55–56 storey development with more than one million sq ft of built-up space, a helipad, over 40 amenities (sky pool, business lounges, valet, etc.), and a life-size statue of Shah Rukh Khan in his signature open-arms pose at the entrance. The builder's marketing and press coverage place the finish date around 2029, a roughly three-to-four-year timeline.The newly unveiled skyscraper is more than just a name; it’s a massive commercial development positioned at a prime location. The building sits directly on Sheikh Zayed Road, Dubai's main arterial corridor. The project carries a gross saleable value of approximately ₹4,000 crore (over $480 million) and will span more than 1 million square feet of built-up space.Marketed as a premium, Grade-A commercial destination, the tower stands 55 or 56 storeys tall.This landmark development is intended to be affordable for new businesses in Dubai, with commercial units starting at around $460,000. Construction is underway, and the developers are targeting a completion date by the second quarter of 2029.Danube Group is one of the UAE’s most recognisable home-grown business success stories, and the company behind the newly announced Shahrukhz tower. The group was founded in 1993 by Rizwan Sajan, an Indian-origin entrepreneur who arrived in Dubai with modest beginnings and grew a small trading shop into a multi-industry powerhouse.Over three decades, Sajan expanded Danube from a building-materials supplier into a diversified conglomerate with operations across the Middle East and Asia. His leadership style is often described as hands-on, ambitious and deeply relationship-driven, which has helped Danube build long-standing trust among suppliers, customers and partners.Today, Danube Group operates several major verticals, including building materials, home interiors, hospitality, façade systems and real estate but its most high-profile public face is Danube Properties, the development arm behind this new Shah Rukh Khan-named tower. Because the company originally started in building materials, Danube has an unusually deep supply-chain advantage in construction, allowing it to manage cost, quality and delivery with tighter control than many competitors.The grand launch event took place not in Dubai, but in Mumbai, hosted by the developers to appeal to Indian investors. Superstar Shah Rukh Khan graced the stage, alongside Danube Chairman Rizwan Sajan and filmmaker Farah Khan. The actor became visibly emotional while reflecting on the milestone, noting that his late mother would have been ""very happy"" about the honour. He shared a personal connection, expressing pride that he could tell his children, ""Papa's name is written here, this is Papa's building. ""In classic SRK style, he entertained the audience by recreating his iconic open-arm pose, performing the ""Don walk,"" and delivering his famous 'Om Shanti Om' dialogue. He also joked about his rare public appearances, quipping, ""I’ve become like the Eid moon. I am rarely seen, but when I appear, I look good."" Khan revealed that he was drawn to the project because it resonated with the idea of supporting people who come to a city with dreams of building their businesses and lives.The ""Shahrukhz by Danube"" tower is designed to be a unique experience, blending luxury commercial space with a tourist attraction dedicated to the star. It will boast more than 40 premium amenities for its occupants. The most distinctive feature will be a life-size statue of Shah Rukh Khan in his signature open-arms pose, located prominently at the entrance.The developers envision this entrance becoming a must-visit tourist destination, much like fans flock outside SRK's Mumbai residence, Mannat. Furthermore, the building’s cutting-edge design includes a helipad and is even expected to feature an air taxi station, a nod to Dubai’s futuristic transit plans. Danube Properties has confirmed that the name ""Shahrukhz"" is guaranteed to remain with this specific tower in perpetuity.","Dubai developer Danube Group has launched Shahrukhz by Danube, a premium commercial tower on Sheikh Zayed Road.

Will Dubai’s 20-minute city vision melt under extreme summer heat? Is there a plan?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/will-dubais-20-minute-city-vision-melt-under-extreme-summer-heat-is-there-a-plan/articleshow/125317772.cms,"Dubai is testing climate-controlled zones and shaded walkways to make its 20-minute city vision viable even during extreme summer heat (Representative Image)





How Expo City is tackling the heat



In winter: Encouraging walking through interactive, engaging spaces

In summer: Introducing climate-adapted solutions such as:



Climate-responsive urban design such as enclosed cool spaces Shaded walking routes Smart mobility hubs for bicycles and e-scooters Electric vehicles to support inclusive and multi-modal mobility



Don’t forget the old neighborhoods



Sustaining the vision: Making 20-minute cities work in the real world

Reduced traffic congestion

Improved quality of life

Lower carbon emissions

Greater walkability and livability





Dubai is pushing forward with its ambitious goal of building “20-minute cities”: neighborhoods where residents can access 80% of their daily needs, such as work, school, shops, and parks, within a 20-minute walk, bike ride, or public transport trip. This urban planning concept is a cornerstone of the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan and is already being realized through projects like the Model District in Al Barsha 2. Currently under construction. The goal is to reduce reliance on private vehicles by building compact, mixed-use communities that encourage local living. This means people will be able to live, work, study, and relax all within a 20-minute radius of their homes.A key metric in the plan is ensuring that 55 percent of Dubai’s residents live within 800 meters of a mass transit station, enabling them to reach 80 percent of their essential destinations with ease. The broader objective is to create smarter urban layouts that promote well-being, cut down on traffic congestion, and make everyday life more convenient for everyone, whether in newly developed areas or eventually in older neighborhoods as well.However, despite the well-thought-out design, one major challenge stands in the way: Dubai’s extreme summer heat.At Expo City Dubai, planners are leading the experimentation with adaptive solutions for year-round mobility, especially during the sweltering summer months.“In the winter, people are encouraged to walk,” explained Ivan Kyselov, Senior Manager of City Operations at Expo City Dubai, during his presentation at Mobility Live, a global event hosted at the venue that brings together experts in smart transport and mobility solutions.“It’s an experience and we promote it by activating the spaces around the walking routes. If you paint something on the pathway, kids will just simply play and walk these 15 minutes. Adults are the same. So we add an interactive element of architecture and urban development as a pit stop,” he added.To enhance accessibility and comfort, Expo City Dubai is adopting a flexible, seasonal approach:Kyselov noted these innovations are essential to maintaining multimodality, inclusivity, and accessibility throughout the year, especially in Dubai’s harsh climate.While new developments like Expo City are important, experts emphasized the importance of upgrading older districts to align with the 20-minute city model.Martin Tillman, a transport mobility planning expert, told Mobility Live attendees that regenerating aging urban areas should be a top priority.“We have to help regenerate the old city,” he said. “It's somewhat easier to go to a new field or site and to say this is how we're going to move forward. It's a little more difficult to go into something that's already existing and work on it because it doesn't have the parking provision or a rail network.”Tillman believes the effort is worth it:“The reward is significant,” he said. “Typically the previously planned cities were planned on the basis of better access for pedestrians and for people cycling. They tended to have better shape and were better coded for the day-to-day realities of living here in the Middle East. I think that's crucial and the idea of leaving that to decay is completely wrong.”With the Dubai 2040 Master Plan already underway, and projects like the Al Barsha 2 Model District and Expo City setting examples, the emirate is clearly committed to evolving its urban fabric.The idea of 20-minute cities offers:But success depends heavily on addressing climate realities, particularly by incorporating climate-controlled zones and adaptive infrastructure to keep residents comfortable and mobile year-round.If Dubai succeeds, it won’t just have redefined city living in the Gulf, it may also set a new benchmark for sustainable urban planning in hot climates globally.","Dubai is testing climate-controlled zones and shaded walkways to make its 20-minute city vision viable even during extreme summer heat. The goal is to reduce reliance on private vehicles by building compact, mixed-use communities that encourage local living.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125318051,imgsize-1329123,width-400,resizemode-4/dubai-20-minute-city.jpg"

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.





When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets. The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets. To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125131123,imgsize-132093,width-400,resizemode-4/enigmatic-legal-inquiry.jpg"

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification







Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Many of these tools include built-in time tracking, analyse workforce patterns, and proactively flag inefficiencies in performance trends.Tracking workforce productivity has been part of industry routines, largely at the clients' behest, as companies seek to monitor billable employees and maintain effective oversight.Cognizant, Wipro, and LTIMindtree are using workforce management platform ProHance's productivity solutions selectively, tailoring deployment to client requirements to shape project outcomes in hybrid work models.Meanwhile, TCS, French IT major Capgemini, and HCLTech are understood to rely on Sapience to gauge employee productivity, engagement, and performance, giving team leaders data-driven insights to strengthen overall efficiency. Many firms use multiple tools to track workforce efficiency. Capgemini employees log their work hours through an electronic timesheet application and Sapience Buddy, which captures data on work patterns and productivity, sources told TOI.Emails sent to TCS, Wipro, HCLTech, LTIMindtree, and Capgemini did not elicit responses till the time of going to press. Recent media reports also noted that a ProHance case study claimed Cognizant saved approximately $8 million in a year through the use of its productivity software.When TOI reached out to Cognizant, its spokesperson said, ""We occasionally use various productivity measurement tools, a common industry practice, in selecting business process management or intuitive operations & automation projects, at the request of customers The purpose of these tools is to help better understand the client process steps and related time metrics to assess process design inefficiencies as part of the process transformation efforts.

Meet Charlie Javice: Woman who scammed JP Morgan for $175M — but the bank is paying her $142M legal bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meet-charlie-javice-woman-who-scammed-jp-morgan-for-175m-but-the-bank-is-paying-her-142m-legal-bills/articleshow/125369591.cms,"How a startup deal turned into a massive fraud

A conviction that didn’t stop the bills

The controversial expenses

Why JPMorgan cannot simply stop paying

Charlie Javice’s story sounds almost too bizarre to be real: a young fintech founder who tricked JPMorgan into buying her startup for $175 million, ended up convicted of fraud, and is now serving a prison sentence, yet the same company she scammed is still paying more than $142 million for her legal bills, including questionable expenses like luxury hotel upgrades and “cellulite butter. ”Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid. When JPMorgan considered acquiring the startup in 2021, she reportedly presented the bank with millions of supposed student user accounts. Prosecutors later revealed that these numbers had been fabricated, with Javice allegedly hiring a data scientist to generate fake profiles to inflate Frank’s value.JPMorgan completed the acquisition believing Frank had more than four million users, only to discover after the deal that the platform had a tiny fraction of that. The bank alerted authorities, and by 2023 Javice was arrested on federal fraud charges.In March 2025, Javice was convicted of multiple fraud counts and sentenced to more than seven years in prison. But here’s where the story takes an unusual twist: despite defrauding the bank, she is still allowed to bill JPMorgan for her legal defence because of an indemnification clause included in the acquisition agreement.This contractual protection, which is common in startup buyouts, requires JPMorgan to cover certain legal costs for former executives of Frank.As a result, the bank has already paid over $142 million in defence expenses for Javice and her former colleague Olivier Amar.The clause itself is a standard feature in mergers, designed to protect executives from being financially ruined by lawsuits connected to their time at the company. In normal situations, it is meant to ensure fairness and prevent frivolous legal targeting after an acquisition. But in this case, it has trapped JPMorgan in a bizarre obligation: they must keep funding the defence of someone who defrauded them.Had the bank conducted even a simple, early-stage verification of Frank’s user data—such as requesting direct access to the platform’s actual customer records or running a basic audit—this entire dispute could have been avoided. Instead, delayed due diligence and overconfidence in the startup’s claims set the stage for a costly legal mess that continues years after the fraud was uncovered.JPMorgan’s frustration has grown as the legal bills have ballooned. The bank claims the expenses submitted include personal items such as cellulite butter, first-class travel upgrades, and hotel luxuries. Its lawyers argue that the billing records contain “extreme abuses,” including claims for work hours that seem physically impossible.Javice’s spokesperson denies that she personally submitted these questionable charges, stating that her legal team is responsible for all billing decisions.Even though Javice has already been convicted, she is now appealing her case, and the indemnification clause means the bank must continue paying her legal fees unless a court orders otherwise. JPMorgan is currently trying to convince a Delaware judge to halt these payments, arguing that the system is being misused.The saga has become a major lesson in the risks of fast-paced startup acquisitions. JPMorgan’s failure to properly verify Frank’s user base before buying the company has left it entangled in one of the most embarrassing and expensive due diligence failures in recent corporate history.","Charlie Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid.

"'Future of UX isn't about removing creativity, it is about enhancing it with the right tools'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/future-of-ux-isnt-about-removing-creativity-it-is-about-enhancing-it-with-the-right-tools/articleshow/125401612.cms,"You have had a diverse entrepreneurial journey, from starting 'Impressions' to founding UXMagic.AI. How do you identify opportunities in such varied fields?

Can you share more about what's goal behind the UXMagic.AI platform?

You’re an angel investor and advisor to several startups. What qualities do you look for when investing in or mentoring early-stage companies, and how do you balance this with your own ventures?

As someone who has scaled Red Baton to a 120+ team and now leads UXMagic.AI, what leadership lessons have you learned along the way?





San Francisco-based UXMagic.ai claims to be a personalised on-brand AI First product design tool, enabling teams to design 10x faster. Designers and developers can create project plans, interfaces and optimise their product design with their own design style/system, integrated to their workflow directly from prompts, documents, sketches, or existing Figma files. The platform is said to be fully integrated with Figma, Cursor and other platforms. Founder and CEO UXMagic.AI and Red Baton Digital Ronak Daga talks about his entrepreneurial journey.I have always been a curious kid and loved designing since I was 18, all my ventures have been in the design and marketing field. Crafting designs for products that people love and being customer obsessed were my biggest levers. I moved from print advertising at 19, into web design that eventually got me into UX/UI design and with the rise of AI. I was curious on how it will impact design, that's when me and Adarsh (My CTO) tried looking for something path breaking and innovative in the design field.With AI taking over how we function as a society, it became rather clear to me that every industry is on the brink of transformation.Why should UX design be any different? While many believed automation in UX design was still a distant possibility, I saw an opportunity to strike while the iron was hot.I began experimenting with LLMs and other AI tools to see how much of the UX process could be automated. While these tools had potential, they lacked visual data and deep UX knowledge layers necessary to create truly functional design solutions.Our tool was created for real-world UX needs, trained on 10,000+ components which are a part of our proprietary design system. While full automation of UX design is still evolving, UXMagic.AI already helps professionals streamline major aspects of the design process. The platform enables the automatic creation of user flows, wireframes and visual design, cutting down design time by 60-70%. Additionally, we've made integration seamless—allowing designers to export directly to Figma and vibe coding tools like cursor and windsurf.For developers, UXMagic.AI goes a step further, generating code exports in HTML, React, Webflow, and more at both component and page levels—speeding up development without compromising on design integrity. At its core, UXMagic.AI isn't replacing designers or developers -- it's powering their processes to work smarter, faster, and more efficiently. The future of UX isn't about removing creativity -- it's about enhancing it with the right tools.I look for founders who have the resilience, adaptability, and leadership skills to navigate the highs and lows of entrepreneurship. A great idea is a starting point, but what I look for is their ability to execute. I focus on scalability and realism—ideas that have the potential for long-term growth, backed by numbers that make sense. A business might be ambitious, but if the market, projections, or execution strategy aren't aligned, it becomes difficult to sustain.Balancing investments with my own ventures is about staying actively involved while maintaining strategic distance. I see my role as an advisor rather than an operator, providing guidance and sharing insights, which come into my area of expertise. I practice this thing where I clear a few hours of my schedule every week to track the progress of my investments; this way, I can offer meaningful support, helping founders refine their strategies without micromanaging their journey.Ultimately, successful investing is about aligning with the right people, identifying scalable opportunities, and offering expertise that drives real impact.Scaling a business and driving innovation aren't opposing forces --they have to work in sync. Growth without innovation hinders progress, and innovation without structure leads to a business of no value. One of the biggest leadership lessons I've learned is the power of delegation. One cannot do everything by oneself. What should be done is build a team you can trust to take over, complete your vision, and bring it to life. Every big idea needs the right people to bring your vision to fruition.Another crucial aspect is understanding people— it's about knowing how to bring out the best in your team. Fostering their abilities by building trust, creating opportunities for growth, and aligning people with roles where they genuinely thrive are what make a company scale successfully.","Ronak Daga is the founder and CEO of UXMagic.AI.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

“It makes it sound like, oh, you enter any human in any part of the loop, and it’s going to work out. Whereas, do you really need a human in this loop? When the human actually goes in to look at it, what is the human doing? Is the human reshaping, creating, proctoring? What type of a human do you need? How’s the human from yesterday to today different?”

“From our client service and capabilities perspective, the previous sort of permutations of AI were very limiting. Yes, there was analytics, digital transformation, AI, and ML. But it was not until GenAI started coming up and now, agentic AI—now it’s truly a gift for an industry like ours.”

“human in the loop,”

“The reason why I use this in a metaphor is because you gotta know what the battle count of each agent is. And it’s not static,”

What Genpact’s Jinsook Han thinks about agenctic AI



“From our client service and capabilities perspective, the previous sort of permutations of AI were very limiting. Yes, there was analytics, digital transformation, AI, and ML. But it was not until GenAI started coming up and now, agentic AI—now it’s truly a gift for an industry like ours.”

""Agentic AI Officer""

“his peer and customer.”

“client zero”

“So basically, I work with everyone in the organisation to make sure it’s both horizontal and vertical. And if people say, ‘Jinsook, does this work with strategy. Is it okay?’ Let me actually take off my agentic AI hat and put on the strategy hat, and I can give you the same answer coming from the same person,”





Genpact appointed Jinsook Han as its Chief Strategy, Corporate Development, and Global Agentic AI Officer. With this hire, the technology consulting company has hinted that its shifting focus to AI agents as a key differentiator. However, while discussing AI deployment, Han said that she doesn’t like the common executive phrase. She argues the term is limiting and fails to address the complex strategic questions required for effective agentic AI integration. Han's criticism centres on the lack of specificity the term provides regarding the necessity and type of human involvement.In a statement to Fortune, Han said:For Han, agentic AI represents a significant evolution over previous iterations of the technology, offering greater value to Genpact and its clients. She said:Instead of the vagueHan prefers to describe agent deployment using a metaphor inspired by her son’s Pokémon cards: managing a fleet where each agent has distinct strengths and weaknesses. This approach necessitates careful consideration of how different agents are matched to tasks and combined in scenarios.she added.Han believes agentic AI represents a true breakthrough, offering value that previous iterations of generative AI lacked. She argues that AI agents can deliver real value to both the company and its customers. In a statement to Fortune, Han said,While chief AI officers are common, Genpact's specialisedrole highlights how the company is using AI agents to enhance its service and capabilities.Han, who joined Genpact in 2024, sees her role as spanning both broad and focused responsibilities. This includes collaborating with leaders across the organisation on agentic AI while also overseeing the development of the company’s agentic AI services.One of her key partners is chief technology and innovation officer Sanjeev Vohra, who sets the company’s architectural direction, making herTogether, they co-chair the Genpact Architectural Review Board, where they categorise the company’s agentic AI solutions and ensure they follow internal standards from design through execution.She also works closely with Vidya Rao, Genpact’s chief information and transformation officer. Their work includes applying agentic AI within the company itself, positioning Genpact asto test its capabilities.Han explained.","Genpact appointed Jinsook Han as its Chief Strategy, Corporate Development, and Global Agentic AI Officer.

Microsoft’s 'World’s First AI Superfactory’







Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has highlighted the massive scale of the company’s new infrastructure by comparing the construction effort of its largest datacentre to the creation of the historic Empire State Building, prompting a pointed question from rival tech executive Elon Musk . Suleyman posted an online update regarding Microsoft’s Fairwater datacenter in Atlanta, emphasising the immense labour required.“Already our Fairwater datacenter in Atlanta has taken over 15 million labor hours to build—even more once it’s fully finished,” Suleyman wrote. He then provided a striking historical comparison: “For comparison the Empire State building took 7 million!”Suleyman’s comparison suggested the resource-intensive nature of building modern AI infrastructure capable of supporting advanced models and massive computational demands.However, the post immediately drew a skeptical reply from Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and X. Musk’s concise reaction questioned the efficiency of the effort: “Are you sure you’re doing it right?”Last week, Microsoft unveiled what it is calling the “world’s first planet-scale AI superfactory,” created by connecting massive datacentres in Wisconsin and Atlanta via a high-speed fiber-optic network. The unified system links the two sites, which are roughly 700 miles apart, to function as a single, specialised computing complex for AI.Unlike traditional cloud datacentres, these new facilities are engineered to handle single, large-scale AI workloads that span multiple locations simultaneously. Each datacentre in the network houses hundreds of thousands of Nvidia GPUs.Microsoft is also debuting a new two-story datacentre design that maximises GPU density while minimising latency.",Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has highlighted the massive scale of the company’s new infrastructure.
