NEW DELHI: Expressing serious concern over the deleterious impact of addictive betting applications on youth, the Supreme Court on Friday asked the Centre to respond in two weeks what steps it is contemplating to save youngsters from getting financially ruined, often forcing them to commit suicide.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi asked the counsel for Centre to specify in its affidavit ""what remedial measures it is contemplating after applying mind to the gravity of the issue"".The counsel said another bench is examining whether these apps are akin to gambling, requiring them to be banned, and the decision in that case would have a direct bearing on reliefs sought in a PIL filed by K A Paul. But the bench said, ""You (the Centre) do not appear to take the problem seriously"".The judges also issued notices to some states, RBI, ED, TRAI, Google India, Apple India, Dream11 and other gaming companies to file responses in two weeks.The petitioner had sought a complete ban on illegal betting apps and strict regulation of online gaming and fantasy sports, alleging these are being popularised by film stars, famous cricketers and other celebrities and end up drawing youth to the apps like moths to a flame. He said the more than 150-year-old Public Gambling Act, 1867, is unable to deal with the menace.Over 24 incidents of suicide have been reported from Telangana alone in the last one and a half years and are directly linked to debt traps created by gambling/betting platforms.","Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi asked the counsel for Centre to specify in its affidavit ""what remedial measures it is contemplating"" The judges also issued notices to some states, RBI, ED, TRAI, Google India, Apple India, Dream11 and other gaming companies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123051761,imgsize-42646,width-400,resizemode-4/123051761.jpg"
"'Tech is not the problem, compulsiveness is'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tech-is-not-the-problem-compulsiveness-is/articleshow/123051733.cms,"Who you are will decide how you use technology, says Sadhguru in an exclusive interview. Excerpts:

How big a problem is

digital addiction

, especially for the young? How can they be helped to overcome its ill effects?

How can the young protect their mental health in the modern, fast-paced world? Are changes required in the education system?

Is there an effective way to deal with stress?

You recently had two brain surgeries. How did you and those who are close to you handle the anxiety?

How did you separate physical pain from mental suffering?

It is not technology that is the problem, compulsiveness is. Today, in many countries, they have technology de-addiction centres, where people go to learn how to live without a phone! It's a huge achievement for them to put their phone away for whatever number of days.The beautiful thing about technology is if you learn to use it, it works for you. But who you are will decide how you use it. So what we need to fix right now in the world is who we are. We have all become many things that we are not. Essentially, we are born as life on this planet; the rest of the things are taught to us. We should stop teaching all this stuff which makes us something other than human beings.The internet or a phone is not the problem, but what is on it is the question. Now, some children are playing video games on phones. Two-three hours a day they are practising how to kill someone. Once they turn 18, will they be satisfied just shooting them on the phone? We are putting our children through this, and then we think they are violent, that they are wrong. No. Who is putting this content on the phone? Is it the children? No, adults are putting it - everything has become about commerce.Technology is a tremendous enabler. It gives us the means to reach the entire humanity. This was never possible before. When you have this capability, why do we think we cannot transform the world? We can. But are we committed to making it happen?Instead of reacting compulsively, we must learn to respond consciously to everything.When the British left India, literacy rate was low. Initially, our focus was on basic literacy. However, now the time has come for education to become more specialised and competency-oriented. Today, fewer students are opting for core sciences because our education system has always been job-oriented. Yes, that focus was necessary at one point. But many parents today can support their children as they pursue something meaningful - even if it doesn't immediately translate into economic benefit.We can relax the pace and focus on core education - on sciences, the arts, music. And even within technology, we need to encourage work at the cutting edge, which requires a much deeper level of application. Because if you don't immerse yourself in something, nothing profound will ever come of it.Stress is not in the situation; stress is in the way we are. It's not caused by your job, relationship, or anything external. It's because you haven't learned to manage your body, mind, emotions, and energies. When I first went to the US, I heard the term 'stress management'. I couldn't understand it. Why would anyone want to manage stress? You manage your money, business, relationships - not stress. But in the West, they've come to believe that stress is a universal condition and needs to be managed. However, stress is not a universal phenomenon, it's an individual malady.I had never been in a hospital before; the gown, the setting - everything was new. Was it painful? Absolutely - 100%. Did I suffer mentally? No.Pain is physical. If pain didn't exist, you wouldn't know how to protect your body. Suffering, however, is something you manufacture in your mind. As far as possible, when you walk through life, your job is to avoid creating suffering for others. But if you have mastered the art of creating suffering for yourself, you will inevitably create suffering for others too, knowingly or unknowingly.","Technology is not the problem, but what is on it is the question, says Sadhguru.

Starting August 1, 2025, India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) the backbone of digital transactions will witness a significant upgrade. These changes, implemented by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), are designed to make UPI safer, more efficient, and capable of handling ever-growing transaction volumes.India processes over 12 billion UPI transactions per month, and the system is under constant pressure, especially during peak usage hours. The new rules focus on controlling excessive server requests, protecting users from fraud, and improving overall transaction experience. Key updates include balance enquiry limits, fixed auto-payment windows, restrictions on bank detail access, and enhanced recipient verification measures.If you use Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, Amazon Pay, or any bank-based UPI app, these changes will directly impact your daily transactions.UPI apps often receive millions of daily balance check requests, creating heavy server traffic. From now, users can check their account balance only 50 times per day. To reduce inconvenience, the system will automatically display available balance after every transaction, eliminating the need for repeated manual checks.Auto-debits (subscriptions, loan repayments, OTT payments) create sudden load spikes during peak banking hours.From August 1:Users can now view linked bank accounts only 25 times per day. This prevents misuse by malicious apps or repeated refresh requests, improving data safety and reducing load on bank servers.Many users repeatedly check the status of pending transactions, which strains servers. Now, users can check transaction status only three times, with a mandatory 90-second gap between attempts. This change aims to cut down unnecessary traffic while still giving users visibility of their funds.Before confirming any payment, the recipient’s registered name and transaction ID will be displayed. This feature prevents accidental transfers to incorrect UPI IDs or fraudulent accounts pretending to be legitimate businesses.NPCI has warned UPI app providers: failure to implement these changes could lead to API restrictions, financial penalties, or suspension of new customer onboarding.The decision to update UPI rules stems from two main concerns:No. Sending and receiving money remains unaffected. The rules focus mainly on balance checks, auto-pay processing, and fraud prevention features.Excessive balance requests (especially by third-party apps) cause unnecessary server load. Limiting to 50 checks per day ensures stable performance for all users.Recurring payments may be processed slightly earlier or later than scheduled. Users will receive notifications when payments are executed, preventing missed due dates.Yes, but only three times, with a 90-second gap between attempts. This helps free up system resources for actual money transfers.Yes, they are part of NPCI’s long-term strategy to manage growing UPI traffic and improve user safety.","India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) the backbone of digital transactions will witness a significant upgrade.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warns ChatGPT users’ personal questions could be used in lawsuits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/think-before-you-ask-why-chatgpt-legal-queries-can-be-used-against-you-as-court-evidence/articleshow/123034984.cms,"Your ChatGPT conversations are not legally confidential



AI-Generated legal advice isn’t actually legal advice



Deleted chats with AI aren’t safe from legal scrutiny



Why it’s best to speak with a human lawyer instead of ChatGPT



Also Read:





ChatGPT may be quick and convenient, but using it for legal questions could backfire in serious ways. Many users aren’t aware that anything they type into the chatbot, even deleted messages, can be retained and used as evidence in legal proceedings. Unlike lawyers, AI tools are not bound by confidentiality or ethical obligations. This means that sharing sensitive legal concerns with a chatbot doesn't just offer unreliable advice; it may also create a discoverable digital trail. Before you confide in AI, it is important to understand the risks and why human legal counsel is still essential.In a recent appearance on the This Past Weekend podcast hosted by comedian Theo Von, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made a candid admission: conversations with ChatGPT are not protected under any kind of legal privilege. ""Right now, if you talk to a therapist or a lawyer or a doctor, there’s legal privilege for it,"" Altman explained. ""There’s doctor-patient confidentiality, there’s legal confidentiality. And we haven’t figured that out yet for when you talk to ChatGPT. "" This means if you type out a sensitive legal scenario, say, describing an incident that might amount to a crime or seeking strategic legal advice, that chat can potentially be disclosed in court.According to Altman, OpenAI could be legally compelled to hand over your conversations, even if they’ve been deleted.The consequences of this are serious. Legal experts like Jessee Bundy from Creative Counsel have warned users not to mistake AI for actual legal representation. ""If you're pasting in contracts, asking legal questions, or asking [the chatbot] for strategy, you're not getting legal advice,"" Jessee E. Bundy posted on X (formerly Twitter). ""You’re generating discoverable evidence. No attorney-client privilege. No confidentiality. No ethical duty. No one to protect you."" She added that ChatGPT may feel private and helpful, but unlike a licensed attorney, it has no legal obligation to act in your best interest, and it can’t be held accountable for any incorrect advice it generates.When Malte Landwehr, CEO of an AI company, suggested that ChatGPT could still provide useful legal input even if it’s not confidential, Bundy strongly pushed back.“ChatGPT can’t give you legal advice,” she replied. “Legal advice comes from a licensed professional who understands your specific facts, goals, risks, and jurisdiction. And is accountable for it. ChatGPT is a language model. It generates words that sound right based on patterns, but it doesn’t know your situation, and it’s not responsible if it’s wrong.” Calling it “legal Mad Libs,” Bundy stressed that relying on ChatGPT for legal issues is both risky and potentially self-incriminating.User conversations with AI chatbots, including those that have been deleted, may still be stored and subject to disclosure in legal proceedings. As highlighted by ongoing litigation, some companies are required to retain chat records, which could be subpoenaed in court. This includes potentially sensitive or personal exchanges.At present, there is no legal obligation for AI platforms to treat user chats as confidential in the same way communications with a lawyer or therapist are protected. Until laws are updated to account for AI interactions, users should be aware that anything typed into a chatbot could, in some cases, be used as evidence.For legal concerns, whether it’s about a contract, criminal matter, or a rights dispute, it’s essential to consult a licensed professional. Unlike AI, lawyers are bound by strict confidentiality, legal privilege, and ethical duties. AI-generated responses may feel private and helpful, but they are not protected, verified, or accountable. While it may be tempting to turn to AI for convenience, doing so for legal issues could expose you to unnecessary risk.As artificial intelligence becomes more common in everyday use, it’s important to recognise its limitations, especially in areas involving legal or personal stakes. Conversations with AI are not protected under legal privilege, and in the eyes of the law, they can be accessed like any other form of communication. Until privacy and legal frameworks are in place for AI, it’s safest to avoid using chatbots for legal questions. For advice you can trust and that will remain confidential, always consult a qualified legal professional.","ChatGPT may be quick and convenient, but using it for legal questions could backfire in serious ways.

'Ask daddy for a bumblebee': Toddler after surviving 18-storey fall; father honours tree with red flower,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/ask-daddy-for-a-bumblebee-toddler-after-surviving-18-storey-fall-father-honours-tree-with-red-flower/articleshow/123054672.cms,"AI Image used for Representative purpose





China witnessed a miracle when a boy, who is just three years old, miraculously survived an extraordinary 18-storey fall from his residential building, with a tree breaking his fall.The event occurred on July 15 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, southeastern China, while the young boy was under his grandparents' supervision, South China Morning Post reported.The grandparents had stepped out briefly to purchase groceries, believing the child was asleep. They secured the flat's door to ensure his safety.Upon waking, the child entered the bathroom, which had an unprotected window. He climbed onto the toilet and subsequently the window, from which he fell.A tree intercepted his fall, enabling his survival. His father later placed a large red flower on the tree in appreciation.A passing resident discovered him and recorded a video, sharing it with the property management.The father, Zhu, initially doubted the 18-storey fall until viewing surveillance footage. He explained that an open window on the 17th floor altered his son's falling path, directing him towards the tree that cushioned his landing.At the hospital, staff termed his survival miraculous. His injuries included a broken left arm, spinal strain and internal organ damage, though his head remained uninjured.Remarkably, the conscious child requested: ""Ask Daddy to buy me a Bumblebee.""Zhu presented a large red flower to the tree, a traditional Chinese symbol of honour. The incident sparked online discussions, with comments ranging from criticism of parental oversight to expressions of relief at the boy's survival.","Three-year-old boy falls from 18-storey building in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China.

"Frozen in time: Tattooed remains of 2,500-year-old Siberian ‘ice mummy’ revealed; how were they made millennia ago?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/frozen-in-time-tattooed-remains-of-2500-year-old-siberian-ice-mummy-revealed-how-were-they-made-millennia-ago/articleshow/123035197.cms,"



In many cultures, tattoos have long symbolised rebellion or a break from tradition. But for others, they are deeply personal, woven into identity, heritage, and belief. Such was the case for the ancient Pazyryk people.An intricate body art of a 2,500-year-old Siberian “ice mummy” from this nomadic tribe has been uncovered using advanced infrared imaging, offering an extraordinary glimpse into their sophisticated tattooing culture and way of life.Discovered in 1993 on the Okok Plateau in Russia’s Altai Mountains, the mummy is believed to have belonged to a nomadic Pazyryk tribe that roamed the Eurasian plains between the 6th and 3rd centuries BC.Nicknamed as the “Ice Maiden”, the remarkably preserved 50-year-old woman is one of three bodies found frozen in permafrost, her skin still marked with striking inked designs across much of her body.Thanks to high-resolution infrared imaging, researchers have now uncovered a detailed array of animal motifs etched into her skin, including a leopard, stag, rooster and a griffin-like creature.Her arms are adorned with the leopard and stag, a half-lion half-eagle beast rests on her leg, while a rooster is inked onto her thumb, New York Post reported.Gino Caspari, lead researcher from the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology, told the BBC, “The insights really drive home to me the point of how sophisticated these people were.”“This made me feel like we were much closer to seeing the people behind the art, how they worked and learned. The images came alive,” he added.Caspari estimated the time and effort involved in tattooing the Ice Maiden, remarking, “If I was guessing, it was probably four and a half hours for the lower half of the right arm, and another five hours for the upper part.”“That’s a solid commitment from the person,” the researcher added.Emphasising the skill involved, Caspari said, “It would need to be performed by a person who knows health and safety, who knows the risks of what happens when the skin is punctured.”The tattoos were created using a process similar to modern techniques, starting with a stencil applied to the skin before the ink was inserted with a needle-like instrument.“And back in the day it was already a really professional practice where people put a lot of time and effort and practice into creating these images and they’re extremely sophisticated.”The study suggests that the tattoos held significance during life rather than in the afterlife, shedding light on the cultural practices and artistry of the Pazyryk tribe.“It suggests that tattoos were really something for the living with meaning during life, but that they didn’t really play much of a role in the afterlife,” Caspari concluded.","2,500-year-old Siberian ‘ice mummy’ has intricate tattoos on her skin.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's biggest fear: ChatGPT-5 is coming in August and Altman is scared — know why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/openai-ceo-sam-altmans-biggest-fear-chatgpt-5-is-coming-in-august-and-altman-is-scared-know-why/articleshow/123034747.cms,"ChatGPT-5 feels “very fast,” says Sam Altman

ChatGPT-5 could redefine intelligence and risk

A stepping stone to AGI?

Internal and external pressure on OpenAI





As artificial intelligence continues to advance at an astonishing pace, even the leaders at its forefront are beginning to voice concern. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has openly admitted feeling “scared” about the upcoming release of GPT-5, the newest and most powerful version of ChatGPT. Scheduled to launch in August 2025, GPT-5 is expected to significantly surpass its predecessors in speed and capability. Yet it is precisely this rapid evolution that has led Altman to compare its development to the Manhattan Project. His candid remarks, shared during a recent podcast appearance, highlight growing unease about the lack of oversight, ethical uncertainty, and the accelerating race toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).Speaking on Theo Von’s This Past Weekend podcast, Altman confessed that testing GPT-5 left him with a profound sense of unease. “It feels very fast,” he said, referring not just to the model’s impressive processing power, but to the alarming speed at which AI is advancing overall. His remarks echoed the reflective anxiety of scientists involved in the Manhattan Project, who, after creating the atomic bomb, grappled with the unintended consequences of their innovation.Altman invoked a similar moment of reckoning, asking rhetorically, “What have we done?” The comparison underscores his concern that GPT-5, like nuclear technology before it, may mark a pivotal turning point—one where humanity’s ability to build something outpaces its readiness to understand or control the fallout.He emphasized that while technical achievements are accelerating, the moral, social, and legal frameworks to contain them are not keeping pace. He explicitly stated that testing GPT-5 left him “very nervous” and that its development feels reminiscent of a science fiction thriller.One of Altman’s most pointed comments was about the lack of control in AI development. “It feels like there are no adults in the room,” he said, suggesting that regulatory frameworks have not kept up with AI's breakneck speed. While OpenAI advocates for responsible deployment, the pace at which GPT-5 was built may have outstripped safety protocols and human readiness. These remarks have sparked fresh debate about who, if anyone, is truly in charge of monitoring such transformative technologies.While specifics about GPT-5 remain under wraps, insiders suggest it will feature major upgrades over GPT-4, including improved multi-step reasoning, longer memory, and more advanced multimodal capabilities. It is also expected to reduce model-switching delays, offering more seamless user interactions. But with power comes risk. Altman has openly said that GPT-4 “kind of sucks” compared to what’s coming next. That raises alarms about how much more potent and possibly uncontrollable GPT-5 could be. Concerns are mounting about how society will distinguish between authentic human thought and AI-generated insightAltman has long discussed AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence, as OpenAI’s north star. But GPT-5 may be the company’s closest step yet to that goal. While Altman once claimed the arrival of AGI would pass with little societal upheaval, his new tone is more cautionary. If GPT-5 gets us significantly closer to AGI-level capabilities, the lack of global consensus on how to manage such a leap could become a major problem. The shift from AI that assists to AI that independently reasons and acts could happen faster than institutions can respond.Behind the scenes, OpenAI is reportedly under immense pressure from investors to transition into a for-profit entity by year-end. With Microsoft holding a 13.5 billion dollar stake in the company, and other competitors like Google DeepMind and Perplexity.ai surging forward, GPT-5 could be a make-or-break moment. Some reports even suggest OpenAI might declare AGI prematurely to end its contract with Microsoft, triggering new power dynamics in the AI sector.While some observers have dismissed Altman’s remarks as theatrical marketing, his track record suggests otherwise. His fear appears genuine, not of AI turning evil, but of humans losing control over the systems they’ve built. In a space where speed is often equated with success, Altman’s words might be the first honest pause in a race most of the world barely understands.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has openly admitted feeling “scared” about the upcoming release of GPT-5, the newest and most powerful version of ChatGPT.

Tesla crash case: Miami jury holds Elon Musk's company liable in autopilot crash that killed woman; awards $329 million in damages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tesla-crash-case-miami-jury-holds-elon-musks-company-liable-in-autopilot-crash-that-killed-woman-awards-329-million-in-damages/articleshow/123050835.cms,"Miami jury holds Elon Musk's company liable in autopilot crash that killed woman (Image credits: AP)





A Miami federal jury on Friday ordered Tesla to pay $329 million in damages over a deadly 2019 crash involving its Autopilot driver-assistance system, a rare courtroom defeat that could have major implications for the company and its self-driving technology.The verdict came after the jury found Tesla’s Autopilot system shared responsibility for the crash that killed 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon and seriously injured her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo.The couple had been stargazing by the roadside in Key Largo, Florida, when they were struck by a Tesla vehicle. The driver admitted to being distracted by his cellphone but claimed he had relied on the Autopilot feature to control the car, reported AP.Jurors determined that Tesla's technology had failed to prevent the collision and that the company could not shift all blame to the human behind the wheel. The decision marks one of the first times Tesla has been held publicly accountable by a jury for a fatal crash involving its driver-assist software.The outcome comes at a critical time for Tesla and CEO Elon Musk, who is preparing to launch a fully driverless taxi service in several cities and continues to champion the safety of Tesla’s autonomous driving technology.The four-year legal battle revealed claims by the victims’ attorneys that Tesla had either hidden or misplaced key crash data, including internal logs and video footage recorded just before the impact. After a forensic expert hired by the plaintiffs uncovered the data, Tesla acknowledged it had the information but said it had been unaware of its location.The case stood out not just for its outcome, but because it made it to trial. Many similar lawsuits involving Tesla crashes have either been dismissed or quietly settled. Legal experts believe this verdict could change that.“This will open the floodgates,” said Miguel Custodio, a personal injury attorney not involved in the case, as quoted by AP. “It will embolden a lot of people to come to court.”Tesla has faced previous accusations of being slow to provide crash data to victims’ families — claims the company has consistently denied. In this case, however, the jury sided with the plaintiffs, concluding the automaker was at least partially responsible.","Jurors found Tesla's Autopilot system shared responsibility for the crash that killed 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon and seriously injured her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo.

A British woman has come under fire after having an issue over Marks & Spencer employees at London Heathrow Airport speaking in Hindi. Lucy White, who describes herself as a public policy specialist, shared her incident in a post on X, which quickly went viral and drew widespread criticism. Many accused her of racism and intolerance in a multicultural environment.White wrote that she had just arrived at Terminal 3 of the airport and visited the M&S store, where she overheard three staff members speaking in a language other than English. When she asked them what language they were speaking, the employees told her it was Hindi, the most widely spoken language in India.“I have a voice recording & their names to report to M&S. We must confront them every time,” she added.Her post drew backlash with users online calling her racist and many questioning why she found it offensive and what rules the employees had broken.This incident is not the first time White has faced criticism for similar remarks. A few weeks ago, she posted another tweet targeting Indian and Asian employees at Heathrow, claiming they spoke “not a word of English.” She added that when she asked them to speak English, they called her a “racist.”One user, on her latest post, commented, “Confront people who talk in a different language? No thanks. We should however confront vile bigots like yourself that make this country a much sadder, less friendlier place.”Another user said, “How embarrassing. Heaven forbid someone speaks more than one language if they work in a major international airport.”","Lucy White shared her incident in a post on X, which quickly went viral and drew widespread criticism.

TL;DR

E-cigarettes (vapes) are legal to own and use in Dubai, but only in certain places.

You can’t use them indoors or in most public spaces.

Fines range from AED 500 to AED 2,000 for breaking the rules.

Offices

Airports (outside of smoking lounges)

Government buildings

Beaches and parks

What About Tourists Carrying E-Cigarettes?

You must be over 18 to carry or buy them.

Items should be stored safely, preferably in checked baggage.

E-liquid must follow airline rules: no more than 100 ml per container, sealed in a clear plastic bag.

Penalties If You Break the Rules

What You Can and Can’t Do

Know the law. Regulations can change, so check the latest rules before using or carrying e-cigarettes around the city. Stick to smoking zones. Only use e-cigarettes in areas where smoking is clearly allowed. These are often marked and found in some outdoor public spaces. Never use them indoors. That includes malls, restaurants, offices, taxis, and enclosed public places. Even if no one stops you, it's still illegal. Respect cultural norms. Dubai is diverse, and public behavior matters. Be mindful of how using e-cigarettes might come across to others, especially in family spaces. Ask if you’re not sure. When in a hotel, café, or private space, ask staff if e-cigarette use is allowed before using your device. Dispose of waste properly. Don’t leave used cartridges, packaging, or devices behind. Use bins—littering can lead to fines. Follow the house rules. Private businesses may have their own policies. Even if the city allows it, a venue might not. Keep yourself updated. Laws can shift. Stay informed, especially if you're a frequent traveler or plan to stay in the UAE long term.

Health Concerns





If you’re visiting Dubai, or living there, you’ve probably noticed how clean and well-organized public spaces are. The city takes rules seriously. That includes how it handles smoking and vaping.While you might see someone using an e-cigarette (also called a vape), outside a mall or on a sidewalk, that doesn’t mean it’s allowed. Dubai has clear rules on where you can vape, what kind of products are legal, and who can use them. These rules are part of a broader effort to protect public health and respect social norms.So if you’re traveling with a vape or thinking about using one in public, it’s important to understand how the laws work. The last thing you want is to face a fine, or worse, because you didn’t know the local rules.Let’s break it down clearly.The UAE officially legalized the sale and use of e-cigarettes in 2019. That made it legal for licensed shops to sell devices, refills, and accessories, as long as they meet local standards. But legalization didn’t make them welcome everywhere.Dubai restricts where e-cigarettes can be used. Just like with traditional cigarettes, you can't use them in enclosed or public indoor spaces. That includes:If you’re in a shared public space, chances are it’s a no-go zone for e-cigarette use unless there's a designated smoking area.Tourists can bring e-cigarettes into Dubai for personal use. That includes disposable devices, liquids, and chargers. But there are a few things to keep in mind:Dubai customs may inspect your bags. If something looks suspicious or exceeds limits, it could be confiscated. Bringing small, clearly personal-use quantities is usually fine.Fines for using e-cigarettes in the wrong places in Dubai can be quite steep. If you’re caught, you may have to pay anywhere from AED 500 (about $135) up to AED 2,000 (around $545). Repeat offenses can lead to even higher fines or possible legal action. There’s usually no warning, as enforcement is strict, especially in places like shopping malls, airports, and metro stations where surveillance is common.If you're using e-cigarettes (vapes) in Dubai, here are a few key things to keep in mind to avoid issues:The rules around e-cigarettes in Dubai are strict mainly because of health concerns. Authorities across the UAE worry about the long-term risks of nicotine products, including those found in e-cigarette liquids. Issues like high levels of nicotine salts, chemical additives in flavored liquids, and the risk of minors misusing these products all play a part. On top of that, there’s a strong public effort to discourage smoking and nicotine use overall. That’s why you’ll often see awareness campaigns aimed at quitting completely, not just switching from traditional cigarettes to e-cigarettes.","E-cigarettes are legal to own and use in Dubai, but only in certain places. You can’t use them indoors or in most public spaces. Fines range from AED 500 to AED 2,000 for breaking the rules.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122991850,imgsize-56568,width-400,resizemode-4/122991850.jpg"

Bringing Structure and Modern Relevance to Mosque Lessons

A Qualitative Leap Guided by Core Values



Serving the Whole Community with Three Main Tracks



About IACAD







The Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department in Dubai (IACAD) has introduced a fresh initiative called “Development of Mosque Lessons and Unification of Preaching Content” as part of its IACAD-X projects. This program is designed to improve the quality and consistency of religious lessons in mosques across Dubai, making them more relevant and engaging for today’s diverse community.The main goal of this project is to enhance mosque lessons by standardizing their content within a modern preaching framework. This framework strikes a balance between maintaining religious authenticity and being adaptable enough to address the realities of contemporary society. It recognizes the important role mosques play in educating the community and aims to strengthen this role by providing structured, easy-to-understand religious messages.The curriculum is carefully organized around essential topics and core concepts that resonate with people’s everyday lives. The content is also tailored for different age groups, with special attention given to children and youth. These lessons are delivered using interactive storytelling methods, making them more engaging.Notably, each lesson is designed to be concise and impactful, lasting no longer than five minutes to keep attention and maximize understanding.Jasem Mohammed Al Khazraji, the project lead, explained that this initiative marks a significant improvement in how religious lessons are delivered. “This initiative represents a qualitative leap in the methodology of delivering religious lessons,” he said. The program is built around six core values that are explored over two-month cycles. Each year, these values are refreshed through narratives drawn from the stories of the prophets, the biography of the Prophet Muhammad, and relevant Quranic verses.What sets this project apart is its heartfelt and relatable language, designed specifically for the new generation. Instead of a one-way lecture, lessons encourage live engagement with audiences, making the learning experience more interactive and meaningful.The project comprises three main educational tracks intended to meet the needs of all mosque visitors. Alongside these, there is a special recurring segment called “Children and Families of the Neighbourhood.” This segment aims to strengthen the bond between families and the mosque, positioning the mosque as a central place for fostering positive values and upbringing within the community.Overall, this initiative is a forward-looking step in reshaping religious education in Dubai’s mosques, ensuring that lessons are not only rooted in tradition but also resonate deeply with people’s daily experiences and modern realities.The Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department (IACAD) in Dubai, established by Law No. (2) of 2011, oversees Islamic affairs and charitable work in the emirate. It promotes Islamic knowledge, supervises religious content, and licenses charitable organizations, mosques, and Islamic institutions. IACAD also manages Hajj and Umrah affairs, organizes religious events, and raises awareness about Zakat and charity. Originating from the 1969 Department of Endowments, IACAD’s role expanded through laws in 1994 and 2011 to cover charitable, Islamic, and mosque-related activities.","The Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department in Dubai (IACAD) has introduced a fresh initiative called “Development of Mosque Lessons and Unification of Preaching Content” This program is designed to improve the quality and consistency of religious lessons in mosques across Dubai, making them more relevant and engaging.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122978235,imgsize-103,width-400,resizemode-4/122978235.jpg"

Fitness, patriotism, and politics





President Donald Trump has officially revived the iconic Presidential Fitness Test, once a hallmark of American physical education classes. With the stroke of an executive order on July 31, Trump aims to “Make America Fit Again” by reinstating rigorous physical challenges for schoolchildren nationwide, including mile runs, push-ups, and sit-ups. Citing rising obesity rates and declining youth fitness, the Trump administration argues that performance-based assessments will foster a stronger, healthier generation. The move marks a sharp reversal of the Obama-era program that had shifted focus from physical performance to long-term wellness.The Presidential Fitness Test was first introduced in 1956 by President Dwight Eisenhower to address concerns that American children were falling behind their global peers in physical health. It quickly became a staple in schools, assessing strength, endurance, and flexibility through standardized exercises. For decades, students trained to earn the coveted Presidential Fitness Award. But by 2013, the Obama administration replaced the test with a more holistic program focusing on lifelong health habits and personal fitness goals, marking a shift away from high-pressure physical benchmarks. Supporters claim the move will re-instill a sense of national pride through personal discipline and achievement.Trump’s latest executive order reintroduces the test across public schools and reinstates the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been tasked with overseeing the effort and shaping updated criteria for the modern era. The council will create new school-based programs, reward high-achieving students with a renewed Presidential Fitness Award, and help align the test with goals of American youth strength, military readiness, and healthy living.The revived Presidential Fitness Test will include several familiar components that measure a student's physical capabilities:These tests will be evaluated against age-based benchmarks. While the test will be required in physical education classes, how results impact grading will vary by school district.The Obama-era shift toward the Presidential Youth Fitness Program was designed to reduce competition and anxiety in fitness assessments. Health experts at the time argued the traditional test led to unhealthy comparisons, discouraged participation, and made students feel judged rather than supported. The new model emphasized personal progress and allowed teachers, students, and parents to use scores privately to encourage improvement rather than public performance.Despite strong support from Trump and his base, the return of the test has sparked pushback from educators and health professionals. Critics argue that:Nevertheless, the administration insists the rebooted test will include updated guidelines to promote fairness and student well-being while restoring national fitness goals.Trump’s revival of the test is about more than just exercise. “Make America Fit Again” is both a slogan and a signal—a return to an era of discipline, competition, and national pride. The move aligns with his broader cultural message emphasizing strength, readiness, and traditional American values. It also serves as a campaign talking point, reinforcing Trump’s message of national renewal through personal accountability. As schools prepare to reintroduce this once-feared challenge, the question remains: will the old-school fitness test help shape a healthier generation, or reignite an old debate about how we define wellness in America’s youth?","The Presidential Fitness Test was first introduced in 1956 by President Dwight Eisenhower to address concerns that American children were falling behind their global peers in physical health. For decades, students trained to earn the coveted Presidential Fitness Award. But by 2013, the Obama administration replaced the test with a more holistic program focusing on lifelong health habits.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123042502,imgsize-64354,width-400,resizemode-4/123042502.jpg"
Worlds oldest baby born from 30-year-old frozen embryo: A breakthrough in fertility science,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/worlds-oldest-baby-born-from-30-year-old-frozen-embryo-a-breakthrough-in-fertility-science/articleshow/123034758.cms,"30-year-old frozen embryo results in healthy birth of world's oldest baby





The role of embryo adoption: Giving frozen life a second chance



Medical and ethical implications in the process of fertility





In a historic medical breakthrough, a baby named Thaddeus Daniel Pierce was born in July 2025 from an embryo that had been frozen for over 30 years. This sets a new world record for the oldest frozen embryo to result in a live birth, showing the incredible progress in IVF technology and embryo cryopreservation. The embryo was created in 1994 and adopted by a couple in Ohio after being stored for decades. This rare case highlights the possibilities of embryo adoption, offering hope to families struggling with infertility and marking a major milestone in fertility science and medicine.The embryo that became baby Thaddeus was originally created through IVF in 1994 for a woman named Linda Archerd, who used one of the embryos at the time and gave birth to a daughter. The remaining embryos were frozen and stored at a fertility clinic. For over 30 years, they remained in cryogenic preservation, frozen in liquid nitrogen at temperatures.In 2023, Linda Archerd decided to make her unused embryos available for embryo adoption, a process that allows other families to adopt and use frozen embryos to conceive children. She chose to work with a Christian embryo adoption agency called Nightlight Christian Adoptions, through their well-known “Snowflakes” program.This program enables embryo donors to select the adoptive family and set specific preferences, such as religion, race, and nationality.According to a BBC report, Linda requested that the embryos be placed with a married, Caucasian, Christian couple from the United States. The embryos were eventually matched with Lindsey and Tim Pierce, a couple from Ohio who had been struggling with infertility for nearly a decade. One embryo was successfully transferred, resulting in the birth of Thaddeus—the world’s oldest baby born from a frozen embryo.Experts say this case proves that long-term freezing does not damage embryo viability, as long as the proper preservation techniques are followed. It also demonstrates the emotional and life-changing impact that embryo adoption can have on families looking for alternative paths to parenthood.Embryo adoption is a lesser-known option available to couples who cannot conceive naturally. Unlike traditional adoption, embryo adoption allows the recipient mother to carry and give birth to the child. Embryos originally created by other couples during IVF treatments are donated for future use.In this case, the original embryo donors (Linda and her family) made a deeply personal decision to donate their unused embryos to a faith-based embryo adoption program, which matched them with the Pierce family.The Pierces were open to using older embryos and felt spiritually guided to accept the unique opportunity. The fact that the embryo was 30 years old did not deter them, especially after learning that storage duration has no significant impact on embryo quality if handled correctly.The birth of Thaddeus has medical professionals, ethicists, and hopeful parents talking. Doctors point out that this case proves embryos can remain viable even after decades, making long-term cryopreservation a realistic and safe strategy.For people considering IVF, this offers more flexibility and control over family planning. For instance, couples who freeze embryos in their 20s or 30s may now choose to use them decades later without concern about success rates. Ethically, however, it also brings attention to the large number of unused embryos currently frozen around the world.Should they be preserved indefinitely? Should donors be encouraged to offer them up for adoption? These questions are becoming more pressing as science continues to outpace public awareness and regulation. Nevertheless, the successful birth of a healthy baby from such an old embryo stands as a symbol of hope for millions facing fertility struggles, and shows just how powerful and advanced reproductive medicine has become. It also raises profound ethical and emotional questions about the future of stored embryos and the rights of all parties involved.",A baby named Thaddeus Daniel Pierce was born in July 2025 from an embryo that had been frozen for over 30 years.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Fortnite-maker Epic Games wins major victory as court upholds Google Play Store monopoly ruling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/fortnite-maker-epic-games-wins-major-victory-as-court-upholds-google-play-store-monopoly-ruling/articleshow/123049991.cms,"Google now must open Android to third-party app stores

Legal battle continues despite Epic's courtroom success

The US’ Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has rejected Google's appeal in the Epic Games lawsuit, affirming that Google's Play Store and payment systems constitute illegal monopolies. The decision forces Google to implement sweeping changes to Android's app ecosystem within three years, including allowing rival app stores on Google Play and ending exclusive payment requirements.The appeals court lifted a stay that had temporarily paused most injunction requirements while Google pursued its appeal, clearing the path for immediate implementation of the court-ordered remedies.Under the permanent injunction, Google faces unprecedented restrictions on its Android business model. The company must distribute competing app stores through Google Play and provide rivals with access to its complete app catalog.Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney , who called this a ""total victory,"" announced that the Epic Games Store for Android will launch directly within Google Play Store Google is also banned from requiring developers to use Google Play Billing and from striking revenue-sharing deals with device manufacturers to preinstall its store.Google plans to escalate its appeal to the Supreme Court, with the company warning that the decision ""will significantly harm user safety, limit choice, and undermine innovation."" The tech giant had argued that the injunction imposed ""burdensome contractual restrictions"" without justification.The case originated in 2020 when Epic embedded secret code in Fortnite to bypass Google's payment system, prompting Google to remove the popular game from its store. A 2023 jury unanimously found Google guilty of operating illegal monopolies in Android app distribution and in-app billing markets.Unlike Epic's largely unsuccessful lawsuit against Apple, the Google case revealed internal documents showing revenue-sharing agreements and concerns about competitive threats, helping Epic secure its landmark victory in the ongoing battle over mobile app store dominance.",Google must open Android to third-party app stores within three years.
