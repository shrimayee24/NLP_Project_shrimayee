Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage for a candid and humours conversation. The tech titans shared their thoughts on the future on generative AI and the long road to building tech empires. In a lighthearted moment, Huang joked that if he had known how long it would take to succeed, the he might have followed Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s oath and dropped out of college early. “If I had known it was going to take so long to succeed… I would've dropped out of college just like you,” Huang quipped, drawing laughter from the audience and Zuckerberg himself.The discussion involving Huang and Zuckerberg spanned around decades of innovation. The discussion started with Zuckerberg praising Huang’s role in powering the AI revolution. “It’s all you—you kind of made this happen,” Zuckerberg said, referring to Nvidia’s dominance in AI infrastructure.Responding to Zuckerberg, Jensen Huang said, “Why thank you… CEOs, we're delicate flowers,” poking fun at the need for appreciation even at the top.Along with this, the two tech leaders also joked about aging and appearances.“We’re pretty grizzled at this point,” Zuckerberg said. “I think we’re the two longest-standing founders in the industry.” Huang agreed, noting his gray hair while Zuckerberg commented on his curls.Huang founded Nvidia in 1993 with just the investment of $200. He launched the company on his 30th birthday which was later joined by co-founders Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. Nvidia started with a mission to advance 3D graphics. The breakthrough came in 1999 with the invention of the GPU, a technology that transformed computing.Fast forward to October 2025, Nvidia has entered the $5 trillion club. The chip maker managed to reach the market valuation of $5 trillion in just three months after crossing $ 4 trillion. This growth in Nvidia's market value suggest the escalating momentum in AI adoption across industries. Shares of Nvidia rose more than 4%, pushing its market capitalisation. Nvidia ranks ahead of Microsoft ($4 trillion) and Apple ($3.9 trillion), as well as Google parent Alphabet ($3.2 trillion), Amazon ($2.4 trillion) and Meta ($1.8 trillion).Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s journey started from his dorm room in Harvard in 2004, from where he started Facebook . He famously dropped out in 2005 to focus on the company, turning down his father’s offer to invest in a McDonald’s franchise.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says ‘Slack creates a lot of fake work’; Elon Musk responds: ‘As I was saying …’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sam-altman-says-slack-creates-a-lot-of-fake-work-elon-musk-responds-as-i-was-saying-/articleshow/125213230.cms,"



Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reacted sharply to Sam Altman ’s remarks about office productivity tools like Slack, saying that the ChatGPT-maker OpenAI will “compete directly with Microsoft”. Sam Altman, founder and CEO of OpenAI recently said that while there are many positives about Slack, it also creates a “lot of fake work”. In a now viral clip, Altman about how current workplace tools — such as Slack, Google Docs, email, and PowerPoint — may soon be replaced by a new generation of AI-driven systems.“There are positives about Slack,” Altman said, “but I kind of dread the first hour of the morning or last time before I go to bed, where I’m just dealing with this explosion of Slack. It creates a lot of fake work.”Altman added that he believes a new kind of AI-powered productivity platform is within reach — one where “your AI agent and my AI agent” will handle most communication and tasks, escalating only when necessary.Elon Musk, who has long been critical of OpenAI’s close partnership with Microsoft, responded on X (formerly known as Twitter) with a pointed remark: “As I was saying, OpenAI will compete directly with Microsoft.”In another post on X, Musk wrote: ""At this point, it’s insanely suicidal for Microsoft to continue supporting OpenAI""The exchange comes as AI companies race to redefine workplace productivity. While Microsoft has heavily invested in “Copilot” features across its apps, Altman’s comments suggest OpenAI could be developing its own tools that may compete in the same space.In a recent post shared on X, Altman suggested that the company is planning another major new business venture, putting it in direct competition with cloud technology giants, including Google, Amazon and Microsoft.Sam Altman wrote in the post: “We are also looking at ways to more directly sell compute capacity to other companies (and people); we are pretty sure the world is going to need a lot of 'AI cloud', and we are excited to offer this.”This means OpenAI could soon start selling cloud services, putting it in competition with established providers such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud. In September, OpenAI Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Sarah Friar made a similar point, suggesting that cloud providers had been “learning on our dime.” Her comment indicated that OpenAI was looking to safeguard its AI expertise from technology companies that may use its developments to advance their own capabilities.","Sam Altman, founder and CEO of OpenAI recently said that while there are many positives about Slack, it also creates a “lot of fake work” Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reacted sharply to Altman’s remarks about office productivity tools like Slack, saying that OpenAI will “compete directly with Microsoft”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125213222,imgsize-28312,width-400,resizemode-4/sam-altman-elon-musk.jpg"

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode

Microsoft charts different path with 'humanist' approach to advanced AI

'No reassuring answer' exists for controlling ever-smarter AI systems, Microsoft’s AI chief admits





Microsoft's AI chief Mustafa Suleyman is drawing a line in the sand as tech giants race to build superintelligent systems, declaring that raw capability must take a backseat to human control. ""We can't build superintelligence just for superintelligence's sake,"" Suleyman said, days after unveiling Microsoft's new MAI Superintelligence Team. ""It's got to be for humanity's sake, for a future we actually want to live in. It's not going to be a better world if we lose control of it.""The timing is significant: Microsoft has finally achieved what Suleyman calls ""AI self-sufficiency,"" breaking free from contractual limits that previously capped how large a model the company could train under its landmark OpenAI partnership. That agreement had restricted Microsoft from building systems beyond a certain computing threshold, measured in FLOPS—the number of mathematical calculations an AI model performs per second.Suleyman's alternative vision centers on ""Humanist Superintelligence""—AI that's ""carefully calibrated, contextualised, within limits"" rather than ""an unbounded and unlimited entity with high degrees of autonomy."" He explicitly rejects ""the narrative of the AI race to AGI,"" framing Microsoft's approach as ""a wider and deeply human endeavor to improve our lives and future prospects.""The company is targeting specific breakthroughs: medical AI that achieved 85% accuracy on difficult diagnostic cases compared to 20% for human doctors, personalised education companions, and clean energy innovations.""We are not building an ill-defined and ethereal superintelligence; we are building a practical technology explicitly designed only to serve humanity,"" Suleyman wrote.Suleyman posed the question haunting the industry: ""How are we going to contain, let alone align, a system that is—by design—intended to keep getting smarter than us?"" He added bluntly: ""No AI developer, no safety researcher, no policy expert, no person I've encountered has a reassuring answer to this question.""The executive acknowledged trade-offs in Microsoft's approach, noting ""a key risk is that Microsoft's approach could prove costlier or less efficient than those developed with fewer safeguards."" Still, Suleyman expects it will be ""a good year or two before the superintelligence team is producing frontier models,"" signaling Microsoft is playing the long game.","Mustafa Suleyman: ""We can't build superintelligence just for superintelligence's sake"" Microsoft CEO rejects ""the narrative of the AI race to AGI"" Microsoft has finally achieved ""AI self-sufficiency,"" breaking free from contractual limits.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125239559,imgsize-835698,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman.jpg"

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

The video, uploaded on both his and Stephen Curry’s Instagram on November 10, 2025, showcases a candid, funny interaction between two stars.Curry strolls in with a black hoodie and a backpack, all set to chat like usual. But then he spots Butler. He halts. He narrows his eyes. The confusion shifts to disbelief, and soon enough, he bursts into laughter. Not the soft kind. The loud, doubled-over, can’t-catch-his-breath kind. Text in the clip says “Curry reacts to Jimmy Butler’s new hairstyle,” and it went viral right away. In just a few hours, fans on Instagram and X were sharing, joking, and quoting the moment.The video shared by Stephen Curry on Instagram on November 10, 2025, shows a cozy, fun moment at what looks like a barber shop. Butler is in the chair, getting his hair done into long, wavy locks that remind everyone of his well-known 2023 ""emo"" phase.The stylist is focused on their work while Butler engages in a relaxed conversation.Curry enters the frame wearing a black hoodie and backpack, initially greeting Butler with a friendly ""How you been?"" He pauses, squinting in confusion, before exclaiming, ""I ain't going to lie. What's wrong with you bro? Man a lot."" The realization hits, and Curry doubles over in uncontrollable laughter, pointing at Butler's exaggerated new do. Text overlays in the clip read: ""Curry reacts to Jimmy Butler's new hairstyle! 😂✂️""After seeing this, social media exploded with all sorts of comments like one user on X commented, “The NBA Would Be Better With More Jimmy Butlers In The League...” While another said, “😂 Jimmy look like the lady that design the incredibles costume”.For a long time, Jimmy Butler has been famous for his daring style choices, grabbing attention beyond just the basketball court. In 2023, at the Miami Heat media day, he introduced an 'emo' haircut complete with side-swept bangs and dark eyeliner, leading to a wave of memes and conversations online. The look was so controversial that it became a cultural reference point, and Butler even joked about it in later interviews.In 2022, Butler's newfound dreadlocks gave an added pizazz to his game. These wooden changes are not merely gimmicks, but a reflection of Butler's shameless personality. Following the reveal in 2023 Butler noted to reporters, ""I'm just being me"" - further emphasising how comfortable he is with aquatic life. This last new style in the video cuts back to that ""media day hair"" look (fluffy waves), and most importantly dubbed that ""auntie chic"" style.Butler has always loved trying out different styles. Dreadlocks in 2022. Emo hairstyle in 2023. He’s never been concerned with what’s considered 'normal.' This latest look keeps that vibe going. Loud. Bold.

Turns out, Japan’s streets are so clean that you could practically—or, at least, walk barefoot without regretting it. One Japanese influencer decided to put Tokyo to the ultimate test by strolling around the city in nothing but plain white socks. Yes, socks. Outside. For ten whole minutes.The simple experiment captured the attention of millions online and prompted widespread praise for Japan’s civic responsibility and culture of cleanliness.“One of my favourite countries for this reason,” one user commented, while another wrote, “Try that at 3 am before the trucks come to clean everything. Love Japan they work hard to keep it clean after all the drunk people go home or to their hotels.”""I can’t even wear white socks in my living room without getting them to turn black,"" he added.Tokyo is often cited as one of the cleanest cities in the world despite the absence of public dustbins in many areas. Residents are known to carry their trash home and maintain strict cleanliness habits, reflecting deep-rooted social values rather than strict enforcement.The influencer’s viral test has become symbolic of Japan’s collective civic sense, inspiring global audiences to consider how cleanliness depends more on community behaviour than on infrastructure alone.","Tokyo is often cited as one of the cleanest cities in the world despite the absence of public dustbins in many areas.

Banality of evil: German nurse kills 10 patients,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/banality-of-evil-german-nurse-kills-10-patients-to-reduce-workload/articleshow/125132828.cms,"



It sounds like a line from a Kafka play rewritten by Kafka’s nurse. A man whose job was to ease suffering decided the easiest way to do that was to remove the sufferer entirely.According to a BBC report, a palliative care nurse in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering 10 patients and attempting to kill 27 others. His motive? Not money. Not mercy. Just the mundane — to lighten his workload during overnight shifts.Between December 2023 and May 2024, this nameless nurse — anonymous by law, infamous by act — played God with a syringe. Prosecutors said he injected elderly patients with morphine and midazolam, not to relieve their pain but to make his rounds quieter, his night easier, his burden lighter. He showed, the court heard, “irritation” at those who demanded too much care — as if suffering were an inconvenience on the shift roster.The court in Aachen called it a crime of “particular severity of guilt,” ensuring he will never walk free again. But what’s truly chilling is not just the scale of his actions — it’s their ordinariness. A man trained since 2007 to heal became, by 2024, an executioner in scrubs, armed not with malice but with indifference.Investigators are now exhuming more bodies, probing whether this was just the visible tip of a career-long pattern.If confirmed, he could rival the grim legacy of Niels Högel — the German nurse sentenced in 2019 for killing 85 patients in northern hospitals between 1999 and 2005. Högel wanted to play hero: inject, cause cardiac arrest, then resuscitate — a perverse performance of saviourhood.This new killer? He wanted peace and quiet.That’s the most terrifying part. Evil, it turns out, doesn’t always come snarling. Sometimes it sighs, glances at the clock, and reaches for the morphine. It isn’t ideological or even sadistic — just tired, overworked, and catastrophically devoid of empathy.In that sense, this case isn’t only about a man who murdered ten people. It’s about the slow erosion of compassion in systems that reduce care to shift patterns and metrics. When life becomes data, death becomes a shortcut.Germany has seen this before. It will see it again. Because as Hannah Arendt might have said of this nurse, it wasn’t the devil in him that killed those patients — it was the paperwork.","A palliative care nurse in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering 10 patients and attempting to kill 27 others.

Why the UAE deliberately sank 3 ships: Is it good for the ocean’s ecosystem?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/why-the-uae-deliberately-sank-3-ships-is-it-good-for-the-oceans-ecosystem/articleshow/125237316.cms,"Inchcape 1, sunk off Al Aqah in 2001, has transformed into a thriving marine habitat, attracting divers with its diverse marine life/ Image: vipdivingdubai





The Concept: Artificial reefs for marine life





Inchcape 1: A Diver’s haven in Al Aqah





Inchcape 2: A thriving Reef off Khor Fakkan





Inchcape 10: A marine wonderland in Fujairah





The Impact: Ecological balance and marine conservation

Khaleej Times





Why the UAE deliberately sank 3 ships: Is it bad for the ocIn a unique blend of environmental stewardship and ecotourism, the UAE has deliberately sunk three ships off its east coast, not as an accident, but as a conscious effort to promote marine conservation. The vessels, Inchcape 1, Inchcape 2, and Inchcape 10, have been transformed into thriving artificial reefs that now attract divers from across the world. This innovative approach is a testament to the UAE’s commitment to protecting its natural resources while fostering sustainable tourism.The concept behind sinking these ships is simple yet effective: to create artificial reefs that mimic the role of natural coral reefs in the ocean. Over time, the ships have become vibrant ecosystems, teeming with marine life. These reefs not only support a wide range of fish species but also help to promote biodiversity, offering an underwater experience for divers.The UAE’s efforts are especially significant given the rising threats to ocean ecosystems, including pollution and coral bleaching. The ships, once decommissioned, serve as a reminder that responsible management can help restore marine habitats.Sunk in 2001, Inchcape 1 lies about 32 meters below the surface, off the coast of Al Aqah, Fujairah. Accessible by boat in just five minutes from Al Aqah, this site is recommended for experienced divers, thanks to its depth and complexity. The wreck has turned into a bustling underwater city, home to large schools of red snapper, cardinal fish, and a wide variety of other marine creatures.Divers exploring the site can witness firsthand how the wreck has evolved into a rich marine habitat. Snorkelling and diving equipment are essential to access the site, and the area is becoming a popular spot for eco-tourists looking to experience the UAE’s commitment to sustainable diving.Inchcape 2, intentionally sunk in 2002, rests at a depth of around 22 meters off the coast of Khor Fakkan. It has quickly become one of the most popular dive sites in the region. As the wreck has developed into a thriving coral reef, it now attracts a variety of marine life, including parrotfish, moray eels, small boxfish, and long-tailed rays. The presence of barracudas also adds to the site's allure, making it a must-visit destination for professional divers seeking to explore a healthy and diverse underwater ecosystem.To visit, divers typically embark on a 25-minute boat ride from Al Aqah. Diving equipment is mandatory, and access is managed through licensed diving centers. These centers not only ensure safety but also educate visitors on how artificial reefs contribute to ocean health.Perhaps the most remarkable of the three, Inchcape 10 (formerly known as 'Awaiz') was sunk in 2003. Resting at a depth of about 23 meters off Fujairah, it is one of the largest ships deliberately sunk to create an artificial reef. This site has become a focal point for divers due to its rich biodiversity, including moray eels, barracudas, and other species.Located just an 8-minute boat ride from the Fujairah International Marine Club, the wreck offers an exciting opportunity to explore the wonders of marine life. The site is open year-round, and divers must book through licensed diving centers to gain access. Similar to the other wrecks, the presence of thriving marine life at Inchcape 10 speaks volumes about the success of the UAE’s ecotourism initiatives.Saleh Al-Dhahouri, a diver from Dibba Al Fujairah, has seen firsthand the positive transformation that these shipwrecks have brought to the area. “The diving there is wonderful, a beautiful place, and you couldn't get over the amount of fish and coral,” he said, as told to. He explained that before the ships were sunk, diving opportunities were limited. “With these ships, diving sites have increased, and they have become part of the weekly diving program,” he added, highlighting how these artificial reefs have revitalized local dive tourism.Emirati diver Mintaha Al Shehhi, who specializes in sharks, has been diving in the region for over three years. She praised the ecological balance at sites like Inchcape 2, where frequent sightings of sharks and turtles indicate a healthy environment. “Sharks do not choose random locations, and turtles only pass through when they feel secure and find natural abundance,” she said, emphasizing that the presence of these larger creatures is a sign of a thriving and balanced marine ecosystem.ean’s ecosystem?","The UAE has deliberately sunk three ships off its east coast, not as an accident, but as a conscious effort to promote marine conservation.

"Viral Alert: Dubai's iconic Kunafa Bar creator drops a new golden, halwa-spiced Abu Dhabi Bar",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/viral-alert-dubais-iconic-kunafa-bar-creator-drops-a-new-golden-halwa-spiced-abu-dhabi-bar/articleshow/125222621.cms,"Viral Chef Nouel Catis brings Abu Dhabi a signature chocolate twist / Image Credit: @chefnouel

Meet the creator - Chef Nouel Catis

The new Abu Dhabi Chocolate

The Main Flavor: A harmonious blend of rich salted caramel and traditional halwa (a dense, sweet delicacy).

Emirati Spices: The filling is layered with complex flavors like cardamom and fragrant saffron, giving it instant warmth and depth.

Local Touches: It features authentic ingredients like creamy tahini and sweet date syrup. The chef even notes hints of Balaleet, the sweet and savory Emirati breakfast dish.

Final Touch: To ensure its capital-city status, the bar is lavishly topped with shimmering 24-karat gold flakes.

Where to get the Golden Bar

Exclusive Initial Location: The Abu Dhabi Chocolate bar is initially sold exclusively at Rain Cafe outlets across the UAE.

Wider Delivery: For the brand's other popular flavors (like the Dubai Chocolate), you can often find them available for order on local food delivery platforms like Careem and Talabat in both Dubai and Abu Dhabi.

Price check

Price Range: The Abu Dhabi Chocolate bar is priced at approximately Dh100 (roughly $27 USD) for a 200g bar.

Other Sna'ap Bars: For comparison, the original 90g Dubai Chocolate bars typically sell for around Dh38.

Getting the viral treat outside the UAE

Rely on Travelers: The most common way to get the bars abroad is through friends, family, or colleagues who are traveling from the UAE and can carry them back as a unique souvenir.

Third-Party Shipping Services: Some international fans resort to using re-shipping or concierge services based in the UAE. These services purchase the bar locally and then ship it internationally, though this adds significant cost and is not handled by the chocolate maker itself.

Check Pop-ups: Keep an eye on the official Sna'ap/Chef Nouel Catis social media channels. As the brand grows, they may announce international pop-up events or partnerships that temporarily make the bars available in other countries.

Dubai’s famous Pistachio Crunch

Pistachio-Tahini Cream: A smooth, creamy paste with a deep, nutty Middle Eastern flavor.

Crispy Kataifi: Finely shredded, toasted filo dough, which gives the bar an irresistible, signature crunch (inspired by the famous dessert Knafeh).





If you’ve seen videos of people biting into a thick, crunchy chocolate bar and gasping with delight, you’ve met “Dubai chocolate.” Behind that viral crunch is Filipino pastry chef Nouel Catis, and now he’s turning the idea into new, capital-flavoured treats (think salted caramel + halwa). This is the story foodies want: invention, nostalgia, social-media fame, and a chef turning a trend into a brand you can actually taste.Chef Nouel Catis is a Filipino-born pastry specialist who quietly became the brains behind the original Dubai chocolate, an inventive bar that layers Middle Eastern flavours (pistachio, tahini/kunafa elements) inside a crisp, hollow chocolate shell. His approach mixes childhood memories, heritage ingredients and modern pastry technique to produce a product that looks simple but performs like a theatrical dessert on your palate. His name has since become linked with Sna’ap, his own chocolate brand and pop-up experiences.After conquering the global desert scene with Dubai’s crunchy bar, Chef Nouel Catis is paying homage to the UAE capital with the new Abu Dhabi Chocolate. This bar ditches the pistachio crunch for a flavor profile that is richer, spicier, and truly rooted in Emirati heritage.The Abu Dhabi bar is an ode to local sweets and spices, captured in a thick, luxurious form:Priced around Dh100 for a 200g bar, this is positioned as a truly luxurious, indulgent piece of edible art—initially sold exclusively at local hotspots like Rain Cafe.Because the Abu Dhabi Chocolate is a brand-new, special-edition launch, its availability is currently quite exclusive. The bar is a collaborative effort with a popular local cafe brand.The unique artisanal quality, the luxurious ingredients (like 24K gold), and its status as a viral, limited-edition treat put this bar in the premium category.For fans who want a genuine taste of luxury blended with authentic Emirati flavors, many consider the unique experience a worthwhile indulgence.If you’re a traveling foodie or a UAE resident currently abroad, getting these viral bars requires a bit of planning, as direct international shipping from the cafe is usually not available.If you're active on social media, you've definitely seen the satisfying snap of the viral Dubai Chocolate. Created by Chef Nouel Catis of the Sna'ap brand, this chocolate bar became a global hit because it’s much more than just a sweet treat, it’s a textural masterpiece.The secret to the original bar's obsession-worthy status lies in its core ingredients:This perfect contrast between the rich, creamy filling and the crispy pastry is why foodies worldwide have been trying to recreate this famous UAE-born chocolate.So, whether you're clicking ""add to cart"" via a delivery app in Dubai or hoping a traveling friend brings you a gold-flaked souvenir, one thing is clear: Chef Nouel Catis has successfully merged Middle Eastern heritage with modern indulgence.

UAE records lowest temperature of the season at 9.8°C in Al Ain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-records-lowest-temperature-of-the-season-at-9-8c-in-al-ain/articleshow/125197252.cms,"Raknah, Al Ain recorded 9.8°C Sunday morning, the UAE’s lowest seasonal temperature, NCM confirmed/Representative Image

Today’s cold snap





Historical context





Winter in the UAE





Implications and observations





Daily life: Cooler mornings may require warmer clothing, while daytime conditions remain comfortable.

Travel and tourism: Early-morning temperatures in places like Al Ain and Ras Al Khaimah could affect outdoor activities, especially in desert or mountainous regions.

Agriculture: Frost-sensitive crops in elevated areas might need extra protection during these cold snaps.





The UAE woke up to a chilly start Sunday as temperatures in Raknah, Al Ain, plunged to 9.8°C, the lowest of the season so far, signaling the arrival of winter across the Emirates, the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) reportedAt 6:30am UAE local time, the mercury dropped to 9.8°C in Raknah, Al Ain, marking the coldest reading in the country today. The NCM confirmed this figure, emphasizing that winter in the UAE brings milder conditions compared to the scorching summer months.Typical winter daytime temperatures range between 15°C and 25°C, offering a welcome relief for residents and visitors alike. However, early mornings and elevated areas often experience significantly cooler temperatures.While today’s low is notable, it is far from the UAE’s all-time record. On February 3, 2017, temperatures in the country plunged to -5.7°C at Jebel Jais, the nation’s highest peak located around 25 kilometres from Ras Al Khaimah City. This remains the coldest temperature ever officially recorded in the UAE.For the current year, 2025, the lowest recorded temperature prior to today was 1.9°C on January 4 at Jebel Jais, following a 2.2°C reading the day before. These figures illustrate the pattern of early-morning chills in mountainous areas, even as daytime temperatures remain moderate.The UAE’s winter season, which typically runs from November to March, is characterized by cooler mornings, mild days, and relatively low humidity levels. While daytime temperatures in most urban and coastal areas stay between 15°C and 25°C, residents in desert regions or high-altitude locations may experience sharp dips in temperature overnight, particularly during the colder months.The NCM continues to monitor these fluctuations closely, issuing guidance for residents to prepare for colder mornings and potential weather-related impacts, particularly in elevated or exposed areas.Today’s 9.8°C reading in Raknah is a reminder that while UAE winters are mild compared to many countries, early-morning chills can still be significant, especially in inland and mountainous locations","The UAE woke up to a chilly start Sunday as temperatures in Raknah, Al Ain, plunged to 9.8°C, the lowest of the season so far.

Saudi launches Self-Deportation platform and AI smart track for faster airport immigration processing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/saudi-launches-self-deportation-platform-and-ai-smart-track-for-faster-airport-immigration-processing/articleshow/125178064.cms,"Saudi digitises deportation and travel checks with AI systems / AI-generated image

Deportation goes digital

The platform lets the user submit required exit paperwork and verification online.

Launch timing: the platform will be rolled out “shortly” after technical and security checks are completed (no firm public date was given).

Smart track and AI identity verification

The future of Airport queues

The Smart Track System: This innovative track will allow travelers to pass through immigration controls where their identities are verified solely via advanced smart cameras. Crucially, these cameras are capable of verifying the identities of up to 35 people simultaneously. This unprecedented speed means passengers can complete their entry or exit procedures without needing to interact with a passport control officer, drastically cutting down processing time.

Digital Twins Technology: Tested successfully during the Hajj season of 1445 AH (2024), this system relies on complex models and data analysis. This provides real-time insights into crucial operational metrics, including:



Analyzing crowd movement patterns within terminals. Accurately calculating passenger waiting times at passport control areas. Continuously monitoring passenger satisfaction with the services provided.



The Absher ecosystem

Digital Passport and International Cooperation: The digital passport is already available on the Absher platform, simplifying international travel procedures for beneficiaries. Jawazat is actively working to conclude international agreements with other countries to ensure the acceptance and expansion of this digital passport for global travel.

and International Cooperation: The digital passport is already available on the Absher platform, simplifying international travel procedures for beneficiaries. Jawazat is actively working to conclude international agreements with other countries to ensure the acceptance and expansion of this digital passport for global travel. A Unified Gateway for Data: To improve security and facilitate international transit, the Jawazat has serious plans to establish a ""unified gateway between countries"" for the exchange of passenger data. This system will be secured through formal agreements, ensuring that passenger data is streamlined as soon as they transit through the Kingdom to other international destinations.

Service Accessibility: The Absher platform currently offers more than 100 digital services, which benefited over 24 million users in the year 2024 alone. Jawazat has also introduced the ""Smart Voice Agent"" service, available 24/7 by calling the number 992, providing immediate assistance to users without the need for direct employee intervention.





Acting Director General of Passports (Jawazat), Maj. Gen. Saleh Al-Murabba, announced at the Digital Government Forum 2025 in Riyadh that the directorate will shortly roll out a Self-Deportation Platform to let people who are in the Kingdom illegally complete departure procedures online. He also unveiled a Smart Track system that uses smart cameras and AI to verify identities and process groups of travellers, potentially eliminating the need for routine passport-control staff at some checkpoints.The Self-Deportation Platform is an online portal designed to replace manual, paper-heavy deportation practices. According to the announcement, once security and technical preparations are completed, individuals identified as violators of residency, labour or border rules will be able to access the platform, complete travel documentation and finalise their exit without in-person processing. The move is framed as both an efficiency and a modernisation step, shifting a time-consuming administrative task into a secure digital flow.Key practical points reported so far:Smart Track is the complementary system for major travel hubs. It uses advanced smart cameras and AI technology to check identities and can reportedly verify up to 35 people at once, allowing essential travel procedures to complete smoothly without an individual passport-control officer present.The system aims to efficiently accelerate passenger flow at airports and other checkpoints by intelligently automating identity verification and cross-checking against vital security databases. Officials say the innovative technology will be introduced once integration with Jawazat security systems is fully completedFor travelers passing through the Kingdom’s ports, two major technological leaps are set to eliminate slow-moving lines and long waiting times:Furthermore, departure procedures are being streamlined to a great extent. By linking technical and security systems to smart devices and digital cameras for automated verification, the traditional requirement of passing through passport control at departure lounges will be eliminated, creating a seamless boarding experience.The push for digitalization extends beyond the airport floor and into the wider administrative ecosystem, with the Absher platform at the center of innovation:Saudi Arabia's commitment to these digital reforms, anchored by the launch of the Self-Deportation Platform and the AI-driven Smart Track system, clearly signals a new and transformative era. By transforming its ports into smart, efficient gateways and streamlining administrative services through cutting-edge technology, the Kingdom is solidifying its position as a leader in digital government, ensuring faster travel, seamless security, and a radically improved experience for all who enter or exit its borders.","Self-Deportation Platform to let people who are in the Kingdom illegally complete departure procedures online.

Merchant Registration & Setup: The bank will guide the business through the necessary paperwork and compliance checks to become a registered SIB merchant and set up a digital payments account.



App Provisioning: Once the account is set up, the bank will facilitate the download and activation of the SIB Pay mobile application. This specialized app (likely distributed directly or through controlled links for security) is what enables the Soft POS functionality on any compatible Android device.



Integration Activation: For e-commerce and Pay by Link features, the bank's technical support team will work with the business to integrate the SIB Pay payment gateway into the company's website, mobile app, or invoicing system.



A revolution in customer experience

"UAE debuts VR reconstruction of Makkah and Madina from the Prophet’s era, rendered in amazing detail",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-debuts-vr-reconstruction-of-makkah-and-madina-from-the-prophets-era-rendered-in-amazing-detail/articleshow/125124834.cms,"At Sharjah Book Fair, visitors wearing VR headsets explore ancient Makkah streets and the Holy Kaaba/Representative Image

Reconstructing the streets of ancient Makkah





Witnessing the birth of a community





Madina and the principles of early islam





An educational and emotional experience









Visitors to the Sharjah International Book Fair are now able to experience the heart of early Islam as never before. A new virtual reality (VR) installation, developed by Ana Al Madina, transports participants more than 1,400 years back in time, offering an immersive encounter with the streets, homes, and spiritual landmarks of Makkah and Madina. The experience blends meticulous historical reconstruction with advanced VR technology, allowing users to witness the life, culture, and transformative events of the Prophet Muhammad’s era in vivid, almost tangible detail.The VR journey begins in the very heart of pre-Islamic Makkah, the city of the Prophet’s birth. Participants descend through space before landing in a bustling metropolis, where narrow alleys and open markets unfold around them. Rough stones form the Kaaba, surrounded by the idols that once stood there. Traders sell goods, residents move through crowded streets, and the narration provides insight into daily life, including social norms and the position of women and young girls prior to Islam.The simulation then leads viewers through the early life of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Key moments include his spiritual retreat in the Cave of Hira, where Angel Jibreel revealed the first message of Islam.The visual and auditory elements are designed to create an overwhelming sense of presence, with visitors often instinctively reaching toward the cave walls as if to confirm the reality of the experience.Dr Adil Abdul Qadir, Manager of Ana Al Madina, explained the intent behind the project: “This VR set is designed purely for educational purposes. People who experience it understand what Makkah and Madina were like 1,400 years ago—the culture, the lifestyle, and the way people interacted.”The simulation continues by showing the early Muslim armies forming in Makkah, followed by the city’s transformation after the spread of Islam. These sequences provide both historical context and emotional resonance, culminating in the transition to the modern-day Kaaba. At this stage, users can virtually step inside the Holy Kaaba itself, observing its structure, golden lamps, and the serenity that defines the sacred space. For many, the experience is profoundly moving.“The feeling of watching or experiencing this is amazing,” Dr Adil said. “Many people come out with tears in their eyes because it feels so real, as if they have truly travelled back in time. It helps them understand the message of peace and unity that the Prophet brought.”The VR journey then transports participants to Madina, highlighting the Prophet’s migration and the remarkable construction of Masjid Al Nabawi. Users catch glimpses of his home, community life, and the societal structures he established. The simulation emphasises the core values of early Islamic society: compassion, equality, and justice. Every visual and narrative element is carefully designed to reinforce how these principles shaped both the community and the broader trajectory of Islam.Dr Adil summarised the broader purpose of the project: “This remarkable journey connects people to faith through deep knowledge. We want visitors not just to see history, but to truly feel it, to experience the timeless values that shaped our world.”The Ana Al Madina VR experience represents more than a technological marvel; it is also an educational tool and a profound spiritual bridge. By combining historical accuracy with immersive, narrative-rich storytelling, it allows users to actively engage with the earliest days of Islam in a way that is both intellectually enlightening and emotionally resonant. Visitors leave with a deeper understanding of Makkah and Madina’s rich heritage, the life of the Prophet, and the enduring moral values he imparted throughout history.","Ana Al Madina has created a virtual reality installation at Sharjah International Book Fair.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.





When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification







Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Here are the options available:For those choosing to submit their life certificates online through the Jeevan Pramaan Portal, the following steps are involved:For pensioners opting for offline submission, the process is straightforward:If pensioners fail to submit their life certificates by the stipulated deadline, their pension payments will be halted starting the following month. However, payments will resume once the life certificate is submitted, thereby ensuring that pensioners do not permanently lose access to their funds, provided they complete the required process.In an effort to facilitate the submission process, the Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare (DoPPW) has initiated its third nationwide digital life certificate (DLC) campaign. This campaign runs from November 1 to November 30, covering 800 cities and districts. The campaign aims to promote the use of digital platforms for certificate submission, ensuring greater accessibility for pensioners.On the first day of this campaign, over 1.8 lakh pensioners successfully generated their digital life certificates, highlighting the growing adoption of technology among pensioners. This indicates a positive trend towards digitalization and the effective use of biometric authentication methods.A life certificate is an official document that verifies a pensioner's living status, required annually to continue receiving pension benefits.All pensioners, including family pensioners, must submit a life certificate to maintain their pension payments.Pensioners under 80 must submit their life certificate between November 1 and November 30 each year. Super senior citizens (80 and above) can submit theirs starting from October 1, with the same deadline.If the life certificate is not submitted by the deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting the following month.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online via the Jeevan Pramaan portal, through doorstep banking agents, using biometric devices at post offices, or in person at bank branches.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online by using the Jeevan Pramaan portal and completing biometric verification through designated apps.Yes, pensioners can submit their life certificates in person at their respective banks or post offices.Generally, you will need your Aadhaar number for biometric verification, along with any other identification or pension-related documents as required by your pension disbursing authority.Pensioners can check the status of their life certificate submission through the Jeevan Pramaan portal or by contacting their bank or pension disbursing authority.Yes, if your submission fails, you can reapply and submit your life certificate again using the same methods available to you.",Submission window for 'Jeevan Pramaan Patra' opens for pensioners under 80 with a deadline of November 30. Pensioners can opt to have a bank agent visit them at home to facilitate the submission of their life certificate. This method is particularly beneficial for those with mobility issues.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114942014,imgsize-53514,width-400,resizemode-4/114942014.jpg"
"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

""cold plate""

Amazon Launches Largest Layoff Drive Yet, Cutting 30,000 Corporate Positions to Boost Efficiency

What CEO Andy Jassy said about Amazon’s in-house AI chip cooling system



""Every cloud provider faces the same AI infrastructure challenge: chips need to be positioned close together to exchange data quickly, but they generate intense heat, creating unprecedented cooling demands.

We needed a strategic solution that allowed us to use our existing air-cooled

data centers

to do liquid cooling without waiting for new construction. And it needed to be rapidly deployed so we could bring customers these powerful AI capabilities while we transition towards facility-level liquid cooling.

Think of a home where only one sunny room needs AC, while the rest stays naturally cool – that’s what we wanted to achieve, allowing us to efficiently land both liquid and air-cooled racks in the same facilities with complete flexibility.

The available options weren't great. Either we could wait to build specialized liquid-cooled facilities or adopt off-the-shelf solutions that didn't scale or meet our unique needs. Neither worked for our customers, so we did what we often do at Amazon… we invented our own solution.

Our teams designed and delivered our In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX), which uses a direct-to-chip approach with a ""cold plate"" on the chips. The liquid runs through this sealed plate in a closed loop, continuously removing heat without increasing water use. This enables us to support traditional workloads and demanding AI applications in the same facilities. By 2026, our liquid-cooled capacity will grow to over 20% of our ML capacity, which is at multi-gigawatt scale today.

While

liquid cooling technology

itself isn't unique, our approach was. Creating something this effective that could be deployed across our 120 Availability Zones in 38 Regions was significant. Because this solution didn't exist in the market, we developed a system that enables greater liquid cooling capacity with a smaller physical footprint, while maintaining flexibility and efficiency.

Our IRHX can support a wide range of racks requiring liquid cooling, uses 9% less water than fully-air cooled sites, and offers a 20% improvement in power efficiency compared to off-the-shelf solutions. And because we invented it in-house, we can deploy it within months in any of our data centers, creating a flexible foundation to serve our customers for decades to come.

Reimagining and innovating at scale has been something Amazon has done for a long time and one of the reasons we’ve been the leader in technology infrastructure and data center invention, sustainability, and resilience. We're not done… there's still so much more to invent for customers.""

Most-popular iPhone analyst Ming-Chi Kuo on why Elon Musk is moving Tesla’s AI chip supply chain away from TSMC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/most-popular-iphone-analyst-ming-chi-kuo-on-why-elon-musk-is-moving-teslas-ai-chip-supply-chain-away-from-tsmc/articleshow/125222730.cms,"Elon Musk’s chip Timeline: AI5 to AI6 in under a year



Why Tesla is moving away from TSMC

Geopolitical risk: Musk has publicly voiced concerns about the concentration of advanced node capacity in Taiwan. Even by 2030, TSMC’s advanced-node and advanced-packaging capacity in the U.S. will remain limited—especially on the packaging side, likely no more than about 10% of its global capacity. I believe Musk realizes this as well, which is why he said, 'And then you go to solve memory and packaging too.'

R&D flexibility: It's expected that Tesla has significant growth potential, but within TSMC today it is still a second-tier customer relative to the likes of Apple and Nvidia. That naturally means less priority on R&D support and production flexibility—one of the main reasons Tesla moved AI6 to Samsung. The ultimate remedy is to control its own chip production plant.

Vertical integration: Musk's new technologies and products are often at the cutting edge. The ability to customize key design and manufacturing segments to his specific needs—with chip production being a critical one—enables a highly integrated final product and maximizes the benefits of vertical integration.

Tesla’s AI chip ambitions







Ming-Chi Kuo, the popular Apple analyst has validated his earlier predictions. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Kuo said that Tesla CEO Elon Musk pushed to build Tesla’s own semiconductor fabs marking a strategic shift towards full control of the company’s AI future. The comments made by Kuo follow Musk’s remarks at Tesla’s recent shareholder meeting, where Musk outlined the aggressive roadmap for Tesla’s next-generation AI chips. “@elonmusk remarks at the latest Tesla shareholder meeting validate my previous analysis and predictions regarding his semiconductor strategy,” wrote Kuo.At the shareholders meeting, Elon Musk said, ““I’m hopeful that we can within less than a year of AI5 starting production, we can actually transition in the same fab to AI6 and double all of the performance metrics.” In a post shared on X, Kuo said that this statement made by Musk confirms his earlier analysis that Tesla is escalating its chip development timeline. While many doubted Tesla could move from AI5 to AI6 in just a year, Musk’s confidence supports the notion that Tesla is building the infrastructure to do just that. “I previously projected that AI6 would enter mass production in 2027. Many questioned whether only a one-year gap between AI5 and AI6 was realistic, but Musk’s comments validate that timeline (setting aside whether the plan ultimately executes as stated),” wrote Kuo.As per Kuo, Musk’s motivation to build Tesla’s own chip plants goes far beyond concerns about supply shortages. Kuo suggested three strategic drivers:Kuo referenced a past comment from TSMC CEO CC Wei, who told Musk: “If you’re willing to pay, there will be chips.” This, Kuo argued, shows that supply isn’t the issue—control is.The A15 chip of Elon Musk’s Tesla is said to be produced by both Samsung and TSMC. However, Musk has also hinted that the uture chips like AI6 and AI7 may be built in Tesla’s own fabs. He even teased AI8 as “out of this world,” suggesting a long-term roadmap of increasingly powerful processors.“Just finished a long AI5 design review with the Tesla California and Texas chip engineers. It’s going to be great,” Musk wrote. He then revealed the subsequent schedule: “And AI6 and AI7 will follow in fast succession. AI8 will be out of this world.”","Ming-Chi Kuo, the popular Apple analyst has validated his earlier predictions.

The paradox of cheaper AI



The big picture







When OpenAI’s CFO Sarah Friar used the word “backstop” while talking about AI funding, the internet panicked. People thought she meant a government bailout like the 2008 financial crisis. In reality, she was just referring to long-term support for big infrastructure projects.But the reaction showed one thing: most people have no idea what it actually costs to build artificial intelligence at today’s scale — or why those costs sound so huge.Building a large AI model isn’t like creating an app or a website. It’s more like building a national power grid or railway system — massive, complicated, and expensive at the start. Three things make up most of the bill: compute (chips), energy (power), and data (training material).To train a large AI model, companies need tens of thousands of high-end chips called GPUs. The most popular is Nvidia’s H100, which costs around $25,000–$35,000 each. A model like GPT-5 may use 20,000–50,000 of them. That means just the chips alone cost between $1 billion and $2 billion. Add networking, cooling, and servers, and the total crosses $2 billion before training even begins.Each GPU uses about 700 watts of power. Multiply that by tens of thousands, and you get 40–50 megawatts — the same as a mid-sized Indian town.One month of training can cost $5–10 million in electricity. And that doesn’t include cooling costs to stop the chips from overheating.Training data sounds free, but it’s not. You can’t just use random internet content. AI companies need massive, clean, and legally approved datasets — text, images, audio, and video. Creating and storing such data can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. GPT-4’s dataset alone reportedly cost over $100 million. For multimodal AI (which handles video and sound), the cost will be several times more.Add in hundreds of highly paid engineers and scientists, and it’s easy to see how a single training run can cost $2.3–$4 billion.That sounds shocking, but history shows it’s completely normal.Every new technology starts off insanely expensive The high cost of AI today isn’t unusual. Every major technology began as a financial nightmare — and then became cheap and essential. Railways: Britain’s first intercity rail line in 1830 cost £17 million (in today’s money). Investors called it madness. Within decades, costs dropped by 70%, and rail became the backbone of modern transport.: Edison’s first power station in 1882 served only 59 customers at a cost of $9–10 million. Electricity was 40 times more expensive per unit than it is today.The first transatlantic cable cost £1 million and failed after three weeks. But as technology improved, message costs fell from hundreds of dollars to just cents.In the late 1990s, telecoms spent $100 billion laying fibre. Many went bankrupt. Yet within a decade, costs dropped 99%, and fast internet became cheap and universal.Early chip factories cost $100 million. Today’s advanced ones cost $25 billion, but each produces chips worth hundreds of billions over time.The Apollo moon mission cost $25 billion in the 1960s ($257 billion today). That research helped bring down rocket launch costs by more than 90%.The pattern is always the same: Version One is absurdly expensive. Then efficiency, competition, and scale make it cheap.So, how will AI follow the same path? Every expensive part of today’s system — hardware, power, data — already has a roadmap for cost reduction.Right now, Nvidia dominates the GPU market, so prices are high. But competitors like AMD, Google (TPU), Amazon (Trainium), and Intel (Gaudi) are changing that.As more players enter, margins will shrink and costs will drop 20–30%. Specialised chips (ASICs) and “sparse” models that use fewer active components at a time can further cut compute costs by up to 90%.Energy makes up 15–20% of AI costs. But data centres can move to cheaper power locations — hydro in Quebec, geothermal in Iceland, or wind in Texas. That alone cuts costs by half or more.New cooling systems like liquid or immersion cooling also make servers more efficient, cutting power use by another 20–30%.High-bandwidth memory (HBM) is expensive because only a few suppliers dominate the market. New designs and competitors will lower those costs by 30–50% in the next few years.AI labs currently waste up to 40% of their computing power due to poor scheduling. Better job management and “model distillation” — teaching smaller models to behave like large ones — can halve training costs.Future models will also use “continual learning,” updating existing systems instead of retraining from scratch.Running AI models (known as inference) is expensive because it scales with use. But using smaller, optimised models, caching common answers, and switching to specialised chips can reduce inference costs tenfold.AI companies are learning that smaller, cleaner datasets perform better than massive, messy ones. Synthetic data — generated by AI itself — can cut costs by up to 90%.Together, these changes could bring down AI’s total cost threefold within two years, tenfold within five, and up to fiftyfold over a decade.So why not make AI cheaper immediately? Because some parts of the system move at physical speed, not digital speed.Building chip factories takes years. Constructing data centres or new power plants can take a decade. Even when alternatives to Nvidia exist, switching software ecosystems takes time. You can’t speed up steel, silicon, or regulation. But the direction is clear. Every major constraint — from chip supply to energy to data — is being solved. Slowly, but steadily.Even when AI gets cheaper, companies may still spend just as much — or more. This is called the Jevons paradox: when something becomes cheaper, people use more of it. As costs fall, AI will spread everywhere — from hospitals to classrooms to entertainment. The total spending will stay high, but the cost per use will drop dramatically. That’s why OpenAI’s CFO talked about “backstopping” — not to ask for bailouts, but to plan long-term funding for what’s effectively a new industrial revolution.AI today is expensive, loud, and energy-hungry. But that’s how every new technology begins. Over time, competition and efficiency will bring costs down just like they did for railways, electricity, and the internet. The truth is simple: the most expensive AI we’ll ever build is the one we’re building right now. Each new generation will be faster, cheaper, and more normal — until one day, we’ll wonder why it ever seemed expensive at all.","Most people have no idea what it actually costs to build artificial intelligence at today’s scale. Three things make up most of the bill: compute (chips), energy (power), and data (training material) To train a large AI model, companies need tens of thousands of high-end chips.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125221961,imgsize-31218,width-400,resizemode-4/openai-cfo-sarah-friar.jpg"
