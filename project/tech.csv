Vande Bharat Sleeper: Top Features

Vande Bharat sleeper launch soon! Indian Railways is all set to launch its first Vande Bharat sleeper this week, with PM Narendra Modi expected to flag off the new train on January 117 between Howrah and Kamakhya (Guwahati). Ahead of the launch, Indian Railways has announced the fare structure and ticket prices for the Vande Bharat sleeper train.Built specifically for overnight travel and long-distance routes, the Vande Bharat sleeper is a fully air-conditioned trainset developed in-house by Indian Railways. These trains are intended for routes spanning roughly 1,200 to 1,500 kilometres, catering to passengers travelling across states during night hours.For the Vande Bharat Sleeper service, Indian Railways has set a minimum chargeable distance of 400 km for fare calculation.During test runs on the Kota–Nagda section, the Vande Bharat sleeper achieved its designed top speed of 180 kmph. One of the highlights of the trial was a stability demonstration in which glasses filled with water remained steady without spilling, even at speeds exceeding 180 kmph.Although the train is designed for semi-high-speed operations of up to 160 kmph in regular service, trials have been conducted at 180 kmph.Actual operating speeds will depend on the condition and capability of tracks on different sections of the network.The sleeper version is designed as the long-haul, overnight counterpart to the Vande Bharat chair car services currently operating across India.Drawing inspiration from European rail design, the sleeper coaches feature cushioned berths for improved comfort and redesigned access to upper berths for easier movement.Passenger amenities include soft night lighting, integrated audio-visual passenger information systems, CCTV surveillance and modular pantry units.The trains will be equipped with aircraft-style bio-vacuum toilets, including facilities for persons with disabilities, baby care areas and shower units with hot water in the first-class coach.Safety systems include the indigenous KAVACH anti-collision technology, while regenerative braking will be used to enhance energy efficiency, similar to existing Vande Bharat chair car trains.Additional features include sealed gangways and automatic inter-coach doors to maintain air quality and cabin temperature, along with personal reading lights, charging points, foldable snack tables and interiors finished with GFRP panels.Train doors will open automatically at designated stations. A centralised coach monitoring system and emergency communication facilities will allow passengers to directly contact the locomotive pilot when necessary.","Vande Bharat sleeper will have 11 AC-3 tier coaches, 4 AC-2 tier coaches and one AC First coach.

India has the world's only floating national park: Know its location,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/travel/india-has-the-worlds-only-floating-national-park-know-its-location/articleshow/126498802.cms,"AI - generated



Keibul Lamjao: World’s only floating national park in Manipur

Endangered animals depend on this floating park

Nature draws visitors to Keibul Lamjao National Park

How and when can you visit the floating park





Keibul Lamjao National Park, located in Manipur ’s Loktak Lake, holds a distinction unmatched anywhere else in the world. It is the only national park that rests entirely on floating vegetation, rather than fixed land. The park is formed on phumdis, thick natural mats of soil and plant matter that rise and sink with changing water levels. This unusual setting supports a fragile ecosystem and serves as the last natural habitat of the endangered Sangai deer. Though remote, the park has become a point of scientific and conservation interest due to its dependence on the health of the surrounding lake. Water management, climate patterns, and the careful balance between protection and human activity closely shape Keibul Lamjao's future.The base of Keibul Lamjao is made of phumdis, which are thick, layered masses of vegetation. They form naturally when plants decay and bind together with soil and roots. Over the years, these mats grow strong enough to support grasses and reeds, and eventually animals. They drift slightly with changes in water level, lifting during the monsoon and settling lower in drier months. This movement is slow, almost unnoticeable, but it shapes everything above it.Unlike solid ground, the surface feels alive. The health of the park depends on Loktak Lake itself. When water flow changes, the phumdis change too. This fragile balance is why the park is considered unique and also why it remains vulnerable to human interference beyond its boundaries.The most well-known resident of Keibul Lamjao is the Sangai deer. With its slender legs and curved antlers, it moves lightly across the phumdis, almost testing each step. Once believed to be extinct, the species survived only here, hidden within the floating grasslands. Its presence is tied closely to the condition of the park. Alongside the Sangai, smaller populations of hog deer are found, as well as otters that slip quietly through the water channels. Birds arrive and leave with the seasons. Some stay; others pass through during migration. Their calls fill the early mornings, then fade by afternoon. None of these animals could exist here without the lake, and none could survive if the phumdis were to disappear.People come here less for spectacle and more for atmosphere. There are watch towers where visitors stand and wait, often longer than expected. Mist moves across the lake in the early hours, hiding and revealing shapes without hurry. When a deer appears, it does not perform. It grazes, lifts its head, and moves on. Boats cut slowly through narrow channels, careful not to disturb the floating ground. The landscape feels open yet contained, quiet but not empty. There are no marked trails in the usual sense, because the land itself shifts. What stays with many visitors is not a single sight, but the sense of standing somewhere that does not quite behave like land or water, but something in between.The park is about 45 kilometres from Imphal, the capital of Manipur. Most visitors arrive by air, then continue by road towards Loktak Lake. The best months to visit are between November and March, when the weather is cooler, and water levels are more stable. During the monsoon, the lake swells and restricts movement, making access difficult. Local guides are important here, not only for navigation but also for understanding what can and cannot be done on floating ground. Rules are strict, and for good reason. Keibul Lamjao is not built to absorb pressure. It holds together quietly, as long as it is allowed to. When the day ends, the lake settles again, carrying the park with it.","Keibul Lamjao National Park is located in Manipur ’s Loktak Lake.

Northern lights may drift across US skies this week: Know where to spot them,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/northern-lights-may-drift-across-us-skies-this-week-know-where-to-spot-them/articleshow/126418902.cms,"Northern lights may drift across US skies this week: Know where to spot them

Which US states are most likely to see the Nothern lights this week

Washington

Montana

North Dakota

South Dakota also falls well within the viewing zone for this event.

Can people farther south see anything at all

What is causing this aurora event

Clouds and city lights change the experience





Northern skies do not usually proclaim themselves. Most nights are calm, even when something faraway moves above the earth. This week is little different. A pulse of solar activity is travelling across Earth's magnetic field, and this change could be enough to bring the northern lights into view in portions of the United States. It is not guaranteed, and it will not appear the same everywhere. Some people may notice a gentle tint on the horizon, while others may see nothing. However, for a brief period in early January, the odds shift somewhat. Space weather forecasters and sky watchers are keeping a tight eye on the darkness, hoping it may reveal something unexpected rather than being empty for once during the harshest stretch of winter evenings.The strongest chances sit far north, as they usually do. Alaska remains the most reliable place, almost separate from the rest of the map when it comes to aurora watching. Parts of:These areas lie closer to where Earth’s magnetic field funnels charged particles into the atmosphere. NOAA forecasts suggest activity could peak overnight between January 8 and January 9, though timing often slips by hours. In these states, the lights may form brighter arcs or slow-moving curtains rather than faint smudges.Even then, nothing is promised. Auroras are known for appearing briefly and fading without warning.States just below the typical aurora belt are not completely out of luck. Minnesota, Michigan, and Maine frequently find themselves on the verge of a moderate geomagnetic storm, and this week may be no exception. The exhibit in these sites is typically understated. Colours may appear washed out, closer to grey than green. It frequently remains low in the northern sky, easily mistaken for a cloud or distant glow. Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire, and sections of New York fall under the same category. Seeing the aurora typically requires patience and expectations on the part of viewers. Many who do notice it do so only later, when images reveal more than the naked eye could see at the time.The trigger comes from the Sun, though not in a dramatic, cinematic way. A coronal mass ejection has sent a stream of charged particles outward, interacting with a co rotating interaction region already moving through space. Together, they disturb Earth’s magnetic field just enough to produce a G1-level geomagnetic storm. That rating is considered minor, but minor does not mean invisible. It simply means effects are more local and less intense. Space weather remains difficult to predict with precision. Solar wind speed, density, and direction can all shift suddenly. Forecasts improve as the storm arrives, but uncertainty never fully disappears.Even the strongest aurora means little under thick cloud. Cloud cover remains the biggest reason people miss these events, regardless of solar activity. Clear skies matter more than most other factors. Light pollution is the next obstacle. Urban lighting can wash out faint auroras entirely, especially in southern locations. Rural areas, coastal stretches, and dark sky parks offer better odds. Many experienced observers suggest letting your eyes adjust and avoiding phone screens for a while. Cameras often see more than humans do, especially in low light modes. Sometimes the night still looks empty. Sometimes it does not. That uncertainty is part of the pull.","The strongest chances sit far north, as they usually do.

How to delete your OpenAI account: Step-by-step guide



Step 1: Open the ChatGPT App menu

Step 2: Open settings

Step 3: Navigate to data controls

Step 4: Initiate account deletion

Important notes about subscriptions



What happens after account deletion



You will no longer have access to all OpenAI services, ChatGPT, and API resources.

Your account information will be deleted within 30 days, except where required by law.

There is no possibility of opening a new account through the same email.

Best practices before deleting your account



Back up important data: Save conversations, files, or notes you want to keep.

Subscription Cancellation: Avoid extra charges by canceling all subscriptions currently active on the account.

Linked services: Look at the application that is connected with your OpenAI account; update credentials for those if necessary.

These steps, if taken, can achieve a smooth transition without any sort of uncalled-for data or financial loss.





OpenAI accounts are a means for customers to use the ChatGPT API and other similar services. If you want to cancel further use of OpenAI’s services, you can delete your account using the ChatGPT Android App. Nevertheless, note that if you delete your account, you will not be able to reverse the process since account deletion is a permanent process that cannot be undone. On the other hand, you will not be able to use a similar account for the same email when you delete the account, since OpenAI will delete account data within 30 days, apart from data that needs to be kept for a certain period based on a law requirement.Deleting an account needs to be done with care, and more so when you use active subscriptions from the Google Play Store. Deleting the account does not mean you will stop the subscription process because you need to do this manually.Deleting the OpenAI account ensures that your personal information cannot be found on the OpenAI servers. This basically covers chatting logs, personal preferences, API-usage data, as well as any other piece of information that may be connected to the account.It is worth noting that this process cannot be reversed. Once you delete the account, you cannot get the information back, nor can you use the same email for a new account sign-up process, since that account would not exist any longer.Deletion of accounts also matters in the context of privacy and data. In certain cases, legal obligations might force OpenAI to retain specific data even if the account has been deleted. Users are advised to monitor the OpenAI blog for updates in the privacy policy.Now, moving on and starting with removing the ChatGPT application from your Android mobile phone, you should first open the application. For this purpose, you should tap on the two horizontal lines available at the top left corner of your application interface.On the menu, look for your profile icon located at the bottom of the page. To access the Settings page, click on the three dots icon positioned to the left of your name. The Settings page provides the functionality to manage your account-related settings, which include things such as security, subscriptions, and personal details.Within the Settings area, scroll down until you see the Data Controls section. This particular section of the Settings area is specifically geared towards allowing users to take control of their information. You can opt to delete your account and other data-related settings.In Data Controls, select Delete Account. A confirmation modal will appear, warning you about the permanence of this action. Carefully review the information provided to understand that this will remove all access to OpenAI services and delete your data within the prescribed period.Once you are sure, click Delete Account in the confirmation modal. OpenAI will then schedule your account for deletion.If you had any kind of subscription, such as for ChatGPT Plus, from the Google Play Store, you have to cancel that separately before deleting the account, as account deletion does not cancel any subscriptions automatically. If you do not, you may end up getting billed for a subscription you no longer have an account for. OpenAI has given a set of instructions on how to cancel a subscription, which you must do before you delete your account.After the completion of the deletion process:Active subscriptions have to be individually cancelled in order to prevent recurring payments. Knowing these consequences would ensure you know whether to proceed or not before closing your account.Best practices before you begin deleting:","Deleting an account needs to be done with care, and more so when you use active subscriptions from the Google Play Store.

Rockstar Games bans Grand Theft Auto missions linked to Charlie Kirk’s assassination: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/rockstar-games-bans-grand-theft-auto-missions-linked-to-charlie-kirks-assassination-report/articleshow/126517204.cms,"Grand Theft Auto mission linked to Charlie Kirk’s assassination removed

Why Rockstar Games removed Charlie Kirk missions





Rockstar Games has reportedly banned user-created missions in Grand Theft Auto Online that recreated the assassination of Charlie Kirk. According to a report by Variety, the company has also added the term “Charlie Kirk” to the list of restricted words used by its internal content-filtering system. Further, Rockstar plans to rename the content filtering tool from the existing “profanity filter,” to a better term that reflects its broader purpose. The system is used to flag and block content the company does not want players to introduce into the game, including references to real-world events such as the Kirk assassination, not just offensive language.Kirk, a 31-year-old conservative artist and co-founder of Turning Point USA was killed on September 10, 2025 during a college event in Utah. His assassination sparked widespread political debate in the country, including discussions around gun laws and media commentary.In December, Rockstar Games introduced a new feature in GTA online that allows players to create and publish their own mission. After the launch, the feature was used by many players to create missions linked to Kirk’s death. These user-generated missions instructed players to use a sniper rifle to kill a character named Charlie Kirk.online videos of the mission showed players positioned on a rooftop overlooking a scene resembling Kirk's assassination.One such mission was titled “We Are Charlie Kirk,” that was later removed by Rockstar.In another news, Rockstar is currently working on “Grand Theft Auto 6,” the next main title in the franchise, which is scheduled for release on November 19, 2026. A Bloomberg report recently said that the developers of the highly-anticipated game are still finalising levels, missions and determining which features will ultimately make the final cut – essentially suggesting that the game is not yet “content complete”. Speaking on the Ringer-Verse's Button Mash podcast, Schreier noted that the current development cycle mirrors that of Rockstar’s previous blockbuster, Red Dead Redemption 2.""This is a big and complicated game,"" Schreier explained on the Ringer-Verse's Button Mash podcast, adding that he wouldn’t be ‘super shocked’ if the delay happens again.“This time around, this is a big and complicated game, and the last I heard, it was still not content complete. That is to say that people were still finishing things up, still finalizing levels and missions, and seeing what's going to make it into the game,” he said.GTA 6 has already witnessed two delays since the game's record-breaking first trailer debuted in late 2023.","Rockstar Games has reportedly banned user-created missions in Grand Theft Auto Online that recreated the assassination of Charlie Kirk.

During time in Italy, he documented personal growth and design work, stressing the project is driven by passion, not branding. The brand’s first release will be a journal sharing his creative process.

Kai Cenat Breaks Silence On Mental Health In Powerful 24th Birthday Message

Kai Cenat uses Twitch hiatus to build something bigger behind the scenes

I Quit





Kai Cenat remained quiet weeks before and had left fans guessing. Following the stress of the marathon intensity of the Mafiathon 3, the Twitch star appeared to disappear, suggesting burnout or even retirement. However, there was no turning back to creativity at Cenat, behind the apparent calm. He was redirecting it.As Cenat continued to stay silent on his Twitch channel, he slowly turned his attention elsewhere. The absence was deliberate. Out of the limelight he delved into something new, more leisurely, and very personal. He did not pursue numbers but got bent on growth, contemplation, and art. That option is now coming into sight.The first clue arrived subtly. At the end of a recent main-channel upload, Cenat revealed a second YouTube account called Kai’s Mind. The channel is intentionally understated. No hype. No algorithms chased. Just raw documentation. Viewers see workouts, reading practice, and early sewing sessions. The oldest video dates back to December 25, 2025, and the low view counts suggest it was never meant to go viral.That secrecy connects directly to his newest venture. During extended time in Italy, Cenat immersed himself in fashion production, visiting facilities and learning how ideas become products.This was not a casual interest. As he explained, “This is the first time I’ve had a passion for something besides content creation.” He later added, “This is not me sticking my name on a brand and money-grabbing,” making clear his intent to build something real.The result is Vivet, a fashion brand rooted in personal meaning. Vivet translates to “will live” in Latin, which Cenat views as a statement about evolving beyond one identity. The brand’s first release will be a journal that includes sketches, concepts, failures, and wins, offering fans a transparent look at the process.Cenat also revealed the symbolism behind the Vivet logo, known internally as ET3. “If you can see deeper, it’s an infinity symbol and a cross. I just wanted to add that to my flair.”For now, there is no firm launch date. What is clear is this. Kai Cenat did not disappear. He recalibrated. And this chapter is about intention, not noise.Also Read: “Supposed to be a secret”: Creepy 140-year-long YouTube upload is unsettling the internet for one chilling reason"," Twitch star Kai Cenat has revealed a secret YouTube channel called Kai’s Mind.

Dubai’s Palm Monorail halts service indefinitely: 5 best alternative routes to get around Palm Jumeirah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubais-palm-monorail-halts-service-indefinitely-5-best-alternative-routes-to-get-around-palm-jumeirah/articleshow/126484934.cms,"Dubai Palm Monorail Suspended Indefinitely for Maintenance: 5 Best Alternative Routes You Need to Know

Palm Monorail: From iconic connector to maintenance standstill



Israel On HIGH ALERT As Trump ‘FINALISES’ US Attack On Iran Amid Bloody Khamenei Crackdown | Watch

What’s behind Palm Monorail's closure?



Extended maintenance resulting in major upgrades to stations, track infrastructure or vehicle systems.

Partial reopening first, serving select peak hours or routes before full reinstatement.

Integration with future transit plans, potentially tying to expanded urban transport networks like the Dubai Metro Red Line extensions (long-term conceptual plans have discussed broader connectivity between the Palm and mainland transit)

Dubai commuters adjust with alternatives



Taxis and Ride-Hailing Apps (Fastest and Most Convenient): Best for tourists, families, hotel guests, short stays, taxis remain the most direct and time-efficient option to reach hotels, beach clubs and attractions across Palm Jumeirah. They are widely available across Dubai with drop-off directly at Atlantis, The Pointe, Nakheel Mall and hotels. They are ideal during hot weather or peak tourist season. Tip: During weekends and evenings, allow extra time due to traffic at Palm entry points. RTA Buses (Budget-Friendly Option): Best for budget travellers and daily commuters, Dubai’s public buses continue to serve Palm Jumeirah and nearby areas. Bus routes connect Palm Gateway with Dubai Tram and Metro stations, have affordable fares using Nol cards and are reliable but slower than taxis. Tip: Expect longer travel times during peak hours, especially in winter tourism season. Dubai Tram and Taxi Combination (Balanced Option): Best for visitors staying near Dubai Marina or JBR, take the Dubai Tram to Palm Jumeirah Gateway and switch to a taxi for internal Palm travel. This option balances cost and convenience, especially for those already near tram routes. Private Cars and Hotel Shuttles (Most Flexible): These are best for residents, long-term visitors and hotel guests. Many hotels on the Palm offer complimentary shuttle services. Private cars allow flexibility but can face congestion at peak times. Parking is available at major attractions like Atlantis and Nakheel Mall. Tip: Check hotel shuttle schedules in advance to avoid waiting times. Water Transport (Scenic, Limited Availability): Best for leisure travellers, some operators offer water taxis and private boat services connecting the Palm with Marina or mainland Dubai. These are scenic and relaxing with limited routes and schedules but are typically more expensive than land transport

Key advice for travellers

Re-evaluate peak-day plans to allow extra travel time across Palm Jumeirah.

Use taxis or buses from Palm stations to reach Atlantis, Aquaventure and other attractions.

Check official social channels frequently, as operators have pledged to update passengers once service resumes. Follow official Palm Monorail channels for reopening updates.

Plan extra time for Palm journeys during weekends and evenings.

Check hotel transport options before booking taxis.

If visiting Atlantis or Aquaventure, taxis remain the simplest option





Dubai’s iconic Palm Monorail, the first monorail in the Middle East and a key people-mover on Palm Jumeirah Island, has suspended operations indefinitely for essential maintenance work, leaving locals and tourists alike in transit limbo as the route connecting the Palm to the mainland remains closed with no confirmed reopening date. The announcement came via the monorail’s official channels, with operators confirming that station maintenance is the reason behind the service stoppage. While riders and commuters await updates, alternative transport like taxis, buses and private vehicles have become the de facto way to traverse the popular destination.The Palm Monorail, which first opened in April 2009 and runs approximately 5.45 km across the famed Palm Jumeirah to Atlantis Aquaventure Resort, has served residents, hotel guests and visitors for over 16 years. Designed as a scenic and efficient link across the inland portion of the man-made island, it features four stations and was operated by UK-based transport firm Serco.This suspension marks one of the most significant disruptions to the fleet since its launch and critically, there is currently no timeline for service resumption. While the monorail has historically played a niche role in the city’s broader transit ecosystem (with other heavy traffic handled by road vehicles and the Dubai Metro), it has nonetheless been a memorable part of the Palm experience, often recommended by guides and included in visitor itineraries.According to official statements and travel reports, the shutdown is due to ongoing station maintenance across the monorail network. The operators emphasised that this maintenance is vital to ensure long-term efficiency and safety. It is a necessity for infrastructure nearing two decades of operation.However, there are no published details about the scope, duration or specific technical issues being addressed and a reopening date has not been announced. The lack of a firm timeline has caught many by surprise, including frequent riders and tourists planning visits during Dubai’s peak travel months.For tourists, the monorail was not only functional but scenic and offered elevated views of the Palm trunk, fronds and skyline beyond. Its absence removes one of the region’s most visually distinctive transport experiences, with many visitors now questioning whether a Palm Jumeirah visit will feel less complete without it.Dubai’s transport ecosystem continues to accommodate tens of thousands of daily commuters via roads, ferries, the Dubai Metro and buses, but the monorail’s suspension, especially without a reopening timeline, has created a sense of uncertainty for travel planners and local enthusiasts alike. Unlike typical ride or track refurbishments in theme parks or transit systems worldwide, where scheduled closures often come with reopening forecasts, Dubai’s monorail maintenance appears to be in a more fluid or potentially extensive phase.For instance, other major attractions that undergo periodic maintenance (such as aerial tramways elsewhere) often announce specific closure windows and reopening dates well in advance. The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway in California, for example, closed for its annual maintenance and clearly communicated both start and reparative timelines months before reopening.By contrast, the Palm Monorail closure has only been explained as a maintenance necessity, with no estimated timeline distributed so far. It is a situation that could hint at deeper or more unpredictable engineering work underway. There are a few possible scenarios for the Palm Monorail’s future:While operators have not issued such updates, Dubai’s dynamic urban growth suggests that transport infrastructure will continue to evolve, and the monorail, as a symbolic and strategic asset, may yet be refashioned to play a renewed role once technical work is complete.With Dubai’s Palm Monorail suspended indefinitely for maintenance, residents and visitors heading to Palm Jumeirah will need to rely on alternative transport options. Here’s a simple guide to the fastest, easiest and most practical ways to move around the Palm while the monorail remains out of service.Though these options maintain mobility, riders have noted longer transit times, especially during rush hours or high-season tourism peaks. Some social media users have expressed frustration at the lack of clarity about when the monorail might return, underscoring how the system is valued both as transport and as a leisure experience.For visitors planning Dubai itineraries in early 2026, the monorail closure means:The Palm Monorail, a once-celebrated urban transport highlight, is out of service for essential maintenance with no reopening date yet. The closure underscores both Dubai’s commitment to long-term safety and the challenges of sustaining ageing transport systems in a rapidly growing city.Though seemingly minor in the grand scheme of Dubai’s transport network, the monorail’s indefinite suspension stands as a reminder that iconic infrastructure sometimes needs serious upkeep and that even world-class cities must balance maintenance demands with high expectations from residents and visitors alike. While the Palm Monorail remains closed with no reopening date announced, Palm Jumeirah is still fully accessible.Taxis and buses are currently the most reliable alternatives, while tram links and hotel shuttles help bridge the gap.

Kuwait extends newborn registration window to 120 days for Civil IDs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/kuwait-extends-newborn-registration-window-to-120-days-for-civil-ids/articleshow/126478222.cms,"Kuwait increases time limit to 120 days for baby registration / AI Illustration

Kuwait newborn registration 2026

Deadlines for citizens and expats

Kuwaiti Citizens: Must register within 30 days of returning to the country.



GCC Citizens: Have a 30-day window from the date of their arrival in Kuwait.



Expatriates: Must complete registration within 30 days of obtaining their residency permit.



Penalties for missing deadlines

Fines: Penalties for non-compliance range from KD 2,000 to KD 3,000.



Settlement Options: In some cases, a settlement can be reached by paying KD 100 plus an additional KD 5 for every day of delay (capped at KD 2,000).







Welcoming a new member into the family is a whirlwind of joy, sleepless nights, and, inevitably, paperwork. In a major move to support families, Kuwaiti authorities have officially extended the deadline for registering newborns in the national civil information system. New parents now have a generous 120-day window to complete their baby’s registration, a significant shift designed to ease the administrative burden during those precious first months.The update comes directly from Sheikh Fahad Al-Yousef, the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior, who also chairs the Public Authority for Civil Information (PACI). Under the new ministerial decision, the registration period for children born inside Kuwait has been pushed to four months from the date of birth.This change amends long-standing regulations to better reflect the logistical realities of modern parenting. By providing more time, the government aims to ensure that every child is documented accurately without forcing parents to rush through legal procedures while still recovering from childbirth or adjusting to a new routine.While the extension for newborns is the headline news, it is important to note that other registration deadlines remain strict. The Civil Information System serves as the backbone of Kuwait’s administrative data, and the Ministry of Interior maintains clear timelines for other categories of residents:These rules ensure that the national registry stays up to date, which is crucial for everything from healthcare planning to the distribution of public services.While the government is making the process more flexible, they are also getting tougher on those who ignore the law entirely. Recent legislative updates highlight that neglecting a child's documentation is no small matter. Failing to add a child to official nationality files or civil records can result in heavy financial hits:Authorities emphasize that these measures are about more than just bureaucracy; they are a commitment to child protection and the preservation of national identity. Ensuring a child has a Civil ID from the start guarantees their access to essential rights, including education and healthcare.This extension is part of a broader ""digital-first"" push in Kuwait. By streamlining how families interact with PACI and the Ministry of Health, the State is making it easier for citizens and residents to stay compliant. Parents are encouraged to utilize the Sahel app and other online portals to track their applications and ensure all document, such as attested marriage certificates and passports, are ready well within the new 120-day limit.","Kuwait has extended the deadline for registering newborns in the national civil information system.

Coup In Britain? Starmer’s ‘Own Cabinet Plots’ His Downfall | ‘Full Bunker Mode’ In No. 10





The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true. ""The UK is set to introduce a nationwide curfew, beginning at 11pm each night,"" he appears to say on one of thousands of TikTok videos of him posted in last six months. ""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok. By Dec 19, most appeared to have been removed from the platform. Howard said the use of AI in politics is increasing rapidly. ""We know it's internationally pervasive now,"" he said. ""Four of every five elections around the world now have AI-generated political junk that is unattributed and clearly misleading.

Ask Dhirendra: 'How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/mutual-funds/ask-dhirendra-how-do-i-decide-how-much-to-save-and-invest-when-my-income-is-just-about-enough/articleshow/126072787.cms,"The problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

If you have any queries for Dhirendra Kumar you can drop us an email at: toi.business@timesinternet.in

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Rule #2: Go big with the right collaborations

Rule #3: Tell your story with courage



Chris Do at Dubai’s Billion Followers Summit

Why Chris Do's principles matter now more than ever



Know who you are before asking others to know you.

Choose collaborators who elevate your voice.

Tell your story boldly, beautifully and authentically.





At Dubai’s Billion Followers Summit, the world’s biggest event for digital creators, one of the leading voices in branding and design took to the stage with a clear message that in a crowded digital world, being different is not optional but essential.Chris Do, CEO and Founder of The Futur, a global creative education platform followed by millions, shared his top principles for content creators aiming to build a distinctive identity in an era where anyone with a phone can publish content. His session titled “How to Stand Out in a Noisy World” was one of the highlights of the fourth 1 Billion Followers Summit 2026 in Dubai, an event drawing tens of thousands of creators from around the world under the theme “Content for Good. ”Do’s first principle is deceptively simple: define precisely what you want before trying to build a public persona. In his view, clarity of intent serves as a magnetic force. Once you know your destination, your work naturally aligns with opportunities and audiences. Without that clarity, creators risk mimicking others and blending into the noise.“Don't expect everyone to know you. Instead, you should focus on building a distinctive personality that people will recognise.To build this distinctive personality, there are a number of assets or principles. The first is to define precisely what you want because if you do that, you will find that life organises things for you until you achieve what you want,” Do told the packed audience.The underlying idea here is that identity precedes audience, not the other way around. When creators are consistent in what they stand for, others are far more likely to gravitate toward them, not because their content is everywhere but because it matters somewhere. This kind of intentional positioning builds both followers and loyalty.Next, Do emphasised that the creators who want to make a mark should not shy away from associating with big names in their niche. Rather than playing it safe in isolated corners of the internet, ambitious creators should actively pursue collaborations with people, brands or platforms that already embody excellence in their field.This is not about ego or branding theatrics, it is about strategic visibility. When you align yourself with recognised authorities, your own voice gains credibility by association. For many content creators, the smartest next step is not more posting; it is more worthwhile partnerships.The third and most human of Do’s principles centres on storytelling. For a creator to stand out, audiences must first know you before they engage with what you create. In a world where trends and memes come and go, a creator’s unique story becomes their lasting currency.Do urged creators to have the courage to show opinions that differ from the mainstream, even if they seem strange or unconventional. However, he also stressed that difference must be meaningful, not different for the sake of attention. Authenticity, he argued, is the glue that connects form and substance, bold ideas with beautiful presentation.If your aesthetic and your values align, people don’t just follow you; they remember you. His point reflects a wider industry shift: audiences increasingly reward truth and depth over polished mimicry.Do’s session came against the backdrop of the 1 Billion Followers Summit’s explosive growth. With over 30,000 attendees, 15,000+ creators and 500+ expert speakers from around the world, the event underscores the creator economy’s evolving complexity and influence.As traditional media models continue to shift, with millions of videos uploaded daily and users spending hours on social platforms, creators are discovering that follower counts alone no longer guarantee success. The goal is no longer only visibility but distinctive influence and lasting connection. This idea is echoed by other speakers at the summit, who have urged creators to think beyond virality and focus on purpose, responsibility and real impact in their craft.For aspiring creators and seasoned influencers alike, Do’s framework offers a roadmap out of content fatigue and into meaningful growth:These principles are not tricks or shortcuts; they are foundations for a digital identity that withstands trends and algorithm changes, transforming creators from noise makers into distinctive voices in the global conversation. In a world where anyone can become a creator overnight, enduring influence is built not by copying what’s popular but by defining what’s you. As Chris Do put it in Dubai: clarity, collaboration and courageous storytelling are not just nice to have, they are the keys to standing out in an increasingly crowded world.","Chris Do, CEO and Founder of The Futur, shared his top principles for content creators aiming to build a distinctive identity in an era where anyone with a phone can publish content.

Posters, paperwork and early marketing

A wide-ranging collection of Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings and some of Apple’s earliest products has gone up for auction as the company approaches its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2026. The sale is being handled by RR Auction, which has opened bidding on 191 items spanning Jobs’ early life and Apple’s formative period in the mid-1970s.Among the centrepieces of the auction is the first known cheque issued by Apple Computer, Inc. on March 16, 1976. Signed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, the $500 cheque was made out to Howard Cantin, who designed the printed circuit board for the Apple-1 computer. The document predates Apple’s official incorporation and is described by the auction house as a foundational artefact from the company’s earliest days.Also drawing strong interest is the earliest known prototype motherboard for the Apple-1, alongside other rare hardware from Apple’s pre-Macintosh era. Early bidding has already pushed some items into the tens of thousands of dollars, with expectations that final prices could climb far higher.The auction also includes a functional Lisa-1 computer, a key transitional machine that preceded Apple’s Macintosh line, as well as a first-generation iPhone that was later jailbroken by teenage hacker George Hotz.Together, the items trace Apple’s evolution from a garage-based start-up to a consumer electronics giant.Adding a more personal dimension, the collection features items from Jobs’ childhood and teenage years, provided to the auction house by his stepbrother, John Chovanec. These include bowties, Bob Dylan 8-track tapes, and the wooden desk from Jobs’ bedroom at the Los Altos, California home later associated with the famed “Apple garage”.Other personal effects include components from Jobs’ own Apple-1 computer, hand-annotated car repair manuals, and a short handwritten note to his father on an early Apple business card.Rounding out the auction are original Apple marketing posters from the 1970s and 1980s, along with internal documents and ephemera from the company’s earliest phase. Together, the items offer a rare, material record of Apple’s origins and the personal world of its co-founder.Bidding for the collection is open until January 29, with interest expected to grow as the anniversary year approaches.","Collection of Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings and some of Apple’s earliest products has gone up for auction as the company approaches its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2026.

How rent increase limits are calculated in Dubai



0% increase: If your current rent is up to 10% below the market average

5% increase: If it’s 11% to 20% below average

10% increase: If it’s 21% to 30% below average

15% increase: If it’s 31% to 40% below average

20% increase: If it’s more than 40% below average

Step-by-step: How to check if your rent increase is legal in Dubai



Visit the official DLD Rent Index page on the Dubai Land Department website. Enter your Title Deed number or manually key in your property details (area, number of rooms, contract expiry date and current annual rent). The tool calculates the average rent for similar properties nearby. It then shows the maximum legal rent increase allowed under the index bands.

What to do if your Dubai landlord demands too much



Present the official index result to the landlord in writing or via email.

Negotiate based on the legal maximum rather than the landlord’s figure.

File a complaint with the Rental Dispute Centre (RDC) at the Dubai Land Department, where the index can be used as statutory evidence to challenge unfair increases.

Bottom line: Rent transparency in Dubai







As Dubai’s rental market continues to evolve amid strong demand and population growth, tenants often grapple with rising rents and the question: Is this rent increase even legal ? Fortunately, the Dubai Land Department’s Smart Rental Index, an AI-powered official tool, now gives residents a clear way to check whether a rent hike proposed by a landlord is justified under UAE law.Whether you are renewing your lease, debating negotiations or simply planning your budget, understanding how rent hikes are regulated in Dubai is essential. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how the system works and how tenants can protect themselves from arbitrary increases.At the core of Dubai’s rent regulation framework is the Smart Rental Index, a sophisticated tool developed by the Dubai Land Department (DLD) to determine fair rental values across the emirate. Unlike the older system, which was updated annually by broad district averages, the Smart Index uses AI and detailed building-level data, including construction quality, services, maintenance standards and location, to produce real-time average rent figures for specific buildings and neighbourhoods.The index covers all residential areas of Dubai, including freehold communities and leasehold zones and helps both tenants and landlords benchmark rental rates against current market conditions.Under Dubai’s tenancy laws (including Decree No. 43 of 2013 and subsequent DLD regulations), landlords cannot arbitrarily raise rent each year. Instead, rent increases are permitted only during lease renewal and only if the Smart Rental Index supports the hike.Importantly, landlords must also provide tenants with a written notice at least 90 days before the expiry of the tenancy contract if they wish to raise rent or change any contract terms. Failing to provide this notice makes the increase invalid under the law, even if the index allows it.These rules are designed to promote market transparency and protect tenants from sudden, excessive rent hikes that could destabilise household finances.Dubai’s rent increase system sets strict limits on how much landlords can legally increase rent, based on how the tenant’s current rent compares with the average market rent shown in the Smart Rental Index -These bands help ensure that rent adjustments are fair and reflect genuine market trends rather than landlord discretion. They are automatically applied by the Smart Rental Index tool when you perform a legal rent check.Tenants in Dubai can easily verify whether a proposed rent increase complies with the official rules by using the online rent calculator provided by the Dubai Land Department:You can access this service via the Dubai REST app, the DLD website under e-services or the DubaiNow app, all of which provide the same official data. Once you have the result, you can print or screenshot the official calculation to use in negotiations with your landlord or, if needed, as evidence in a dispute.If your landlord proposes a rent increase that exceeds the legal limit shown by the Smart Rental Index or fails to give the mandatory 90-day notice, you have options:Tenants have successfully used this process to keep their rent at current levels when the index shows no increase is allowed, demonstrating the tool’s effectiveness.Even if the Smart Rental Index shows your rent qualifies for an increase, the landlord must still serve at least 90 days’ written notice before your tenancy expires. If they don’t, the increase is invalid by law and your rent must remain unchanged for the next contract period.This dual requirement, both index eligibility and timely notice, protects tenants from both unjustified and procedural rent hikes.The Smart Rental Index is not just a protective tool for tenants, it also helps landlords justify their pricing based on clear market data. This transparency can reduce conflicts and support fairer negotiation at renewal time.For tenants, the benefits are clear:For landlords, it standardises expectations and aligns increases with actual market trends, supporting sustainable rental growth across Dubai’s diverse property landscape.Dubai’s Smart Rental Index and the associated legal framework give tenants a powerful and free way to verify whether a rent increase is fair and lawful. Using the official online calculator and understanding the rules around notice periods and permissible increases allows renters to protect themselves from arbitrary hikes while helping landlords set rents that reflect genuine market data.With rent increases now a standard concern for tenants across the emirate, knowing how to use the Smart Rental Index could save tenants thousands of dirhams and reduce rental disputes. It is not just about checking numbers, it is about ensuring fairness, transparency and legal compliance in one of the world’s most dynamic rental markets.",Dubai’s rent increase system sets strict limits on how much landlords can legally increase rent.

According to popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple’s own AI server chips are said to enter the mass production phase in the second half of 2026. Kuo also highlighted that the company is also planning to start building and operating its own data centres in 2027. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Kuo wrote, “Apple’s self-developed AI server chips are expected to enter mass production in 2H26, and its own data centers are expected to begin construction and operation in 2027, which may indicate that Apple anticipates significant growth in on-device AI demand starting in 2027.”For long Apple has relied on its own in-house silicon team to differentiate its products. From the A-series Chips in iPhones to the M-series processors in Macs, Apple’s the custom designs created by the company have consistently delivered performance and efficiency gains. Recently, the tech giant also shipped its own cellular modems (C1 and CX) and wireless connectivity chips (N1). The move into AI server-class chips is seen as a natural extension of this strategy, giving Apple tighter control over the infrastructure powering its AI services.- 2026: Mass production of Apple’s AI server chips begins.- 2027: Apple’s new data centers expected to go online, scaling AI workloads.- Short term: Chips may be deployed in existing data centers on a smaller scale before full rolloutApart from this, Kuo also shared his thoughts on the recently announced partnership between Apple and Google. he iPhone maker confirmed it's teaming up with Google to use Gemini models as the foundation for a smarter, more capable Siri arriving later this year. ""After careful evaluation, we determined that Google's technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,"" Apple said in a joint statement with Google.Talking about the partnerships Kuo wrote, “Two short-term challenges in Apple developing its own AI, which force Apple to collaborate with Google:(1) This year’s WWDC AI demonstration cannot afford to fail again.(2) User expectations for AI service quality have risen with the development of cloud AI. Even if Apple fulfills its past promises regarding Apple Intelligence and Siri, it now seems insufficient, so stronger on-device AI models are needed.”",Apple's own AI server chips are said to enter the mass production phase in the second half of 2026. Apple is also planning to start building and operating its own data centres in 2027.

"Quote of the day by Jensen Huang: “I very seldom fire people, I’d rather torture them to greatness”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/quote-of-the-day-by-jensen-huang-i-very-seldom-fire-people-id-rather-torture-them-to-greatness/articleshow/126489810.cms,"NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang

“I very seldom fire people, I’d rather torture them to greatness.”

NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang's leadership philosophy on firing and performance



How NVIDIA’s work culture reflects Jensen Huang’s management style



Why Jensen Huang believes discomfort leads to growth



How employees and observers interpret the quote



What Jensen Huang’s quote really says about leadership







When NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang talks about leadership, he doesn’t reach for the usual corporate language. One of his more striking lines is,It sounds odd at first. A boss talking about “torture” rarely lands in polite conversation. But the meaning becomes clearer when you look at how Huang explains what he actually does with his teams. He doesn’t mean cruelty. He means pushing people to grow, learn, and reach a point they might not reach on their own. It’s a style of leadership rooted in belief rather than abandonment. Huang has said he prefers to help people improve instead of simply letting them go when things get tough. He frames this as a belief in potential, a view grounded in his own journey from humble beginnings to the helm of a global tech giant.This quote taps into a broader discussion happening in workplaces today about talent, resilience, and how leaders cultivate performance. Huang’s words are often described as tongue in cheek, yet they point to a real approach many executives wrestle with: should you cut losses and fire someone who’s struggling, or invest time and effort in helping them rise? In Huang’s view, that investment can pay off in unexpected ways.Huang has repeatedly said that firing is not his first instinct. He sees it as a last step, not an early one. In interviews, he has explained that when someone is underperforming, the more important question is why. Is the role wrong? Is the support missing? Is the feedback unclear? His response is usually to lean in, not step away.That approach has shaped NVIDIA’s internal culture. Expectations are high. Feedback is direct. People are expected to learn fast and adapt. Huang believes that struggling inside a demanding environment often teaches more than being comfortable in an easier one. His quote about “torture” reflects that belief. It is about sustained challenge, not humiliation or fear.He has also said that if he hires someone, it means he already believes in their potential. Walking away from that too easily would mean questioning his own judgment. So instead, he stays engaged and pushes for improvement.NVIDIA is widely known as a demanding place to work. Employees have described long hours, intense deadlines, and constant pressure to deliver. At the same time, many stay for years. Compensation, stock rewards, and the chance to work on cutting-edge technology all play a role.Huang’s leadership style is closely tied to that environment. He has said that meaningful work is rarely easy. Progress, especially in advanced computing and artificial intelligence, comes from sustained effort and repeated failure. Teams are expected to confront problems directly, not avoid them.This is where the quote often gets misunderstood. Huang is not celebrating burnout. He is describing a belief that growth happens under pressure, and that leaders should help people through that pressure instead of replacing them at the first sign of difficulty.Huang has spoken openly about discomfort being a teacher. He believes that moments of frustration often come right before breakthroughs. If leaders remove pressure too soon, they may also remove the chance for real learning.In his view, coaching is not about being gentle all the time. It is about being honest. That can mean telling someone their work is not good enough, then staying with them while they fix it. It can mean repeating feedback until it finally lands. That process is hard. For both sides.The phrase “torture them to greatness” sticks because it captures that tension. Growth is rarely smooth. It usually involves moments when quitting feels easier. Huang believes leaders should not make quitting the default option.Reactions to Huang’s words are mixed. Some admire the clarity. Others question whether this level of pressure works for everyone. That debate is common in tech, especially in companies growing as fast as NVIDIA has in recent years.What is clear is that Huang’s quote reflects how he actually operates. NVIDIA’s rise as a dominant force in AI and computing did not happen through cautious leadership. It came from aggressive goals, constant iteration, and teams pushed to deliver more than they thought possible.At its core, this quote is not about suffering. It is about commitment. Huang is saying that he would rather invest time, energy, and effort into developing people than discard them quickly. That choice comes with pressure, discomfort, and high expectations. But it also comes with trust.Not every leader works this way. Not every workplace should. But in Huang’s case, the words align closely with the results and the culture he has built. The quote stands out because it is unpolished, honest, and a little unsettling. Which is often how real leadership conversations sound when they are not filtered for comfort.","Jensen Huang, CEO of tech giant NVIDIA, said he would rather torture people than fire them.
