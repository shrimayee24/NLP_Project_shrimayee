Cardi B Turns Her Umbilical Cord Into GOLD!

More coverage on Cardi B and Stefon Diggs:

The placenta forms an extraordinary bond between mother and child, with the umbilical cord as their lifeline of silent conversation. When the baby arrives, the placenta follows, marking the end of this quiet connection. For nine months, mother and baby shared unspoken messages through this remarkable link, only to part with it at birth. But what if that connection could last a lifetime? That is probably the vision behind Mommy Made Encapsulation, a service that allows mothers to preserve their placenta forever. Such preservation was chosen by Cardi B , partner of New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs The couple recently welcomed a baby boy into their lives. Following the heartfelt tradition, she began with her third child, daughter Blossom, in October 2024, the Grammy-winning rapper chose to honor her fourth child with Diggs in November 2025 in a similar way. She entrusted Mommy Made Encapsulation to transform her pregnancy journey into cherished keepsakes, capturing the memorable moments when her baby was still growing inside her. The company crafted a heart-shaped gold pendant from the baby’s umbilical cord and turned the placenta into nourishing vitamins to support her post-partum recovery.Curious about how the gold pendant comes to life? The process begins with careful cleaning of the placenta, followed by a wash with blue dye that highlights its unique texture.After another rinse, the technician gently separates the placenta from the umbilical cord. The cord, now a striking blue, is shaped around a heart-shaped metal ring, with any extra length trimmed away. Finally, the piece is dipped in shimmering gold chrome, transforming it into a gleaming keepsake. The company describes it as a way to honor the first bond between mother and child. According to the company’s website, “The umbilical cord keepsake is your baby’s umbilical cord dehydrated in the shape of a heart and then dipped in gold chrome. The end result looks and feels like metal and is the perfect way to honor the first connection you shared with your baby.” It costs $50.The “AM I THE DRAMA?” creator took things a step further by having her placenta turned into vitamin capsules. That’s not all. She also tried something called a Placenta Print. The process starts with cleaning the placenta and dyeing it blue to look like a tree. Then, a sheet of paper is pressed on top to make the company’s signature Placenta Print, which costs $65. Their website explains that the print is made by painting the placenta with food-grade coloring (one gets to choose the colors) and stamping it onto a 12-by-18-inch poster to create a Tree of Life painting. After the print is made, the placenta receives a fresh rinse before its transformation into capsules begins.The website explains that the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) method is used, with careful steaming at 220 degrees F for 30 minutes to ensure safety. Bacteria and viruses cannot survive at temperatures higher than 131 degrees F. The placenta is gently steamed in specially designed steaming bags made up of heat-resistant, FDA-approved nylon, safe for cooking and free of BPA. Once steamed, the placenta is dried, ground into a fine powder, and sealed into capsules.Each placenta yields 160-180 pills, which, when taken regularly, can offer many benefits for new mothers, such as increased energy levels, reduced post-natal bleeding, lesser chance of baby blues, balanced mood and hormone levels, increased milk supply, lesser chance of post-partum depression, higher iron levels, uterus returning back to pre-pregnancy size faster, losing baby weight faster, and enhanced bonding experience with the baby. The capsules are available in a variety of flavors, including strawberry, orange, bubblegum, lime, berry, grape, and a vegan option. According to the website, these capsules never expire. They just need to be kept at room temperature and in a dry place. The pills can be taken with other medications. The cost of encapsulation starts at $500. This never-heard-before ritual has even captured the curiosity of stars like Megan Fox and Vanessa Hudgens , who, like Cardi B, have embraced the trend of creating placenta keepsakes.",The Grammy-winning rapper entrusted Mommy Made Encapsulation to transform her pregnancy journey into cherished keepsakes.

Common mistakes when restoring old photos with Google Nano Banana Pro

There is something magical about rediscovering an old, worn photograph. The soft yellows, the creases, the fading edges and the stubborn scratches hold stories that feel too precious to lose. Until recently, restoring these photos required hours of painstaking manual editing. Now Google Nano Banana Pro has made that process far easier. With the right prompts and a bit of creative direction, you can revive portraits, repair damage, and bring lost details back to life in a way that looks natural and polished. Whether you are working with a family album or a treasured vintage snapshot, this tool gives you professional level results with far less effort.Google Nano Banana Pro uses advanced diffusion modelling and context-aware reconstruction. In simple terms, it analyses each pixel, predicts missing details and rebuilds textures so the restored image looks authentic rather than overly sharpened. It also understands lighting, skin tones, shadows and colour balance, which makes it one of the most reliable tools for repairing vintage portraits. Instead of plastic-looking edits, you get subtle, human-like restoration that respects the original photo.The model also handles very damaged images. Torn edges, fold marks, grainy patches and faded backgrounds can be reconstructed automatically. For photos from the 70s and 80s, which often have tinted colour casts, the tool balances hues without making the image look artificial.Using this model effectively comes down to guiding it with clear prompts. Here are prompt structures that work well for damaged or faded photos:“Restore this old photograph with natural colours, clean details and accurate lighting. Remove scratches, stains and noise while keeping the original style.”“Reconstruct the face gently, retain natural skin texture, preserve original expressions and repair damaged areas without over-smoothing.”“Neutralise yellow tint, improve contrast, balance highlights and shadows, and restore film-like tones.”“Rebuild missing or torn sections, reconstruct textures, recover facial features accurately and maintain the vintage feel of the image.”You can also add extra artistic instructions such as “keep grain minimal” or “retain film quality”. The more specific you are, the more consistent the results.To ensure your restored photos look natural, keep these expert guidelines in mind:It is tempting to eliminate all grain, but older photographs naturally have texture. Leave a little grain to maintain the vintage character.For very old family photographs, match the restored colours with reference images from that era. For example, mid-century colour palettes often used softer reds and muted greens.Shadows anchor a photograph. If you remove too many shadows or highlights, the restored image may look flat. Let the model repair damage, but keep the original lighting structure intact.While the model handles most reconstruction automatically, sometimes background objects can appear too clean. Adjusting the prompt to “preserve background imperfections” can solve this.Many beginners make the error of giving vague prompts like “fix this photo”. This causes incorrect smoothing, unnatural facial features or oddly bright colours. Another mistake is using portrait prompts for landscape images, which can distort objects. Over-sharpening is also common, resulting in a digital rather than vintage look. Always compare the original and restored versions side by side to ensure the emotional tone remains the same. This helps you refine edits, preserve important details, and maintain the original atmosphere that gives the photograph its distinctive authenticity.Photo restoration is more than fixing pixels. It is a way of honouring memories that might otherwise fade. With Google Nano Banana Pro and the right prompt strategy, you can bring old pictures back to life while preserving their history and charm. A few careful edits and a well-structured prompt are often all it takes to rebuild details, refresh colours and revive treasured moments. If you have a box of old photographs waiting to be restored, this tool is a gentle and precise way to begin.","Google Nano Banana Pro uses advanced diffusion modelling and context-aware reconstruction.

Warren Buffett’s $4.3 billion Alphabet investment signals a direct challenge to Nvidia’s lead in AI chips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/warren-buffetts-4-3-billion-alphabet-investment-signals-a-direct-challenge-to-nvidias-lead-in-ai-chips/articleshow/125506567.cms,"Google’s AI chips may be shifting the balance of power

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

A shifting competitive dynamic, but not a dethroning

Google trains and serves Gemini models on TPU infrastructure.

Google Cloud is offering Ironwood TPUs to customers as part of its cloud platform.

Companies such as Anthropic have announced plans to use up to one million Google TPUs, citing performance and cost considerations.

What Buffett’s investment likely signals

Implications for the AI chip race





When Berkshire Hathaway revealed a new multibillion-dollar stake in Alphabet, most observers initially viewed it as another major addition to Warren Buffett’s long-term portfolio. Yet the timing and strategic context suggest the investment could be more than a routine allocation. The world’s most influential value investor has chosen to back Alphabet at a moment when the company is strengthening its control over the hardware that underpins advanced AI systems.For nearly a decade, Alphabet has been developing its own artificial intelligence chips, known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). In November 2025, the company announced general availability of its seventh-generation Ironwood TPU, describing it as designed for demanding AI workloads, including large-scale model training and high-volume inference. This announcement was made publicly on Google Cloud’s official blog, where the company highlighted lower costs and improved performance for AI developers.Most AI labs still rely heavily on Nvidia’s high-performance GPUs.These GPUs remain the industry’s gold standard, but they are extremely expensive and often in short supply. This has created bottlenecks for AI companies that depend entirely on Nvidia for compute capacity.Google is in a unique position. By designing its own chips, running its own data centres and integrating its hardware into products such as Gemini and Google Cloud, Alphabet gains levels of efficiency that many competitors cannot match without years of hardware investment. Analysts and industry researchers have suggested that TPU-based training may offer meaningful cost advantages compared to traditional GPU-heavy infrastructure, although exact ratios vary and are not always publicly disclosed.Buffett’s investment therefore can be understood not as a claim that Alphabet has overtaken Nvidia, but as confidence in Alphabet’s vertically integrated approach to AI. By controlling more of the stack, Alphabet potentially insulates itself from the price swings, supply constraints and dependence that characterise the GPU market.Nvidia remains the clear leader in AI chips and maintains a robust ecosystem of developers, tools and software support. Google’s TPUs represent a serious alternative in some workloads, but not a full replacement for GPUs across all use cases.The publicly available evidence shows:These developments suggest that the AI compute market may become more competitive. However, they do not confirm that Nvidia’s dominance is definitively weakened. Instead, they indicate that Alphabet is emerging as a strong hardware contender in a market previously dominated by a single supplier.Berkshire Hathaway’s disclosed stake in Alphabet was valued at approximately US$4.3 billion at the time of the filing. The filing does not state Berkshire’s motives. However, investors and analysts widely agree that Buffett’s approval of such a large position indicates confidence in Alphabet’s long-term strategy, including its growing emphasis on efficient AI infrastructure.Buffett has consistently favoured companies with durable advantages or “moats.” Alphabet’s traditional moats have included Search, YouTube and Android. In the AI era, Google’s control over its own chip design and cloud hardware may represent an additional moat that differentiates it from rivals.This does not imply that Google is attempting to dismantle Nvidia’s leadership. Instead, it suggests that Alphabet is building the capability to operate more independently in an AI-driven future, and that this capability may strengthen its competitiveness in cloud computing and AI services.The next phase of AI is likely to be shaped by which companies can train and deploy models most efficiently. If Google Cloud attracts more third-party training due to cost, performance and availability, it could gradually shift cloud market dynamics. Nvidia will remain central to the ecosystem, but Google’s TPU ecosystem adds a new dimension to the competition.Buffett’s investment amplifies the narrative that companies with deeper control over hardware, software and data will hold significant advantages in the years ahead. Alphabet is signalling that it intends to be such a company.The takeaway is clear: this is not the end of Nvidia’s dominance, but it may be the beginning of a more competitive era in AI hardware.","Alphabet has been developing its own artificial intelligence chips, known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) In November 2025, the company announced general availability of its seventh-generation Ironwood TPU. By designing its own chips, running its own data centres and integrating its hardware into products such as Gemini and Google Cloud, Alphabet gains levels of efficiency that many competitors cannot match.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125506558,imgsize-36812,width-400,resizemode-4/warren-buffetts-43-billion-alphabet-investment-signals-a-direct-challenge-to-nvidias-lead-in-ai-chips.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year.

China building nuke-proof floating island: Mega project has 2028 deadline; what will it be used for?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-building-nuke-proof-floating-island-mega-project-has-2028-deadline-what-will-it-be-used-for/articleshow/125490383.cms,"Representative AI image

A look into the project



Where will it be located







China has reportedly begun constructing a massive floating artificial island designed to withstand a nuclear strike, a project that signals a major escalation in the global race for maritime power. Chinese state-linked researchers describe the structure as a new “mega science infrastructure,” underscoring Beijing’s push to expand its strategic capabilities at sea.The 78,000-tonne semi-submersible twin-hull platform is described as the world’s first mobile, self-sustaining artificial island.“We’re racing to complete the design and construction, aiming for operational status by 2028,” Lin Zhongqin, an academician leading the project, was quoted as saying in an interview with Economic Information Daily in April last year.The structure is reported to have a displacement comparable to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy’s new Fujian aircraft carrier and can accommodate up to 238 personnel for four months without resupply. When operational in 2028, it is expected to offer extended endurance and significant reach across contested waters, as cited by the South China Morning Post.However, behind its scientific purpose is a nuclear-blast-resistant design that, according to researchers associated with the project, employs “metamaterial” sandwich panels engineered to absorb catastrophic shock waves and reduce them to manageable pressure.“This deep-sea major scientific facility is designed for all-weather, long-term residency,” the research team led by Professor Yang Deqing of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) noted in a peer-reviewed research paper.Its superstructure also reportedly houses essential systems for emergency power, communications and navigation control, making nuclear blast protection for these areas crucial.According to design contracts signed in December 2024 between Shanghai Jiao Tong University and China State Shipbuilding Corporation, the platform will span 138 metres in length and 85 metres in width, with its main deck positioned 45 metres above the waterline. Its twin-hull structure is engineered to operate in sea state 7 conditions, featuring waves up to nine metres, and to withstand typhoons rated as high as category 17, the strongest classification for tropical cyclones.Unlike fixed stations or ships constrained by fuel and supplies, the platform can travel at 15 knots while supporting more than 100 researchers engaged in continuous deep-sea observation, equipment testing and seabed resource studies.The facility also signals China’s push to advance its “blue economy” agenda, including deep-sea resource extraction, marine renewable energy and climate research.The facility is expected to operate in areas that may include contested waters such as the South China Sea , a region rich in untapped mineral resources and biodiversity.Although presented as a civilian project, it references GJB 1060.1-1991, a Chinese military standard for nuclear blast protection, indicating potential dual-use objectives, as cited by the Daily Mail.","The 78,000-tonne semi-submersible twin-hull platform is described as the world’s first mobile, self-sustaining artificial island.

Fire engulfs the Pavilion



A tourist’s negligence



Officials launch investigation





A fire broke out in a sacred temple in China, reportedly due to a tourist’s careless handling of ceremonial candles and incense. On 12 November, the flames consumed most of the three-storey Wenchang Pavilion in Zhangjiagang, Jiangsu province. No casualties were reported.Dramatic footage of the fire engulfing the wooden structure has gone viral on the internet. The video shows thick black smoke pouring into the sky as large sections of the roof collapse and crash to the ground. The sound of cracking timber can be heard as the fire tears through the wooden framework.According to the local authorities, a tourist's negligence resulted in the fire. Preliminary findings indicate that the tourist’s ‘irresponsible candle use’ and clumsy incense handling led to the wooden structure going up in flames. Officials noted that the blaze originated directly from the careless lighting ritual.Local officials confirmed that firefighters responded quickly to the emergency and managed to bring the fire largely under control by the afternoon. The swift action prevented the blaze from spreading beyond the temple to the surrounding forest area. Fortunately, there were no injuries or fatalities.The temple, commissioned in 2008 and built the following year, is located on the beautiful Fenghuang Mountain.The pavilion is managed by the nearby Yongqing Temple. The original building stood for centuries, and the current structures were reconstructed in the 1990s after the originals were lost. It contained no ancient relics.The authorities have confirmed that further actions will be taken as the investigation progresses. Officials said that they will “pursue accountability” based on the findings. The temple will be strengthening its safety measures to minimise future fire risks. Restoration work will begin once the probe is complete.As the video went viral on the internet, netizens expressed their concern. An X user noted the importance of improving the safety of such structures. “This is a call to value and safeguard our ancient treasures before it’s too late,” the user wrote. “I am so sad to see it go up in flames; it looks like a very beautiful building, and I hope they rebuild,” wrote another. “Tragic for such a beautiful historical building to burn down,” a third commented.","A fire broke out in a sacred temple in China, reportedly due to a tourist’s careless handling of ceremonial candles and incense.

What is “Ahlīyatuk”?

Funded by Zakat: Uniquely, the program’s funding comes primarily from Zakat, the mandatory Islamic charity, ensuring that the support is distributed to those determined to be truly deserving.

A Safety Net with a Ladder: Unlike old welfare systems, this new structure focuses on rehabilitation, training, and employment. The system categorizes beneficiaries and implements empowerment plans to help those able to work transition from reliance on aid to becoming productive contributors to the economy.

Key Timeline: The modern, enhanced program was introduced in 2022, marking a significant upgrade from the previous system.

One of the strange things about the Epstein revelations is how true the reality turns out to be to the imagined conspiracy theory that the world is ruled by a bunch of global elites who are always in charge irrespective of who wins democratic elections. Epstein’s mailing list suggests that America’s true pastime wasn’t baseball, football or even trolling, but hanging out with Jeffrey Epstein . From Donald Trump to Woody Allen, everyone seems to have been close friends with Jeffrey Epstein. Even Noam Chomsky, the world’s most pre-eminent public intellectual, thanked Epstein for explaining the “intricacies of the global financial system” in a way the “business press and professional journals” hadn’t been able to do.It would appear that the man who penned Manufacturing Consent was infatuated with Epstein, who was manufacturing consent in his own way. Speaking of manufacturing consent, recent updates from X suggest that there’s an entire industry which has taken over from mainstream media when it comes to shaping narratives. Much like we saw in James Gunn’s Superman, there is an actual farm of monkeys trolling people online. That’s not a surprise to anyone who is online and opinionated and has faced numerous brickbats from political fans, cricket fans, dog lovers and the occasional Grammar Nazi.That troll farms existed was fairly well-known but even WH Auden would be surprised to learn that many prominent Twitter accounts are run by farms. And we saw that when Elon Musk’s X (the hellhole known firmly as Twitter) rolled out its “About this Account” location panel and suddenly the most ardent patriots found their geotags betraying them. Proud American constitutionalists were from Nigeria or Western Europe, Europeans were proudly flying the MAGA flag, and Gaza fans were pegged in East Asia.The chaos began with a small icon Musk probably assumed would be a cute transparency feature. Instead, it detonated the timeline. For years, people fought with strangers online under the illusion that these strangers lived nearby. That illusion collapsed the moment the map pin dropped. Suddenly, timelines were littered with patriots tweeting from Ankara, Gaza reporters posting from Krakow, and Ivanka Trump megafans tapping away from a quiet suburb in Lagos.The feature exposed not just hypocrisy but the architecture of online politics – the globalised supply chain of outrage that most users never realised they were participating in. Sort of like the dead internet theory but on another whole leve.Thousands of Americans believed they were arguing with fellow citizens; they were, in fact, sparring with accounts run by people who don’t vote in their elections, don’t live in their society, and don’t care about their policies beyond the dopamine of engagement metrics. And because nothing in 2025 happens quietly, the most exposed accounts weren’t marginal. They were celebrities in their ideological microcosms.The patriots posting from everywhere except America The parade of revelations had the comic timing of a farce. The self-declared “ethnically American constitutionalist” account @1776General_ was found tapping away from Turkey. @AmericanVoice__, a 200,000-follower “voice of the people”, appeared to be run from South Asia before vanishing in the world’s fastest guilty deletion. MAGANationX, roughly 400,000 followers, lived comfortably in Eastern Europe.IvankaNews, with nearly a million followers, was unmasked as tweeting from Nigeria — which explains the unlimited energy but not the obsession with Ivanka’s potential political career. Then there were the medium-sized troublemakers: DarkMaga tweeting from Thailand, MAGA Scope broadcasting MAGA love from Nigeria, and MAGA Beacon lighting its patriotic lamp from South Asia.Suddenly, the American culture war looked less like a national debate and more like a global business process outsourcing unit. Patriotism had become a franchise. Even the Founding Fathers would be confused — not at the propaganda, but at the sheer international enthusiasm for it. Gaza influencers and the geography that didn’t add up Gaza-aligned accounts faced their own meltdown. The “Gaza-based journalist” @AbujomaaGaza seemed to be posting from Poland. Quds News Network, via @QudsNen, showed up in Egypt. And the massively influential Times of Gaza was flagged somewhere in the wide, ambiguous region of East Asia.These revelations didn’t discredit the broader cause, but they did highlight how deeply online narratives depend on the illusion of proximity. People wanted to believe they were reading from the frontlines, not from stable WiFi three time zones away. The map pin didn’t reveal deception as much as it revealed desire — the public’s longing for authenticity, even when it is manufactured.Meanwhile, the troll-factory isn’t confined to one border. Multiple investigations and academic studies have shown how Pakistan-based networks routinely impersonate Indian users to manufacture dissent and amplify domestic polarisation. Researchers have traced coordinated behaviour in which clusters of accounts adopt Indian names, stock profile photos, and patriotic bios to blend into Indian conversation spaces — only to switch, en masse, into communal outrage or anti-India propaganda during sensitive moments.During recent flashpoints, these networks circulated recycled riot footage, AI-edited images, and scripted slogans copied across hundreds of handles in seconds. The entire operation works like a psychological supply chain: fake Indian voices generating fake Indian anger to provoke real Indian reactions. The operators remain invisible, the identities disposable, and both dissent and nationalism become export products in a cross-border influence industry.This is where Herman and Chomsky accidentally predicted 2025, though not in the way their disciples imagine. Manufacturing Consent didn’t argue that the media brainwashes people. It argued that media institutions, through structural filters — ownership, advertising, reliance on official sources, ideological framing — quietly set the boundaries of legitimate discourse. Citizens weren’t forced into opinions. They were nudged into predictable lanes.But the internet has mutated that model beyond recognition. In the old world, institutions manufactured consent. In our world, anonymous operators manufacture identities.The propaganda model went from an elite system shaping news coverage to a chaotic free-for-all where anyone with a smartphone and a VPN can manufacture an entire persona: patriot from Ankara or an activist from Krakow or a conflict reported from Manila.The product is illusion, the geography is veneer and truth is obviously optional. The terrifying brilliance of 2025 is that consent is no longer manufactured through editorial agendas but through character creation. These accounts don’t persuade because they are credible. They persuade because they feel authentic — right up until the map pin exposes them.Predictably, the moment the feature launched, VPN usage shot up like a cryptocurrency during a pump-and-dump. Troll farms upgraded from cheap servers to premium residential proxies. IPs rotated. New envelopes of suspicion appeared on profiles. People joked that the VPN detection icon looked like a scarlet letter for the post-truth era. But the truth is simple: there is no technical fix for a philosophical problem. We cannot patch authenticity. We cannot geolocate sincerity. We cannot trace truth to an IP address.The trolls didn’t disappear. They simply changed masks.People reacted with shock, but they shouldn’t have. The internet has always been a masquerade. In 1993, the joke was “On the internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.” In 2025, the joke is “On the internet, your dog might be running a MAGA page from Lagos and a Gaza activism account from Krakow simultaneously.”What the map pin revealed is that people had mistaken masks for faces. They thought avatars were reflections, bios were confessions, and tweets were testimonies. Instead, they were reading carefully engineered performances by people who realised long ago that political identity is just another online aesthetic, like filters or fonts.The location feature will not save X. It will not bring back trust. It will not cleanse the platform’s ideological sewer. But for a brief moment, it acted like a cheap blacklight in a dodgy hotel — illuminating stains people pretended not to see.It reminded the public that the loudest voices online may not live anywhere near the cause they champion, the ideology they promote, or the country they claim to defend.It showed that the global culture wars are not confined to borders. They are products exported like any other commodity.And it left us with a simple lesson: the internet will never tell you who someone is. It will only tell you who they want you to believe they are. The masks are still on. The performances continue. And the trolls, wherever they actually live, are still logging in.For years, establishment media pretended to be the custodian of civilised debate, the velvet-rope bouncer deciding who entered the conversation and who remained outside with the smokers. Social media was supposed to smash that order. Broadband arrived, timelines bloomed, and suddenly everyone — from retired engineers to conspiracy sommeliers — could shout with equal volume. The old guard insisted the “guardrails were gone”, as if democracy had suddenly become too democratic for their liking.But that dismantling was never quite what it looked like. The elites didn’t lose power; they simply lost exclusivity. The gatekeepers vanished, and in their place rose something far more chaotic: algorithmic outrage, Populism-as-a-Service, and armies of personas manufactured from laptops in Lagos, Krakow and Bangkok. The crowd may have taken the stage, but the script was still being written elsewhere.And this is where the twist lands hardest. Chomsky warned that elite institutions shaped our consent. What he didn’t foresee was that, once the old filters collapsed, consent wouldn’t become freer — it would become fragmented, exported, and crowdsourced through troll farms wearing the masks of patriots and activists. The establishment didn’t lose control to the masses. It lost control to the performance of the masses, often staged from thousands of miles away.The guardrails didn’t fall. They were just replaced — and like all great empires, the replacements point back to Rome. A place where spectacle always trumped sincerity, where the crowd’s roar drowned out the truth, and where Maximus was murdered to preserve the illusion of order. In 2025, consent dies the same way — not with censorship, but with performance.","Jeffrey Epstein's mailing list suggests that America’s true pastime wasn’t baseball, football or even trolling, but hanging out with Jeffrey Epstein. From Donald Trump to Woody Allen, everyone seems to have been close friends with Epstein. The parade of revelations had the comic timing of a farce.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125543708,imgsize-71080,width-400,resizemode-4/manufacturing-consent.jpg"

5,200 rescues in 10 months

Israel Or Saudi, Who Has F-35 Edge? Mid-East Air Power Balance Decoded; Game-Changer Or Paper Tiger?

Drones and hyper-efficient operations

Total Calls: The emergency hotline (999) handled over 7.3 million calls last year.

Answering Speed: In the third quarter of this year, 99.3% of all emergency calls were successfully answered within a mere 10 seconds.

Dubai Police Search & Rescue teams carried out 5,200 missions in the first 10 months of 2025 and cut average land-incident response time to 5.8 minutes, beating the strategic target of 6.6 minutes and marking a steady improvement from 6.8 minutes in 2023 and 6.2 minutes in 2024.Dubai Police have achieved unprecedented success in emergency response, setting new benchmarks for global safety forces. Recent figures confirm a dramatic improvement in speed, ensuring patrols and rescue teams reach critical incidents faster than ever before.For critical emergencies, the average response time recorded in the third quarter of this year was an impressive two minutes and seven seconds (2:07). This achievement highlights a continuous improvement compared to the previous year, securing Dubai's reputation for exceptional rapid response.Officials say the gains come from a combination of upgraded readiness, smarter resource allocation and new equipment. During an inspection, Lieutenant General Abdullah Khalifa Al Marri, Commander-in-Chief of Dubai Police, reviewed smart support systems that help dispatch the right units quickly, dedicated vehicle fleets for field and specialised tasks, and closer coordination with the Air Wing.The specialized Search and Rescue teams have also significantly cut their time on the ground. Response times for land-based incidents now average just 5.8 minutes, successfully beating the annual operational target of 6.6 minutes. This represents an improvement of over 14% in readiness across just three years, demonstrating operational excellence is the force's top priority.This remarkable speed is directly powered by smart technology embedded within the General Department of Operations. The Command and Control Centre is the nerve center, demonstrating efficiency even before the teams are dispatched.Key Call Centre Statistics:The use of autonomous technology is also revolutionizing field response. The innovative Drone Box system has become a game-changer, facilitating approximately 3,000 transfers last year. In scenarios classified as ""very urgent,"" the drones achieved an astonishing average response time of just 57 seconds, far surpassing the target of 2 minutes and 45 seconds.This pioneering drone system has garnered international recognition, including the prestigious Edison Award for Autonomous Security Solutions. Dubai Police is currently working toward achieving full drone coverage across the entire emirate by 2028.The speed and technology directly translate into impactful operations protecting lives and property. In the first ten months of this year, the Search and Rescue teams executed more than 5,200 missions.These high-volume rescues cover a wide spectrum of emergencies across all terrains, urban, coastal, and mountainous, and include:This constant high-level performance underscores the department’s role as the ""first line of defense,"" a commitment emphasized by Lieutenant General Abdullah Khalifa Al Marri, Commander-in-Chief of Dubai Police, during recent operational reviews.Dubai’s rescue teams say the numbers reflect people, planning and technology working together, and residents are the clear beneficiaries. As the force rolls out more data-driven systems and greener vehicles, expect response times to stay a top performance measure for Dubai’s emergency services.","Dubai Police Search & Rescue teams carried out 5,200 missions in the first 10 months of 2025. 99.3% of all emergency calls were successfully answered within a mere 10 seconds.

Abu Dhabi truck ban starts Dec 1; key road closures and reroutes explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/abu-dhabi-truck-ban-starts-dec-1-key-road-closures-and-reroutes-explained/articleshow/125500056.cms,"Abu Dhabi enforces new truck rules from December / Image source: File

Abu Dhabi new peak-hour ban

Day Restriction Period 1 (Morning Peak) Restriction Period 2 (Evening Peak/Midday) Monday to Thursday 6:30 AM to 9:00 AM 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM Friday 6:30 AM to 9:00 AM 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM (Midday/Jumaa Prayer)

Abu Dhabi Island



Major city arteries and urban zones



Key entry points like Al Maqta Bridge and Mussafah Bridge



The December 1 rule

Purpose: To accommodate smooth traffic flow and major public events during extended national holidays.



Vehicles Restricted: Typically includes trucks, lorries, and large buses used for transporting workers (50 or more passengers).



Duration Example: A typical holiday ban might run from Friday (mid-day) through Monday (early morning). For instance, restrictions have been implemented from 12:00 PM on Friday, December 1, until 1:00 AM on Monday, December 4.



Locations Affected: Entrances to Abu Dhabi Island, including Sheikh Zayed Bridge, Sheikh Khalifa Bridge, Mussafah Bridge, and Al Maqta Bridge.



Enforcement and compliance

Mandatory Permits: Companies must obtain a freight transport permit from the ITC to operate legally in the Emirate.



Digital Tracking: Vehicles must install electronic tracking devices linked to the ""Asateel"" system. This enables authorities to monitor vehicle location in real-time and ensure compliance with designated routes and restricted hours.



Validity: Operator permits are valid for one year, and driver permits are valid for two years, requiring timely renewal.







The Integrated Transport Centre (ITC) in Abu Dhabi has rolled out essential restrictions on heavy vehicle movement, fundamentally changing logistics planning in the emirate. This move is a strategic step to curb traffic congestion, enhance public safety, and protect vital road infrastructure. These regulations apply across major city roads and entry points, requiring all transport operators to strictly adhere to the revised schedules.To manage the significant volume of daily traffic, the ITC, under Abu Dhabi Mobility, enforces clear ""no-entry"" times for heavy vehicles. The updated rules primarily target freight trucks, large tankers, and construction equipment, aiming to separate slower-moving, heavier traffic from light vehicles during the busiest commuting periods. This separation is crucial, as the interaction between vehicle types often leads to speed variation and accidents.Crucial Locations Affected:This timing is carefully calculated to reduce delays for commuters, allowing emergency and public transport vehicles to move efficiently during rush hours.The original restriction linked to the beginning of December often refers to a temporary, extended ban implemented during national holidays or long weekends, such as the UAE Union Day celebrations.Key Details of Temporary Bans:Exemptions: In both permanent and temporary scenarios, crucial vehicles are usually excluded from the ban, specifically those needed for public sanitation services and vehicles carrying logistical support or essential utilities.Adherence to these rules is mandatory and monitored by the Abu Dhabi Police using advanced systems. Violations are tracked digitally, and non-compliance results in significant penalties, including fines and potential vehicle impoundment for repeat offenders.To streamline and monitor commercial movement, the ITC introduced the ""Asateel"" platform.What Logistics Operators Need to Know:The integration of smart systems ensures that these traffic regulations are not just policies on paper but are actively enforced in the digital and physical traffic landscape of the capital. The ITC and Abu Dhabi traffic authorities will enforce the restrictions; drivers found in breach may face regulatory action under traffic law. The ITC has released maps and alternative-route guidance to help compliance.

Slight temperature drop









Fog thickened over parts of Abu Dhabi and extended into Dubai early on Friday, creating challenging conditions on the roads and slowing visibility to under a kilometre in several spots. Alongside the fog, cooler air, shifting clouds and light dust defined the morning atmosphere, forming a mix of weather elements that led UAE authorities to issue safety alerts and advise motorists to drive with extra care through the first half of the day.Dense fog settled over several parts of Abu Dhabi and extended into areas of Dubai early on November 21, sharply reducing visibility for motorists. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) issued red and yellow alerts to signal varying levels of fog intensity, cautioning that visibility could dip below 1,000 metres in affected coastal and inland zones.Authorities reinforced the warnings with an advisory urging drivers to slow down, maintain safe distances, and remain alert on the roads. The alerts were placed in effect until 10:30am, the window during which fog and mist were expected to persist.Alongside the fog, the NCM noted that the day would bring partly cloudy skies with occasional dust, particularly in open areas. Low clouds were forecast to form westward over the sea and islands, contributing to changing visibility and muted daylight during the early hours.These cloud formations were expected to shift gradually as the day progressed.Friday also marked a modest decline in temperatures, most noticeable along the coastal stretches. The cooler shift accompanied the fog and cloud cover, creating milder conditions compared to previous days. The temperature dip, though slight, aligned with a broader trend of seasonal transition across the region.","Dense winter fog blanketed Abu Dhabi and Dubai, reducing visibility below 1,000 metres.

This pass is an extra benefit that gives you discounts (sometimes up to 15% off) on major city attractions and even includes free access to the Abu Dhabi Tourist Shuttle service.While 10GB for 24 hours is an amazing welcome, there are two crucial details you must keep in mind to ensure a perfect start to your trip: Remember, the 10GB clock starts ticking immediately. If you plan to stay longer than a day (which is likely!), you will need to purchase one of e&’s prepaid Visitor Line packages before the 24-hour free period expires. These plans offer varying amounts of data, call minutes, and longer validity periods.An important rule to remember when using any telecom service in the UAE is that local regulations generally do not permit Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services. This means while you can use apps like WhatsApp, FaceTime, or Viber for chatting and sending media, the voice and video calling functions on these apps may be restricted. You'll need to purchase a paid package that includes local and international minutes for standard calling.","Every international traveler arriving at Zayed International Airport (AUH) will now receive a complimentary visitor SIM card loaded with 10GB of free data. The activation process is completely digital. You simply need to scan a designated QR code and complete a quick, secure connection using facial recognition technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125462989,imgsize-29262,width-400,resizemode-4/esim.jpg"

Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Meet Charlie Javice: Woman who scammed JP Morgan for $175M — but the bank is paying her $142M legal bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meet-charlie-javice-woman-who-scammed-jp-morgan-for-175m-but-the-bank-is-paying-her-142m-legal-bills/articleshow/125369591.cms,"How a startup deal turned into a massive fraud

A conviction that didn’t stop the bills

The controversial expenses

Why JPMorgan cannot simply stop paying

Charlie Javice’s story sounds almost too bizarre to be real: a young fintech founder who tricked JPMorgan into buying her startup for $175 million, ended up convicted of fraud, and is now serving a prison sentence, yet the same company she scammed is still paying more than $142 million for her legal bills, including questionable expenses like luxury hotel upgrades and “cellulite butter. ”Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid. When JPMorgan considered acquiring the startup in 2021, she reportedly presented the bank with millions of supposed student user accounts. Prosecutors later revealed that these numbers had been fabricated, with Javice allegedly hiring a data scientist to generate fake profiles to inflate Frank’s value.JPMorgan completed the acquisition believing Frank had more than four million users, only to discover after the deal that the platform had a tiny fraction of that. The bank alerted authorities, and by 2023 Javice was arrested on federal fraud charges.In March 2025, Javice was convicted of multiple fraud counts and sentenced to more than seven years in prison. But here’s where the story takes an unusual twist: despite defrauding the bank, she is still allowed to bill JPMorgan for her legal defence because of an indemnification clause included in the acquisition agreement.This contractual protection, which is common in startup buyouts, requires JPMorgan to cover certain legal costs for former executives of Frank.As a result, the bank has already paid over $142 million in defence expenses for Javice and her former colleague Olivier Amar.The clause itself is a standard feature in mergers, designed to protect executives from being financially ruined by lawsuits connected to their time at the company. In normal situations, it is meant to ensure fairness and prevent frivolous legal targeting after an acquisition. But in this case, it has trapped JPMorgan in a bizarre obligation: they must keep funding the defence of someone who defrauded them.Had the bank conducted even a simple, early-stage verification of Frank’s user data—such as requesting direct access to the platform’s actual customer records or running a basic audit—this entire dispute could have been avoided. Instead, delayed due diligence and overconfidence in the startup’s claims set the stage for a costly legal mess that continues years after the fraud was uncovered.JPMorgan’s frustration has grown as the legal bills have ballooned. The bank claims the expenses submitted include personal items such as cellulite butter, first-class travel upgrades, and hotel luxuries. Its lawyers argue that the billing records contain “extreme abuses,” including claims for work hours that seem physically impossible.Javice’s spokesperson denies that she personally submitted these questionable charges, stating that her legal team is responsible for all billing decisions.Even though Javice has already been convicted, she is now appealing her case, and the indemnification clause means the bank must continue paying her legal fees unless a court orders otherwise. JPMorgan is currently trying to convince a Delaware judge to halt these payments, arguing that the system is being misused.The saga has become a major lesson in the risks of fast-paced startup acquisitions. JPMorgan’s failure to properly verify Frank’s user base before buying the company has left it entangled in one of the most embarrassing and expensive due diligence failures in recent corporate history.","Charlie Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid.
