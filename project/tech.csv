Antonio Brown ridicules Diddy verdict

Diddy‚Äôs Ex-Chef Expresses 'Grave Concern', Pleads for Safety In Letter To Judge

A recent courtroom sketch representing Sean ""Diddy"" Combs on his knees after his trial verdict has truly lit up social media, stimulating overnight reactions, especially from former NFL star Antonio Brown. Brown, never one to shrink from a hot take, eagerly jumped into the conversation with a cryptic tweet.The music tycoon has been involved in a serious legal battle, facing charges like sex trafficking and racketeering. His trial, which commenced in May 2025, didn't allow cameras, but sketch artists were there to capture every moment.One of these artists, Jane Rosenberg, drew the now-viral image of Combs, which he claimed to look like a ‚ÄòKoala‚Äô. He was acquitted of the major sex trafficking and racketeering charges but was found guilty of two counts of transporting individuals for illegal activities under the Federal Mann Act.This particular sketch resonated deeply with Antonio Brown, prompting him to share his perspective on social media. His tweet, ""Media freak off betrayal..."", hinted ‚Äîa broader sense of exploitation or manipulation, connecting to past discussions surrounding Combs' notorious ""freak offs.‚ÄùThe Diddy trial has beyond doubt been a massive story, even seizing the attention of the sports world. Former Cowboys player Dez Bryant also shared his thoughts. A vital figure in the trial was singer Cassie Ventura, whose powerful evidence charged Combs of severe sexual, emotional, and physical abuse.After the verdict, NFL analyst Ashley Nicole Moss took to X, articulating her empathy: ""My thoughts are with Cassie and her family. as a woman, as a person, her testimony was heartbreaking and I couldn't imagine how she feels this morning. it's the very unfortunate reality of women who experience sexual violence - the story is just never enough.""However, Bryant perceived things differently. He retorted to Moss, saying, ""I respect your opinions heavy but Cassie wasn‚Äôt no victim.. not even close."" Moss quickly pushed back, ""She wasn't a victim? For starters, we saw her beaten on camera."" Bryant then clarified his controversial stance, interpreting, ""I was referring to the freak offs and drugs she chose to participate in‚Ä¶""Also Read: Leanna Lenee accused of controlling Travis Hunter‚Äôs wedding after rejecting his one simple request Concerning Combs himself, his legal journey isn't over. He's been denied bail and will remain in custody until his sentencing on October 3, 2025.

After more than a century, swimmers returned to the River Seine on Saturday, marking the first official reopening of the iconic waterway for public bathing since 1923.Among the first to take a dip was a 95-year-old Parisian, who joined excited locals at the newly launched Bras Marie swim zone in eastern Paris, one of three designated spots now open to the public.""I'm so happy! I've dreamed of swimming in the Seine for years,"" said Ingrid, stepping carefully into the water in her turquoise-blue swimsuit.Chantal Eyboulet, 61, a Paris-based engineer wearing a fluorescent pink swim cap, shared her joy, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been waiting 30 years for this.‚ÄùThe seasonal reopening is a key legacy of the Paris 2024 Olympics, for which the Seine underwent an extensive clean-up to host open-water swimming and triathlon events. Roughly ‚Ç¨1.4 billion was spent to improve water quality and prepare the river for both athletes and the public.Crowds gathered from 8 am as Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo joined the celebrations, watching swimmers of all ages splash into the river under blue skies. ""It‚Äôs a childhood dream to have people swimming in the Seine,"" she said, smiling. ‚ÄúLook at how happy everyone is.‚ÄùEach site is equipped with lifeguards, changing rooms, showers and beach-style seating.Entry is free and available through the end of August, with capacities ranging from 150 to 300 people.Officials say the water quality is now ‚Äúexceptional,‚Äù according to Ile-de-France prefect Marc Guillaume. Still, strong currents and boat traffic remain a concern. Lifeguards will screen swimmers before allowing independent access, and fines will apply for anyone entering the water outside of designated areas.""I feel like a mermaid,"" said 65-year-old Isabel Bertelot, who lives across the river from the Bercy site.

You are not legally considered an employee until a contract is signed and a work permit is issued.





If your offer is revoked unfairly, you may file a civil case for compensation.









If you‚Äôve received a job offer from a UAE-based company, it's natural to feel excited. But before booking your flight and packing your bags, take a moment to confirm whether the offer is legally valid and enforceable. In the UAE, a signed offer letter between an employer and a prospective employee may be considered an, but not necessarily aIn general legal terms, an agreement (like an offer letter) can be informal, while a contract is a formal agreement enforceable by law. In other words, all contracts are agreements, but not all agreements are contracts.When recruiting in the UAE, employers must issue an official offer letter detailing employment terms and conditions. These terms must then appear identically in the employment contract. The employer and employee may also add more favourable terms for the employee if both agree.This is supported by Article 2(1) of Ministerial Decree No. 46 of 2022 regarding work permits, job offers, and employment contract forms, which states:‚ÄúUtilise the approved standard employment contract that conforms with the job offer when requesting the issuance of the work permit.It is permissible to add more benefits to the employee in the contract than those mentioned in the job offer; it is also permissible to add annexure to the contract provided that it does not conflict with the provisions of the decree-law and its executive regulations.""An offer letter must follow the format prescribed by the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MOHRE). As per Article 1 of Administrative Resolution No. 38 of 2022, it is mandatory to use the e-forms available on the MOHRE system:""By the guidelines attached herein, electronic forms (e-forms) provided in Mohre system for work permits, offer letters, and employment contracts shall be adopted and implemented.""When applying for a work permit, employers must submit a signed offer letter and other required documents to MOHRE. After approval and payment of the required fees, an official employment contract is created.Before making any commitments, you should contact MOHRE to verify whether the offer letter you‚Äôve received is legitimate and recorded in their system. If your offer letter is not in MOHRE‚Äôs approved format, you have the right to request one that is.In some cases, you may also approach the UAE Embassy in your country (such as the UK) for assistance in verifying the authenticity of your job offer, if such services are provided.It‚Äôs important to understand that if your prospective employer rescinds the offer letter and you haven‚Äôt signed an employment contract or been issued a work permit, MOHRE may not accept your complaint.This is because an employer and employee are only considered parties to an official employment relationship once a valid contract is signed and registered with MOHRE.If the offer is revoked and you suffer monetary loss or damage as a result, you may consider filing a civil case against the prospective employer in a UAE court that has jurisdiction over such matters.This can be pursued under civil liability claims, particularly if you can prove that the employer‚Äôs actions led to demonstrable harm such as travel arrangements made in anticipation of employment.Staying vigilant during your job search and relocation process can save you significant hardship later.

From trees to table: Why Bahraini almonds are the talk of the season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/from-trees-to-table-why-bahraini-almonds-are-the-talk-of-the-season/articleshow/122289247.cms,"Local vendors showcase vibrant batches of Bahraini almonds as the summer season officially kicks off, with popular varieties like Habban and Jumbo drawing eager buyers/Image: News of Bahrain





With the arrival of summer and rising temperatures, the much-loved Bahraini almonds are once again appearing on fruit stalls and kitchen tables. Known for their high quality and variety, the local almonds especially the popular ""Habban"" and ""Jumbo"" types are now in season, bringing fresh activity to the markets.These almonds began arriving in the markets just a few days ago, with prices ranging between BD2.5 and BD4 per kilogram depending on size and quality. Premium varieties are even fetching prices as high as BD8.In the coming weeks, two more types: Iskandarani and Jumbo are expected to arrive. Both are known for their large size, excellent taste, and firm texture. Shoppers are eagerly awaiting their return to the shelves.To a local news outlet, vendor Ahmed Abu Karim explained that Habban almonds usually kick off the local almond season and are available for about a month. They come in different colours and sizes, such as yellow-within-red and solid red. Prices depend on the size and overall quality, the larger, high-grade almonds can go up to BD7 per kilo, although most are sold between BD2 and BD4.Abu Karim also noted that the quality and quantity of the crop are heavily influenced by humidity.Higher humidity means better ripening, plumper almonds, and a sweeter taste.He added that after the Habban variety, other types begin to appear, especially the Iskandarani almonds which are known for their rich red interior and delicious flavour and the sought-after Jumbo almonds, priced for their size.Another seller, Qassim Abdullah, pointed out that Habban almonds are well-known in Bahrain and are named for their small, rounded shape resembling a ‚Äúlittle seed.‚ÄùHe also mentioned that imported almonds, particularly from Qatif, are becoming more common in local markets and are sold for around BD2 per kilo. However, he believes they can‚Äôt compare to Bahraini almonds in terms of sweetness and taste. Qassim also warned that some sellers are misleading customers by marketing imported almonds as local ones, which he considers dishonest and unfair.As the almond season gains momentum, Bahrainis are once again enjoying one of the country‚Äôs most beloved summer treats: fresh, local, and full of flavour.","Bahraini almonds are once again appearing on fruit stalls and kitchen tables.

In, players enter an empty home haunted by a similar malevolent being. Once inside, they must solve puzzles while evading the creature that lurks in the shadows.Al Hamad says he was intrigued by people‚Äôs obsession with fear.‚ÄúI realised people genuinely enjoy being scared‚Äîit‚Äôs fun for them,‚Äù he told local news outlet‚ÄúI wanted to create something simple but effective. Horror games don‚Äôt require massive development, they require just five or six core mechanics. The rest is all about creativity in the story.‚ÄùLaunched in October 2024,quickly gained traction as regional content creators showcased their playthroughs. It has since reached audiences in East Asia and Turkey, cultures that Al Hamad says share similar folklore roots.Played in first-person, the game immerses players into the shoes of the protagonist exploring what initially seems to be a deserted house. But it becomes clear something sinister is watching. Players must solve puzzles and navigate the space while avoiding the wrath of the ghostly Aunt Fatima.While comparisons have been made toand Hideo Kojima‚Äôs, Al Hamad says those weren‚Äôt direct influences.‚ÄúI scare easily, I don‚Äôt even watch horror films,‚Äù he laughs. ‚ÄúBut somehow, I ended up making a horror game.‚ÄùInstead, his true inspiration came from his own surroundings.He based the haunted house in the game on his grandfather‚Äôs home and also visited abandoned areas in Al Khobar, which locals claim are haunted.‚ÄúFor example, the clock that chimes every quarter hour? That‚Äôs from my grandfather‚Äôs house. The telephone, rugs, bed, and lamps all of them are real details I grew up with,‚Äù he said.That authenticity givesa distinct regional identity. One scene even features a(incense burner) on a table, filling the house with aromatic smoke which is an iconic feature in Gulf households.Despite being a solo project,includes over an hour of gameplay and is powered by Nvidia‚Äôs DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) system. The AI-powered rendering enhances visuals without sacrificing performance, giving the game a polished feel that rivals major studio titles.‚ÄúTo make a horror game work, you need quick reaction time, and DLSS really made that possible,‚Äù Al Hamad said.‚ÄúSeeinglisted on Nvidia‚Äôs site next toandmade me incredibly proud.‚ÄùWith Gulf folklore and nostalgic authenticity woven into every shadowed corner,is setting a new standard for regional horror games and is gaining international recognition while doing it.","Saudi YouTuber and indie developer Abdulla Al Hamad turned to the terrifying end of that spectrum for inspiration for his first-person horror game.

India plans supersonic firepower upgrade: IAF eyes Israeli AIR LORA missile after Rampage success - details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-plans-supersonic-firepower-upgrade-iaf-eyes-israeli-air-lora-missile-after-rampage-success-details/articleshow/122268367.cms,"This is a representational image (Pic credit: Lexica)

High-value targeting with deep strike capability

Fire-and-forget system with mid-flight target update

Navigation, survivability, and all-weather capability

Interoperability and mission flexibility

NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force (IAF) is reportedly considering the acquisition of AIR LORA, an advanced air-launched ballistic missile developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), to significantly bolster its long-range strike capabilities.This potential procurement comes on the heels of the successful deployment of the Rampage missile during Operation Sindoor, where the IAF launched strikes on 11 Pakistani air bases. While Rampage offers a range of 250 kilometres and requires direct aircraft deployment, the AIR LORA missile provides a stand-off range of up to 400 kilometres, enabling precision strikes from a safer distance, beyond the reach of enemy air defence systems.Belonging to IAI's LORA missile family, AIR LORA is described as an extended-range, precise, massive, supersonic weapon. It is specially designed to neutralise high-value, well-defended targets such as airbases, command and control centres, naval vessels, and critical infrastructure.The missile can be launched from IAF platforms such as the Su-30MKI, with a launch weight of 1,600 kilograms. Once fired, AIR LORA travels at supersonic speeds, reaching its target within minutes.Its precision strike ability is marked by a Circular Error Probable (CEP) of less than 10 meters, ensuring minimal collateral damage.AIR LORA features a fire-and-forget design, requiring no further input from the launching aircraft after release. What sets it apart is its ability to update target coordinates mid-flight, allowing it to adapt to evolving battlefield dynamics and shifting targets in real time.According to IAI, ""AIR LORA addresses these operational challenges with unparalleled efficiency and precision.""The missile is equipped with GPS/INS navigation along with anti-jamming technology, ensuring accuracy even in electronic warfare environments where GPS signals may be compromised. It also boasts a seekerless design that employs steep-angle, high-speed attack profiles to increase survivability against air defences. AIR LORA is capable of operating in all-weather conditions.One of AIR LORA's standout features is its broad compatibility with various aircraft types, supporting both standalone and integrated configurations across Western and Eastern platforms. This means the missile can be quickly adopted without the need for extensive retraining or overhaul of existing systems.It also offers multiple warhead configurations, including blast fragmentation, general-purpose, and deep-penetration variants, making it suitable for a wide spectrum of tactical and strategic missions.","The Indian Air Force (IAF) is reportedly considering the acquisition of AIR LORA.

A Fountain Like No Other: The Scale of the Task



The Ongoing Renovation : A Major Overhaul



New Flooring System: The old concrete surface had occasional cracks, disrupting maintenance. Now, a durable waterproofing system is being installed, including a special primer and insulation designed to help with water retention.

Glowing Blue Tiles: These tiles, visible beneath the water from all angles around the lake, are not just visually striking but also functional, adding to the overall aesthetic and longevity of the structure.

Robotic Technology : A Fountain Powered by Machines



Choreography Bots: These robots control the movement of the water jets, ensuring they spray in perfect rhythm with the music.

Lighting Bots: These robots adjust the lighting, ensuring that the visual effects are perfectly in sync with the water's movements.

Fixed Water Jets: These jets spray water in harmony with the beats, adding another layer of coordination to the show.

Keeping Everything Clean: The Underwater Maintenance



A Temporary Pause, but the Show Goes On







The Dubai Fountain is known for its captivating performances, synchronized water jets, dazzling lights, and perfectly timed music. As the world‚Äôs largest choreographed fountain, it draws millions of visitors each year to the heart of Downtown Dubai. But what does it really take to maintain and renovate this iconic spectacle? From intricate underwater technology to the massive team of engineers and robots working tirelessly, the work behind maintaining and renovating the Dubai Fountain never stops. It goes on around the clock, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, ensuring this iconic water show continues to dazzle visitors long into the future. Here‚Äôs a closer look at the monumental effort behind the scenes.The Dubai Fountain isn‚Äôt just big; it‚Äôs enormous. The fountain stretches over an area as large as 18 football fields. Beneath its shimmering surface lies a sophisticated network of water jets, robotic arms, and lighting systems, all working in perfect harmony to create the mesmerizing shows that have made it famous.Given its sheer size, it's no surprise that keeping the fountain in top shape requires a lot of work. In fact, hundreds of engineers and technicians are involved in maintaining the fountain, handling everything from daily upkeep to major renovations.In April 2025, the fountain was temporarily shut down for a five-month renovation to improve its performance, aesthetics, and longevity. The project, confirmed by the fountain‚Äôs developer Emaar, involves an array of upgrades. Though the renovation has taken the fountain offline, the work behind it will ensure that the Dubai Fountain continues to dazzle for years to come.Key improvements include:These changes aren't just about making the fountain look better, they aim to ensure that the fountain runs smoothly and efficiently for years to come.One of the most fascinating aspects of the Dubai Fountain is the extensive use of robotic technology. From choreography bots that control the movement of water to lighting bots that match visual effects with the rhythm of the music, these robots play a crucial role in every performance. In fact, the programming of a single song for the fountain can take several weeks, as multiple robotic systems must be synchronized to create the perfect dance of water and light.The renovation also involves upgrading the technology behind these systems to improve precision and reduce the time it takes to program a new performance. As a result, the fountain will continue to deliver unforgettable shows, with even better choreography and lighting.Beneath the water's surface, maintenance is just as crucial. The fountain's 1.3-meter-deep lake houses the powerful jets and robots, which means it requires constant attention to stay pristine.To keep the fountain looking its best, underwater robots are deployed regularly. These machines clean the lakebed and ensure the water remains at the highest quality. The newly installed soft flooring makes cleaning even quicker and more efficient, allowing for easier maintenance. Water quality checks are conducted regularly, with samples taken from various parts of the lake to ensure the water stays fresh and clear.While the fountain is temporarily out of action, Emaar has ensured that visitors still get a taste of its magic. The construction area has been cleverly integrated with digital display screens that play archival footage of the fountain‚Äôs past performances, in sync with the light shows from the Burj Khalifa. So even though the live fountain shows are paused, the spirit of the Dubai Fountain is still alive, giving visitors a preview of the wonder to come.The renovation is scheduled to wrap up by October 2025, just in time for the cooler months. When the fountain is back in action, it will not only look better but also function more smoothly, thanks to the impressive behind-the-scenes work currently underway.","The Dubai Fountain is known for its captivating performances, synchronized water jets, dazzling lights, and perfectly timed music.

A Troubling Pattern: Tragedies Prompt Renewed Focus on Pool Safety

Dubai Municipality‚Äôs Regulations: What Pool Owners Must Do

1. Defined Roles and Responsibilities:

Pool Owners: Pool owners are required to register their pools with Dubai Municipality before construction or use. They must ensure that the pool meets all design, safety, and hygiene standards set by the authorities. Additionally, owners are responsible for maintaining the pool‚Äôs structural integrity and ensuring it operates safely through regular upkeep.

Contractors and Manufacturers: Contractors and manufacturers have the responsibility to build pools according to established safety codes. They must use non-hazardous materials to guarantee safety and provide proper safety labels to inform users of potential risks. Compliance with these standards is crucial for preventing accidents.

Residents and Pool Users: Residents and users of pools must supervise children at all times to prevent drowning and other accidents. They should follow strict hygiene protocols to maintain water quality and cleanliness. Moreover, securing pools with enclosures, safety covers, or nets when not in use is essential to protect young children and pets from accidental falls.

As more villa communities expand across the UAE and private pools become increasingly popular, a growing public safety concern has emerged especially the rising number of drowning incidents involving children under five. Health authorities and civic officials are now urging residents to take stricter precautions and adhere to comprehensive safety regulations introduced by Dubai Municipality.Recent months have witnessed several tragic drowning cases that have cast a spotlight on the dangers associated with private pools, even when water bodies seem small or harmless.On April 5, six-year-old Ayanvit Chhaparwal, a finalist on UAE‚Äôs Got Talent, died in Abu Dhabi after falling into a swimming pool and suffering a head injury. Two month later, on June 27, a 15-year-old Sudanese boy drowned while swimming with friends at the UAE University Olympic Pool in Al Ain.In Dubai, an Indian family is now facing over Dh100,000 (approximately US $27,230) in medical bills after their son, Ali, nearly drowned in a community pool. The accident happened just days after the family moved to the UAE in search of a better life.Similarly, on April 4, a two-year-old child tragically lost his life after drowning in a bucket of water at his family home in Ras Al Khaimah‚Äôs Sidrouh neighbourhood, a harrowing reminder that even minimal amounts of water can be fatal.Officials from Dubai‚Äôs Health and Safety Department, which investigates such incidents, revealed that most local drowning cases involve unsupervised children, underscoring the critical role of adult supervision.According to the World Health Organisation, drowning remains one of the leading causes of accidental deaths globally, a trend that‚Äôs mirrored across the UAE.To mitigate risk and ensure residential pools are safe for all users, particularly children, Dubai Municipality has issued comprehensive safety regulations that apply to all private pools in residential villas. These rules cover any water feature deeper than 300mm, including hot tubs, inflatable pools, and prefabricated spa pools.Here are the key responsibilities and requirements as laid out by the authorities:All private pools must be registered with Dubai Municipality before construction begins. Any modifications, such as adding slides or diving boards, also require prior municipal approval.Safety around private pools begins with proper fencing and barriers. All fences must be at least 1.2 metres high, designed to be child-resistant, climb-proof, and free of gaps that children could squeeze through. Additionally, pool covers and safety nets are strongly recommended, especially in homes with young children. These covers must meet the ASTM F1346-91 international safety standards and be sturdy enough to support the weight of two adults and one child in case of emergency. It is also important to keep rescue tools like pool brushes or leaf scoops nearby, ensuring quick access if needed.Access to the pool must be carefully controlled to prevent accidental entry by children. Gates and entrances should open outward, be self-closing and self-latching, with locks installed at least 1.5 metres above ground to keep them out of children‚Äôs reach. The use of garage doors or automated perimeter gates for pool access is strictly prohibited to avoid unsupervised entry. Windows overlooking pools require fixed security screens or limiters that prevent openings wider than 100mm. Balconies close to pool areas must also have child-proof barriers installed for added safety.Maintaining clean, healthy pool water is essential. Owners must conduct daily testing of water for pH levels, chlorine, and temperature, with more thorough bi-weekly checks for additional parameters. Furthermore, microbiological testing is mandatory every two months to ensure compliance with health standards. For emergencies, CPR instructions must be clearly displayed near the pool, alongside important contact numbers for ambulance, police, and civil defence services. A well-stocked first aid kit and rescue equipment, such as poles or hooks, should always be within easy reach to respond promptly in case of an accident.While Dubai Municipality‚Äôs regulations set a robust safety framework, the most critical element remains active adult supervision, officials say.‚ÄúSafety begins at home,‚Äù the municipality stresses. Teaching children how to swim and staying vigilant whenever they are near water are the most effective ways to prevent tragedy.For further details on compliance or to register a pool, residents are encouraged to contact the Health and Safety Department of Dubai Municipality via:","Dubai Municipality has issued comprehensive safety regulations that apply to all private pools in residential villas.

Tyres: The Critical Contact Point With the Road

The Five-Year Tyre Rule

The Deadly Danger of Leaving Children in Cars

RTA‚Äôs Essential Tips for Safe Summer Driving

Ensure your vehicle‚Äôs air conditioning is functioning properly and effectively cooling the interior during hot days.

Check engine oil and radiator coolant levels regularly, especially in summer when engine temperatures can spike.

Maintain correct tyre pressure and inspect tyre condition carefully to avoid blowouts caused by high temperatures.

Keep your brake system clean and well-maintained; replace worn brake components to ensure optimal braking performance.

Keep the vehicle tidy and clean, this helps with early fault detection and prolongs the vehicle‚Äôs lifespan. Always ensure windscreens, windows, and headlights are clean for clear visibility.

Avoid parking under direct sunligt for extended periods. Whenever possible, park in shaded areas to protect the vehicle from extreme heat damage.

With summer temperatures reaching dangerous highs, the RTA‚Äôs campaign serves as a crucial reminder that simple preventive measures can save lives on the roads.





As the UAE enters the peak of summer with temperatures soaring up to 50¬∞C, Dubai‚Äôs Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has issued an urgent reminder for motorists to conduct routine vehicle checks and servicing. The goal is to prevent accidents and ensure the safety of all road users during the harshest months of the year.In coordination with the Ministry of Interior and Dubai Police, the RTA has launched its annual campaign titled ‚ÄòSummer Without Accidents‚Äô, emphasizing precautionary measures to avoid traffic incidents caused by the extreme weather.Ahmed Al Khzaimy, director of traffic at RTA‚Äôs Traffic and Roads Agency, emphasized the importance of simple yet effective maintenance:‚Äú(We) urge all motorists to conduct regular and routine maintenance checks, including a quick inspection before setting off. This should involve a visual check of tyre pressure, engine oil and coolant levels, and ensuring there are no oil or water leaks beneath the vehicle.‚ÄùHe explained that such quick inspections could help prevent unexpected breakdowns, which tend to increase the risk of traffic accidents and negatively affect road safety across the Emirate.Authorities have particularly stressed the need for motorists to check their tyres carefully.Tyres are the only part of a vehicle that comes in direct contact with the road, and under the intense summer heat, worn-out or old tyres are at risk of bursting. Such incidents can lead to severe road accidents with disastrous consequences.Highlighting the dangers, Abu Dhabi authorities shared a video showing multiple vehicles, including a truck and several cars, losing control due to damaged tyres. The vehicles skidded across the roads, crashed into barriers, overturned, or sustained significant damage, all posing additional hazards to other road users.RTA regulations strictly prohibit tyres that are older than five years from being used on UAE roads. This rule aims to reduce tyre-related accidents, which spike during the summer months.Speaking to local news media outlet Khaleej Time, Thomas Edelmann, founder and managing director of RoadSafetyUAE, said:‚ÄúThe number of vehicles parked on the hard shoulder with tyre defects increases in summer. Tyre debris, mainly from decomposing commercial vehicle tyres, can be seen more during the hot summer months.‚ÄùEdelmann added:‚ÄúThe solution is to continuously educate motorists about the importance of tyre safety and maintenance. Tyres must be procured, fitted and maintained properly, especially during summer.‚ÄùOne of the most alarming risks highlighted in the ‚ÄòSummer Without Accidents‚Äô campaign is the danger of leaving children unattended inside vehicles. The RTA warned that children left in cars can suffer from suffocation and death within minutes, even if the air conditioning is on.Ahmed Al Khzaimy strongly urged parents:‚ÄúNot to leave their children in the car, not even for a short period.‚ÄùHe stressed that the air conditioning does not provide sufficient protection in a sealed environment where temperatures can rise rapidly and dangerously.To help motorists stay safe during the hot summer months, the RTA shared the following practical tips:",Dubai‚Äôs Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has issued an urgent reminder for motorists to conduct routine vehicle checks and servicing.

In contrast, buildings in the city obstruct natural air currents, making the urban environment feel stagnant and warmer.

The Science Behind the Desert‚Äôs Cooling Effect

Desert Temperature Drop : After a blazing day with temperatures soaring past 40¬∞C, the desert can cool down by as much as 10 to 15¬∞C at night. This makes for a surprisingly pleasant evening environment.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here‚Äôs a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.
