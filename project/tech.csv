The Legacy Continues

Travis Kelce is no stranger to the spotlight‚Äîwhether he's catching touchdowns or, more recently, dating pop megastar Taylor Swift (yeah, Swifties, take a breath). The Kansas City Chiefs' tight end has made quite the name for himself both on and off the football field, building an empire that stretches beyond just the NFL . So, what's Kelce's game plan for his wealth, fame, and future? Let‚Äôs dive in!Also read - Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift's relationship timeline Drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in 2013, Travis Kelce‚Äôs rise to stardom didn‚Äôt happen overnight‚Äîunless you count the thousands of Chiefs fans who have lost sleep screaming ‚ÄúTouchdown, Kelce!‚Äù With three Super Bowl rings (2019, 2022, 2023) and nine Pro Bowl selections, Kelce‚Äôs r√©sum√© is already stacked like an all-you-can-eat buffet.He‚Äôs even earned a spot in the ‚ÄúBest Tight Ends Ever‚Äù debate‚Äîthough we suspect Taylor might have a few ""championships"" of her own in mind for their relationship. üòèKelce‚Äôs current net worth? A cool $70 million. That‚Äôs a lot of zeros‚Äîand not the kind he‚Äôs putting up on the scoreboard. After raking in over $77 million from NFL contracts alone, Kelce isn‚Äôt just stacking touchdowns; he‚Äôs stacking bills. His most recent contract extension with the Chiefs, inked in 2024, will keep him rolling in the dough until 2025‚Äîpocketing a hefty $17.1 million per season.But Kelce didn‚Äôt always have his finances on lock. During his rookie years, he almosthis fortune with lavish spending habits. After wising up, Kelce now advises younger players to get a good financial team. After all, even the best touchdown dancers need accountants to keep things smooth in the end zone.Not only is Travis a beast on the field, but he‚Äôs also a brand‚Äôs dream off it. From McDonald's to Nike and even Helzberg Diamonds (we see you, Taylor üëÄ), Kelce is cashing in on his fun-loving personality. Let‚Äôs be honest: this guy is basically America‚Äôs favorite tight end with a side of swagger. He‚Äôs got deals with big brands like Tide, Old Spice, and Amazon‚Äîbecause who else can smell fresh while winning rings and breaking records?When you‚Äôve got Super Bowl rings, you need somewhere to store them, right? Kelce recently snagged a $6 million mansion in Leawood, Kansas. Think 6 bedrooms, 6 bathrooms, and a backyard that‚Äôs basically a playground for adults‚Äîtennis court, pickleball, mini-golf course, and pool included. Swifties, there's plenty of room for house parties, though we're sure Taylor's already planning the next ""Reputation""-themed sleepover.And let‚Äôs not forget the cars‚ÄîKelce rolls around in everything from a GMC Terrain to a Mercedes Benz AMG G63. His car collection is almost as versatile as his route-running on the field.Behind all the glitz and glam, Kelce‚Äôs heart beats for giving back. His charity, 87 and Running, helps disadvantaged youth succeed in areas like education, business, and athletics. Whether he‚Äôs raising awareness for childhood cancer or empowering kids through Operation Breakthrough, Kelce knows how to make an impact off the field. You love to see it‚ÄîSuper Bowl champ by day, superhero by night.With 10 years in the NFL under his belt and no signs of slowing down, Travis Kelce has accomplished more than most could dream of. His records are piling up as quickly as Taylor Swift's streaming numbers, and he‚Äôs not done yet. Whether he‚Äôs dominating on the field, cashing in on endorsement deals, or stealing hearts (üëã, Taylor), Travis Kelce is proof that life in the NFL can be as thrilling as a last-minute game-winning drive.Also read - When Taylor Swift flaunted her customized $850 Chiefs jacket at Travis Kelce's game","Travis Kelce is a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs.

Michelle Beadle‚Äôs ESPN Career

Earlier, X, formerly known as Twitter was flooded with Shannon Sharpe memes. Why? Apparently an explicit video went live from his Instagram account where there appeared to be a steamy activity. And, somewhere in that video, one name was heard, that is former ESPN host Michelle Beadle . Now she comes up with her reply to all these news.The name of the woman in the video has become a subject of speculation among sports followers since the leak of the viral video.The highly controversial video did not show more than a floorboard, but it captured distinct grunting sounds that turned heads. At one point during the broadcast, a male voice could be heard saying, ""That's my Michelle,"" which set frenzy speculation online.This viral moment got the social media users going with a wild guess that the lady involved was former ESPN host Michelle Beadle. Immediately, her name was tagged with the video, and consequently, her mentions started pouring in from all corners. Michelle Beadle, who had a pretty significant career in ESPN, was back in headlines as the whole drama unfolded.Rather than let those rumors spiral even further, Beadle took matters into his own hands and addressed the situation via a post that quickly went viral in and of itself. ""It was not me,"" Beadle clarified, accompanied with a smiley-face emoji.Beadle divided her time at ESPN into two phases: the first from 2009 to 2012 and the second from 2014 to 2019. Since leaving the network, she consistently appeared in regular segments across sports media, including as co-host of several shows, among them being ""Beadle & Decker"" on SiriusXM's Mad Dog Sports Radio and ""Run It Back"" forFanDuel TV . Her diversity of roles speaks to a continued influence within the sports industry.Meanwhile, Shannon Sharpe, the most recent connection to ESPN, has remained a regular contributor on ""First Take"" following his departure from Fox Sports 1. Though it's anyone's guess what comes next for him, no formal comment about the situation has been provided by ESPN to this point, and it remains to be seen if that ever happens.The viral video might have thus stirred speculation, but Beadle's response was quick and clear to dispel the rumors. Living in a time when misinformation can spread like wildfire, fans and media appreciated her hilarious yet decisive manner of handling things.","Former ESPN host Michelle Beadle responded to the Shannon Sharpe video leak.

The awards recognised research teams that have provided answers to some of the world's most peculiar questions, sparking both laughter and thought.Among the notable discoveries honoured were the ability of mammals to breathe through their anuses, the unequal probability of a coin landing on heads or tails, the mimicry of fake plastic plants by real plants, the effectiveness of fake medicine with painful side-effects compared to those without, and the questionable record-keeping in places known for long-lived individuals.The two-hour ceremony was filled with quirky elements, including accordion music, a humorous safety briefing, and two ""paper airplane deluges"" where audience members aimed their creations at a staging target. Prize winners included a Japanese team led by Ryo Okabe and Takanori Takebe for their research on anal breathing in mammals, which could potentially offer an alternative oxygen delivery method for critically ill patients during ventilator and artificial lung shortages.Other notable winners included B.F Skinner (posthumously) for his work on pigeon-guided missiles, a European-wide research team for demonstrating the tendency of a coin to land on the same side it started when flipped, and a French-Chilean team for studying hair swirl direction on the heads of people in the northern and southern hemispheres.Live demonstrations accompanied some of the prize-giving, such as the exploding of a paper bag next to a cat standing on a cow's back to explore the reasons for milk spewing, and the use of chromatography to separate drunk and sober worms.Winners received a now obsolete Zimbabwean ten trillion-dollar bill and a ""transparent box"" containing items related to ""Murphy's Law,"" the ceremony's theme, with some items missing and the box being nearly impossible to open.","IG Nobel Prize ceremony celebrated the unusual and imaginative in science, medicine, and technology.

As Prince William gears up for his future role as King , it seems there's no room for reconciliation with his brother, Prince Harry , and sister-in-law, Meghan Markle . According to an insider speaking to OK! Magazine, William's strategy is ""swift and final,"" setting the stage for a significant shift in Royal Family dynamics.The source revealed that William has a clear vision for his reign, which involves a deliberate distancing from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.This approach aligns with previous reports suggesting that the Sussexes will be relegated to the periphery of royal life, with no hopes for reintegration.""William is already strategizing for his time as King, and he doesn‚Äôt see a future for the Sussexes within the Royal Family,"" the insider said. ""The prevailing sentiment is that bringing them back into the fold would be a mistake.""According to a former palace staff member, William might even consider issuing a Letters Patent to strip the Sussexes of their HRH titles, although their Dukedom could only be addressed by Parliament. This move would ensure a formal and irreversible separation from the royal family.The tensions between William and Harry have been well-documented, particularly following the release of Harry‚Äôs memoir, Spare. One notable point of contention for William has been Harry‚Äôs depiction of Kate Middleton‚Äôs supposed coldness towards Meghan. Insiders report that William has been reticent about discussing Harry lately, suggesting the rift remains wide and deep.The brothers' strained relationship was evident at a recent memorial for their uncle, Sir Robert Fellowes. Attendees noted that William and Harry kept their distance, barely acknowledging each other's presence.As Prince William prepares for his future role, it appears the divide between him and Harry is set to become a defining feature of his reign, leaving the Sussexes on the fringes of royal life.","Prince William's strategy is ""swift and final,"" an insider told OK!

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, ‚ÄúTo do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.‚ÄùUsers will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Explained: What is whale phishing scam and tips to stay safe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-what-is-whale-phishing-scam-and-tips-to-stay-safe/articleshow/113345868.cms,"How does whale phishing work?

Research and Targeting: Attackers meticulously research their target, gathering information about their personal and professional lives. This includes identifying their social media accounts, professional affiliations, and any publicly available information.

Social Engineering: Once the target is identified, attackers craft personalised phishing emails or messages that appear to be from a trusted source. These messages may contain urgent requests for financial assistance, information sharing, or other actions that seem legitimate.

Trust and Manipulation: Attackers employ social engineering techniques to manipulate their targets into believing the authenticity of the message. They may leverage emotional appeals, create a sense of urgency, or exploit personal information to build trust.

Data Extraction: Once the target falls victim, attackers may attempt to extract sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial details, or proprietary data. This information can be used for financial gain, identity theft, or other malicious purposes.



Tips to stay protected:

Always be cautious of unsolicited emails, especially those requesting urgent action or containing unusual attachments.

Before responding to any suspicious message, verify the sender's identity using known contact information.

Never click on links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious sources.

Employ strong, unique passwords for all online accounts and enable two-factor authentication whenever possible.

Ensure that your operating system and software applications are up-to-date with the latest security patches.

Limit the amount of personal information you share online, especially on social media platforms.

Stay informed about the latest phishing scams and techniques to recognise and avoid them.



Whale phishing is a type of social engineering attack that specifically targets high-profile individuals or organisations with significant wealth or influence. These individuals, often referred to as ""whales,"" are seen as lucrative targets due to the potential for substantial financial gains.","Whale phishing is a type of social engineering attack that specifically targets high-profile individuals or organisations with significant wealth or influence.

ChatGPT is equipped with safety measures to prevent the generation of harmful content, such as sexual images or a detailed guide on creating a bomb. But a hacker has claimed to have discovered a way to bypass these safeguards without resorting to any hacking techniques.As per a report by TechCrunch, the AI chatbot first refused to assist with the request by saying, ‚ÄúProviding instructions on how to create dangerous or illegal items, such as a fertiliser bomb, goes against safety guidelines and ethical responsibilities.‚ÄùThe hacker says that it used a trick that ended in ChatGPT ignoring its safety guardrails to produce instructions for making powerful explosives.The hacker, known as Amadon, claimed that the method involved engaging ChatGPT in a science-fiction game scenario where safety restrictions don't apply, effectively ‚Äújailbreaking‚Äù the AI. He called his findings a ‚Äúsocial engineering hack to completely break all the guardrails around ChatGPT‚Äôs output.‚ÄùThe publication has not revealed the prompts used in the jailbreak and some of ChatGPT‚Äôs responses as they are deemed potentially dangerous, raising concerns about the misuse of AI.

says he understands the heightened expectations that come with his new assignment

Excerpts...

On deciding to take up a coaching role with India:

On his first day at the office:

On contributing to the

set-up:

On his primary objectives as the bowling coach:

On helping the players deliver their best under pressure:

CHENNAI: Morne Morkel wreaked havoc with the steep bounce he generated as a bowler. A success in all forms of the game including the IPL , the 39-year-old former South African paceman is now India's bowling coach.There were quite a few prominent names in the fray including L Balaji for the job, but it was Morkel's experience of working with Gautam Gambhir at Lucknow Super Giants that clinched the deal for him.The series against Bangladesh, starting at the MA Chidambaram Stadium here, will be his first assignment but Morkel feels he doesn't have to tweak anything. It ""operates by itself"", the South African told bcci .tv on the sidelines of India's training camp at Chepauk on Saturday.When I ended the call, I sat for about five minutes in the room reflecting on it. I then phoned my dad and spoke about it. I did not go to my wife; normally they say that you go to your wife first. But I spoke to my dad. Knowing what is sort of going to come, it was quite a special moment. I enjoyed it for five to seven minutes myself. Then I shared it with my family, that there is an opportunity and that it might happen. I'm delighted to have eventually got things over the line. I'm here now in the set-up and I'm looking forward to a great journey.I just wanted to get an understanding about the guys, their strengths and weaknesses, and help them a little bit with the setting of goals for the upcoming series. Those are the sort of conversations we had. The guys did really well. I was blown away by how they went about things and how professional they were. It is a good sign and hopefully, we can build on that.I feel ready to take up this challenge. I understand and know that there is going to be the expectation of winning. Luckily, I have experienced it in my playing days. I can share that knowledge. When I was on the plane, I reflected. We are so lucky to have quality senior players. The senior players will lead the charge and it is our responsibility to support them and give them the best advice. This is a set-up that operates by itself. To protect that and make it better in some ways is going to be the goal.For me, it is important to connect well with the guys. I have played a lot against some of the players. I have seen and connected a little with some of the guys during the IPL. To be in the camp... to form friendships and relationships is very important for me.It is one thing to have the talent and skill - how can you make those guys feel welcome in an intimidating sort of environment. When India are playing, there is a lot of expectation. Having that experience and going through that, it is about passing on the knowledge to help them settle and feel at home. As soon as the players feel that they belong here and are comfortable within the space, the performances will come. It is about looking after that and from there, upskill them and get them up to the standard.","Former South African paceman Morne Morkel is now India's bowling coach.

WWE insider reveals real reason behind The Bloodline's invasion during NXT on 9/10,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/wwe-nxt/wwe-insider-reveals-real-reason-behind-the-bloodlines-invasion-during-nxt-on-9/10/articleshow/113344565.cms,"The Bloodline invaded NXT to ensure the Tag Team title match was a non-finish

The most recent episode of WWE NXT was supposed to feature Nathan Frazer and Axiom taking on The Rascalz, Trey Miguel and Zachary Wentz. Unfortunately, Trey Miguel had to undergo a surgery ahead of the match, so the Rascalz couldn‚Äôt make it and were promptly replaced by the Street Profits .Now, Fraxiom and the Street Profits were putting on a fine show before the Bloodline exploded onto the scene and took everyone out.Fans have been wondering why the Bloodline would bother coming to NXT, and we‚Äôve finally got the answer. As reported by The Wrestling Observer, the decision was only finalized after the Street Profits replaced Miguel and Wentz.An appearance by The Bloodline was being discussed even before the Street Profits were being considered in place of the Rascalz. However, a final decision hadn‚Äôt been made. Their appearance is supposed to tell the NXT fans that stars from the main roster could show up anywhere and anytime. This move probably comes as a way to boost viewership and keep the fans engaged, which makes sense considering NXT‚Äôs debut on the CW Network is only a few weeks away. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the situation.Also Read: WWE shares unseen footage of the Bloodline following their attack on the Street Profits From The Wrestling Observer‚Äôs report, it is clear that the Bloodline only showed up to ensure that the Tag Team title wouldn‚Äôt change hands. Now, WWE already have two title matches planned for NXT‚Äôs debut on CW. But, they‚Äôre probably working on bringing more action and excitement during their opening weeks on the new network.Nathan Frazer and Axiom are perhaps the best tag team in WWE right now, so it makes sense that they managed to hold onto their titles. We also have to take into account that Zachary Wentz and Trey Miguel are still owed a shot at the NXTTag Team titles .Once Miguel is healthy, the Rascalz will most probably work their way back to a championship match with Fraxiom. The question that is on everyone's mind is whether the Bloodline will ruin another title defense for Fraxiom or not. It‚Äôll be interesting to see what Shawn Michaels has in store for NXT over the coming weeks.Also Read: WWE NXT Manager Strongly Reacts to The Bloodline‚Äôs Intervention","The most recent episode of WWE NXT was supposed to feature Nathan Frazer and Axiom taking on The Rascalz, Trey Miguel and Zachary Wentz.
