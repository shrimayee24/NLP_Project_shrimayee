The long-awaited winter update for GTA Online, titled “A Safehouse in the Hills” DLC, is almost here. It arrives on December 10, 2025, and delivers one of the most significant character returns in the game’s history.This update is set to be much more than just a content pack, and it is a nostalgic trip that will bring back the iconic Michael De Santa into GTA Online. Besides the character’s return, the update also enables you to buy luxury mansions in the game.Here are all the details that you need to know about GTA Online’s A Safehouse in the Hills DLC.Michael's return is monumental for longtime fans of the franchise, given his absence was noticeable after GTA 5 concluded. The natural assumption for everyone was that Michael had achieved the retired Hollywood life he always desired. Nevertheless, the latest reveal trailer for A Safehouse in the Hills confirms that this theory is out the window.The trailer showcases an older Michael with white hair, suggesting that time has passed. However, he still possesses the volatile personality that defines him. This shows that he has aged, but has certainly not mellowed from his previous lifestyle.Michael's wife, Amanda De Santa, is also confirmed to appear, tying the protagonist's return to his infamously chaotic family life.While Rockstar has not given a full explanation of his role, Michael will likely be assisting players with new content centered on the mansions. There will possibly be a series of connected missions, or he will be simply providing advice.A Safehouse in the Hills DLC is launching on December 10, 2025, and it marks the first time you can purchase full-scale luxury mansions in GTA Online. These high-end properties are available for purchase in the coveted areas of Los Santos:These mansions are designed to make a full-power statement, featuring an array of luxury amenities: pools, helipads, hot tubs, garages, and expansive driveways. Inside them, you will also gain access to functional rooms like arcades, armories, vehicle workshops, and display podiums for their prized vehicles.Michael De Santa's involvement points towards the update being more focused on detailed storytelling and experience than what Rockstar typically releases. This would make A Safehouse in the Hills DLC among the best releases in GTA Online’s history.","The long-awaited winter update for GTA Online, titled “A Safehouse in the Hills” DLC, is almost here.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg welcome note

I'm excited to welcome Alan and Billy to Meta to work with me, Boz, and our team to drive this important work forward.

We're entering a new era where AI glasses and other devices will change how we connect with technology and each other. The potential is enormous, but what matters most is making these experiences feel natural and truly centered around people. With this new studio, we're focused on making every interaction thoughtful, intuitive, and built to serve people.

Alan will be joined by Billy Sorrentino, another acclaimed design lead from Apple; Joshua To, who has led our interface design across Reality Labs; our industrial design team led by Pete Bristol; and our metaverse design and art teams led by Jason Rubin.

The new studio will bring together design, fashion, and technology to define the next generation of our products and experiences. Our idea is to treat intelligence as a new design material and imagine what becomes possible when it is abundant, capable, and human-centered. We plan to elevate design within Meta, and pull together a talented group with a combination of craft, creative vision, systems thinking, and deep experience building iconic products that bridge hardware and software,” wrote Zuckerberg.

A new jaguar spotted in Arizona points to progress in the endangered species' recovery,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-new-jaguar-spotted-in-arizona-points-to-progress-in-the-endangered-species-recovery/articleshow/125793811.cms,"Photo credit- AP





The spots gave it away. Just like a human fingerprint, the rosette pattern on each jaguar is unique so researchers knew they had a new animal on their hands after reviewing images captured by a remote camera in southern Arizona.The University of Arizona Wild Cat Research and Conservation Center says it's the fifth big cat over the last 15 years to be spotted in the area after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. The animal was captured by the camera as it visited a watering hole in November, its distinctive spots setting it apart from previous sightings.""We're very excited. It signifies this edge population of jaguars continues to come here because they're finding what they need,"" Susan Malusa, director of the center's jaguar and ocelot project, said during an interview Thursday.The team is now working to collect scat samples to conduct genetic analysis and determine the sex and other details about the new jaguar, including what it likes to eat. The menu can include everything from skunks and javelina to small deer.As an indicator species, Malusa said the continued presence of big cats in the region suggests a healthy landscape but that climate change and border barriers can threaten migratory corridors.She explained that warming temperatures and significant drought increase the urgency to ensure connectivity for jaguars with their historic range in Arizona.More than 99% of the jaguar's range is found in Central and South America, and the few male jaguars that have been spotted in the U.S. are believed to have dispersed from core populations in Mexico, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Officials have said that jaguar breeding in the U.S. has not been documented in more than 100 years.Federal biologists have listed primary threats to the endangered species as habitat loss and fragmentation along with the animals being targeted for trophies and illegal trade.The Fish and Wildlife Service issued a final rule in 2024, revising the habitat set aside for jaguars in response to a legal challenge. The area was reduced to about 1,000 square miles (2,590 square kilometers) in Arizona's Pima, Santa Cruz and Cochise counties.Recent detection data supports findings that a jaguar appears every few years, Malusa said, with movement often tied to the availability of water. When food and water are plentiful, there's less movement.In the case of Jaguar #5, she said it was remarkable that the cat kept returning to the area over a 10-day period. Otherwise, she described the animals as quite elusive.""That's the message - that this species is recovering,"" Malusa said. ""We want people to know that and that we still do have a chance to get it right and keep these corridors open.""",The University of Arizona Wild Cat Research and Conservation Center says it's the fifth big cat over the last 15 years to be spotted in the area after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

Meet Dubai's Ferrari Purosangue Mansory

Strategic supercar policing

Beyond speed





Dubai Police has once again elevated its globally recognized luxury patrol fleet, unveiling an ultra-rare, customized Ferrari Purosangue Mansory, a 755-horsepower powerhouse that is one of only seven units modified worldwide. Marking 12 years of their strategic use of supercars, the Ministry of Interior confirmed the addition will be deployed in major tourist attractions like the Burj Khalifa to boost visibility, assist visitors, and underscore Dubai's commitment to security, innovation, and high-end excellence.Dubai Police has redefined luxury law enforcement once again by adding a highly customized Ferrari Purosangue Mansory to its world-famous fleet. This new patrol car is not just a high-performance vehicle; it is a global rarity, being one of only seven customized units of its kind in the entire world.The vehicle was specially modified by the German tuning house Mansory, giving it an aggressive yet sophisticated look perfectly suited for the streets of Dubai. The custom upgrades include a full carbon-fibre exterior kit, a sporty front bumper, a prominent rear wing, and custom forged FC.5 wheels.Inside, the cabin features a bespoke interior with premium leather and carbon-fibre trims, reflecting the city’s commitment to high-end excellence.The car’s performance is as impressive as its looks. This machine is powered by a massive 6.5-litre V12 engine, which produces an incredible 755 horsepower and 730Nm of torque. This power allows the patrol car to rocket from 0 to 100km/h in a mere 3.1 seconds and reach a top speed of 320km/h.The unveiling of the customized Ferrari took place at an anniversary event held in front of the iconic Emirates Towers. This celebration marked a significant milestone: 12 years of the Dubai Police’s luxury patrol fleet.The concept of using supercars for police patrols began in 2013 with the introduction of a Lamborghini, quickly turning the fleet into an international symbol of Dubai's innovative approach to security. Today, the luxury fleet has grown to an impressive 56 high-performance vehicles.The strategic purpose of these vehicles, including the new Ferrari, is not chase or speed, but enhanced visibility and global branding.Brigadier Saeed Al Hajri, Director of the General Department of Criminal Investigation, confirmed that the fleet reflects Dubai Police's commitment to innovation and service excellence. He stated that the new patrol will operate across major tourist hubs to assist visitors and strengthen community engagement.The luxury patrols are mobile service units, ensuring a highly visible and approachable presence where the police force can interact directly with residents and millions of visitors.The new Ferrari Purosangue Mansory will be immediately deployed in key tourist zones, including the Burj Khalifa, Mohammed bin Rashid Boulevard, and Jumeirah Beach Residence (JBR). By positioning these eye-catching cars in high-traffic areas, the police aim to bolster the sense of safety and showcase Dubai’s modern image.The fleet’s community role extends far beyond patrolling. Lieutenant Colonel Muhammad Abdulrahman noted that the patrol cars have participated in 1,184 events over the last three years. Crucially, they are also used to engage with the public on a personal level, having helped fulfil 49 wishes for children between 2023 and 2025, reinforcing the police’s focus on community happiness and positive interaction.","Dubai Police has redefined luxury law enforcement once again by adding a highly customized Ferrari Purosangue Mansory to its world-famous fleet.

"‘Behavioural cocaine’: Australia defends social media ban for kids; no TikTok, Instagram for under-16s",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/behavioural-cocaine-australia-defends-social-media-ban-for-kids-no-tiktok-instagram-for-under-16s/articleshow/125732662.cms,"AP file photo





Australia’s government on Wednesday justified its social media ban for under-16s, arguing it will protect young people from being pulled into an online “purgatory.”“With one law, we can protect Generation Alpha from being sucked into purgatory by the predatory algorithms described by the man who created the feature as behavioural cocaine,” communications minister Anika Wells said, as cited by AFP.Australia is set to impose a ban from December 10, preventing users under 16 from accessing a range of major social media platforms and websites, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube.The eSafety Commissioner must be satisfied that social media platforms have taken “reasonable steps” to prevent users under 16 from holding accounts, or they could face fines of up to $49.5 million. The government has said the list of affected platforms is dynamic, meaning other services could be added later if young users shift to them and similar risks arise.The commissioner has indicated that platforms like Lemon8 could be added to the list and would be required to remove accounts for under-16 users.Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese has described social media as “a platform for peer pressure, a driver of anxiety, a vehicle for scammers and, worst of all, a tool for online predators.”Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined to disclose how it plans to identify users it “understands” to be under 16, saying doing so could potentially alert teens on how to bypass the ban.Snapchat said it will use account behavioural signals along with the birth dates provided on user accounts to identify those believed to be under 16.TikTok stated it will adopt a “multi-layered approach to age assurance” using “various technologies and signals” to verify users’ ages, adding that it will share further details ahead of December 10, as cited by the Guardian.YouTube on Wednesday criticised the ban and described the world-first legislation as “rushed” and unrealistic.""Most importantly, this law will not fulfil its promise to make kids safer online, and will, in fact, make Australian kids less safe on YouTube,"" YouTube public policy manager Rachel Lord stated, as cited by AFP.YouTube, one of the world’s most-visited websites, had initially been exempted from the ban so children could continue accessing educational content.However, in July, the Australian government reversed course, citing the need to protect young users from “predatory algorithms.”","Australia is set to impose a ban from December 10, preventing users under 16 from accessing a range of major social media platforms and websites.

Singapore will require all secondary school students to keep their smartphones and smartwatches locked away for the entire duration of the school day from January 2026, extending an existing restriction that currently applies only during lesson time.The ministry of education (MOE) announced the new rules on November 30, saying they are intended to curb digital distractions and promote healthier screen habits, reported Gulf news.Under the revised policy, students must store devices in lockers or bags not just during classes, but also through recess, co-curricular activities and remedial sessions. Schools may grant exceptions “where necessary,” the ministry said.Citing research on excessive screen exposure, the MOE noted that “screen use among students has been shown to displace important activities such as sleep, physical activity and social interactions.” The ministry added that reducing in-school device dependence is part of a broader effort to improve student wellbeing.Alongside the new restrictions, default ‘sleep hours’ on government-issued learning devices will shift from 11pm to 10.30pm starting January.Parents who have opted out of after-school limits have been urged to adopt the earlier cutoff at home.The move aligns with a growing global push to limit digital distractions in schools. UNESCO estimates that about 40 per cent of education systems now impose smartphone bans. Australia is set to introduce a nationwide bar on social media use for those under 16 next week, while China’s Zhengzhou district requires parents to justify why a child needs a phone “for pedagogical reasons.”The MOE said schools will work closely with parents and reinforce Cyber Wellness education to help students build healthier online habits.","Singapore will require all secondary school students to keep their smartphones and smartwatches locked away for the entire duration of the school day from January 2026.

How the selection and registration works





New system upgrades and early registration





Quota, oversight, and support









Qatar is gearing up to welcome pilgrims for the Hajj 1447 AH season as the Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs (Awqaf) launches its electronic selection process. Starting December 2, 2025, the Hajj and Umrah Affairs Department will guide shortlisted applicants through a digital system designed to make registration smooth, transparent, and efficient. This initiative also gives operators the ability to plan trips effectively, ensuring top quality services for pilgrims.Pilgrims who are shortlisted will receive an SMS notifying them of their approval. Once notified, they have seven days to complete the registration process with one of the 24 accredited Hajj operators through the official website, www.hajj.gov.qa. Missing this deadline will result in automatic cancellation.During registration, applicants are required to pay an advance of QAR 10,000. This is part of the total Hajj cost, not a separate registration fee, and the final price depends on the services chosen, including accommodation and transportation. Pilgrims must also sign an electronic contract selecting their preferred operator through the online system.The advance payment ensures that applicants are serious about performing Hajj.It also helps operators plan their trips carefully, making sure all arrangements are ready for pilgrims’ arrival. Applicants are encouraged to review the services and costs of each operator, as they may vary in terms of residency, hospitality, and transportation.This year, the electronic system comes with a smoother online payment mechanism, allowing pilgrims to pay comfortably according to the prices set by their chosen operator. Building on the success of previous seasons, early registration is now open, giving operators the chance to finalize contracts and organize trips well in advance.These upgrades aim to provide a seamless pilgrimage experience. Pilgrims can focus on performing Hajj in a calm and organized setting while benefiting from high quality services.Qatar’s quota for this season is set at 4,400 pilgrims. The electronic selection process fully respects this allocation and follows established standards. Awqaf is working closely with the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah in Saudi Arabia, along with other relevant authorities, to ensure the pilgrimage runs smoothly and meets the expectations of Qatar’s pilgrims.For any questions about registration, selection, or services, pilgrims can contact the hotline at 132. The ministry emphasized that these coordinated efforts reflect its commitment to providing an organized, transparent, and fulfilling Hajj experience for all pilgrims from Qatar.","Qatar is gearing up to welcome pilgrims for the Hajj 1447 AH season.

Qatar's Hayya Visa upgrade

Two months and multiple entries

Extended Stay: Residents of GCC nations (including the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, and Kuwait) can now stay in Qatar for up to two months (60 days) on a single Hayya visa application. This extended duration provides ample time for visitors to explore cultural sites, natural attractions, and the packed calendar of year-round events.



Multiple-Entry Access: The new visa grants multiple-entry access. This means visitors can travel in and out of Qatar throughout the season without needing to reapply each time, greatly facilitating short, frequent trips for events or weekend getaways from neighboring countries.



What is the Hayya Platform?

Integrated Services: Hayya integrates visa processing with other essential travel elements, including event access, accommodation booking, transport planning, and general lifestyle services



Official Entry Document: Originally launched for the 2022 FIFA World Cup , the Hayya system successfully processed entry permits for millions of fans, and it continues to serve as the mandatory entry document for specified categories of visitors, including those utilizing the new GCC Resident Visa (A2).



Why did Qatar make the move?





From 30 November 2025, Qatar expanded the Hayya GCC Resident Visa (A2): eligible residents of GCC countries can now stay in Qatar for up to two months and enter the country multiple times during the visa’s validity. The update was announced by Qatar Tourism in coordination with the Ministry of Interior and the committee managing visitor entry as the country prepares for a busy winter of sports and cultural events.Qatar has rolled out significant enhancements to its Hayya GCC Residents Visa (Category A2), dramatically simplifying travel for expatriates living across the Gulf.

They mark a key moment for the Hayya platform, which serves as Qatar's official digital e-visa gateway, uniting visa processing with essential travel and lifestyle services into a single, comprehensive interface.The core of the Hayya update offers two major benefits that significantly improve flexibility and convenience for GCC residents:This updated system is engineered to ensure smoother entry through all ports of arrival, air, land, and sea, strengthening Qatar's operational readiness during peak visitor periods.The name ""Hayya"" (هَيّا) literally translates from Arabic to ""Let's Go!"" or ""Come On!"", perfectly reflecting its purpose as Qatar’s main facilitator for welcoming visitors.The platform is far more than just a visa application portal. It serves as Qatar's unified official digital e-visa gateway, designed to provide a seamless travel experience from the moment a visitor plans their trip:This comprehensive, digital-first approach embodies Qatar's vision to modernize its tourism sector and make entry into the country as efficient and appealing as possible.The timing of the Hayya upgrade is strategic, coinciding with a high-profile season of sports and cultural activities set to draw large crowds from the GCC region.The primary immediate driver is the 2025 FIFA Arab Cup. By simplifying access for regional fans, Qatar aims to maximize spectator numbers for this major tournament. The move also supports a vibrant line-up of surrounding cultural and entertainment events, encouraging attendees to extend their stays beyond the stadiums.Saeed Al Kuwari, Director of Hayya, emphasized that the new measures are more than just procedural tweaks.

Maintain a safe distance from other vehicles. Yield to pedestrians and emergency vehicles at all times. Wear your seatbelt and ensure children are seated safely in the car.

Regularly check your black points through apps, SMS notifications, or official websites.





Driving in the UAE comes with responsibilities, and the Black Points System is at the heart of keeping roads safe for everyone. Introduced to curb reckless driving and reduce accidents, it assigns points to your license for traffic violations. Accumulating these points can lead to hefty fines, vehicle impoundment, or even license suspension. For both residents and visitors, understanding how black points work, which violations carry them, and how to check your status is essential. Staying informed can help you avoid penalties and ensure a smoother, safer driving experience across all emirates.Black points are penalties assigned to a driver’s license for traffic violations. Introduced in July 2017 under Ministerial Resolution No. 178/2017, the system applies across all UAE emirates, including Dubai and Abu Dhabi.Violations are recorded using an advanced network of cameras, radars, and AI-powered monitoring systems. Once a violation is detected and confirmed, drivers typically receive an SMS notification within 48 hours detailing the offense, the fine, and the number of black points added.The system is designed not only to penalize drivers financially but also to track repeat offenses, which can ultimately lead to license suspension or mandatory retraining. It ensures safer roads and consistently encourages responsible driving behavior, moreover supporting long-term compliance.The UAE uses a 24 point scale to manage driving penalties:License suspension periods are based on how many times the 24 point limit is reached:Drivers can monitor their black points in several ways:In addition to black points, violations can also result in hefty fines, vehicle impoundment, and a daily impoundment fee of Dh100.The UAE enforces 143 federal traffic laws, each with penalties to maintain road discipline. Some of the most common violations include:These penalties are carefully designed to encourage responsible driving and protect all road users.Checking your black points is simple and can help you avoid penalties:Regular monitoring ensures you are aware of your points and prevents unexpected license suspensions or retraining requirements.By following these practices, drivers can stay safe, avoid fines, and prevent their license from being suspended.","Black points are penalties assigned to a driver’s license for traffic violations.

“Tommy just lost 50% of his supporters with this one move!”

“Nick Fuentes defends extremism abroad while aiming at the wrong targets at home.”

“People are saying the timing of his Israel trip explains everything — and it’s no coincidence.”

“Fuentes is a Qatari-backed spy-op sent to split the movement — wake up!”

“Shouldn’t you be focusing on England instead of picking fights online?”

“He’s part of the very system he claims to fight against.”

“Fuentes has answered the January 6 question countless times — stop trying to paint him as a fed.”

“America has no idea how Islamic communities operate — Tommy needs to get on US podcasts and explain it.”

“Fuentes has no clue what it’s like living near Islamic neighbourhoods — he’s speaking from a bubble.”

“Your constant alignment with Israel is hurting your own cause — this isn’t helping you.”





A new online dispute has broken out between Tommy Robinson and American commentator Nick Fuentes, after Fuentes referred to Robinson as a “Zionist tool” in a circulating clip. The video, shared widely across X, shows Fuentes accusing Robinson of being used to provoke clashes in Britain and to undermine pro-Palestinian demonstrations.

FBI Cracks Jan 6 Pipe Bomb Plot; Suspect Brian Cole Arrested | Watch What Happened In 2021

$500,000 reward and dead ends

The arrest





After 5 years of a manhunt, federal authorities finally arrested Brian Cole, the man accused of placing pipe bombs near the Democratic and Republican National Committee offices the night before the Jan 6 Capitol riot. Cole was living in Woodbridge, Virginia, before he was taken into custody.On the evening of 5 January 2021, Cole allegedly placed two homemade pipe bombs near the DNC and RNC headquarters. The devices were made from 1×8‑inch galvanized metal pipes, filled with homemade black powder, and fitted with a kitchen timer for detonation. Neither device exploded, but officials described them as capable of causing serious injury or death.Surveillance footage captured the suspect wearing Nike shoes, a dark hoodie, and glasses, reportedly carrying a backpack containing the bombs. The devices were later found and safely recovered by the FBI.For almost five years, authorities struggled to identify the individual in the grainy, low-quality surveillance images. Investigators reviewed tens of thousands of video files, interviewed hundreds of witnesses, and analysed digital and geolocation data to determine where the suspect actually went after planting the bombs.A $500,000 reward was issued to any person who would provide helpful details about the criminal. But it was all for nothing.Lawmakers questioned how security failures allowed the bombs to remain undetected for nearly 17 hours. The FBI continued to release updated video footage and physical descriptions, estimating the suspect at around 5′7″ tall.The breakthrough came in December 2025, when investigators were able to link new forensic evidence and video analysis to Brian Cole. Authorities executed a warrant at his home in Woodbridge, taking him into custody without incident. Formal charges have not yet been publicly released, but officials confirmed the arrest closes one of the longest-running mysteries tied to the January 6 riots.","Brian Cole was arrested in Virginia after a five-year manhunt.

Conservative commentator Steven Crowder stirred a row during a conversation about H-1B visas when he said: If India has so many bright and talented people, why do they come to the United States instead of making India an “America No. 2.”In a talk with a young man, Crowder said that if H-1B visas are so great, then why does “India still look like India?”The youth asked, “Look like India? What do you mean?”Crowder then described India in a sly way, calling it a poor and backwards country where people lack basic healthcare and necessities, where diseases still exist that developed nations eradicated, and where hundredes and thousands die from ""snake bites."" He then said, “That’s not a joke. It’s a third world country.”Steven admitted that Indians work in large numbers in tech and engineering. The youth responded that people, especially Americans should not stereotype or judge someone else’s culture and also pointed out the fact that there must be a reason for Indians to leave their own country an come work in US. He said developed countries often use the term ""third world"" to describe places that are less urbanized and that different countries have different priorities and values.Ironically, a user commented on the video of the conversation and asked Grok AI whether Steven Crowder has ever visited India. The AI replied that Steven’s experience is mostly limited to American and Canadian contexts. Social media users then called Crowder privileged and full of himself for judging a place he has never been to and for not understanding the obstacles faced in the third world.Last month, during an appearance on ""Piers Morgan Uncensored,"" Crowder called Indians ""physically feeble people,"" who should not work in construction.Steven Crowder is an American-Canadian conservative commentator known for his pushy, confrontational political style and his show ""Louder With Crowder.""

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Meet Charlie Javice: Woman who scammed JP Morgan for $175M — but the bank is paying her $142M legal bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meet-charlie-javice-woman-who-scammed-jp-morgan-for-175m-but-the-bank-is-paying-her-142m-legal-bills/articleshow/125369591.cms,"How a startup deal turned into a massive fraud

A conviction that didn’t stop the bills

The controversial expenses

Why JPMorgan cannot simply stop paying

Charlie Javice’s story sounds almost too bizarre to be real: a young fintech founder who tricked JPMorgan into buying her startup for $175 million, ended up convicted of fraud, and is now serving a prison sentence, yet the same company she scammed is still paying more than $142 million for her legal bills, including questionable expenses like luxury hotel upgrades and “cellulite butter. ”Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid. When JPMorgan considered acquiring the startup in 2021, she reportedly presented the bank with millions of supposed student user accounts. Prosecutors later revealed that these numbers had been fabricated, with Javice allegedly hiring a data scientist to generate fake profiles to inflate Frank’s value.JPMorgan completed the acquisition believing Frank had more than four million users, only to discover after the deal that the platform had a tiny fraction of that. The bank alerted authorities, and by 2023 Javice was arrested on federal fraud charges.In March 2025, Javice was convicted of multiple fraud counts and sentenced to more than seven years in prison. But here’s where the story takes an unusual twist: despite defrauding the bank, she is still allowed to bill JPMorgan for her legal defence because of an indemnification clause included in the acquisition agreement.This contractual protection, which is common in startup buyouts, requires JPMorgan to cover certain legal costs for former executives of Frank.As a result, the bank has already paid over $142 million in defence expenses for Javice and her former colleague Olivier Amar.The clause itself is a standard feature in mergers, designed to protect executives from being financially ruined by lawsuits connected to their time at the company. In normal situations, it is meant to ensure fairness and prevent frivolous legal targeting after an acquisition. But in this case, it has trapped JPMorgan in a bizarre obligation: they must keep funding the defence of someone who defrauded them.Had the bank conducted even a simple, early-stage verification of Frank’s user data—such as requesting direct access to the platform’s actual customer records or running a basic audit—this entire dispute could have been avoided. Instead, delayed due diligence and overconfidence in the startup’s claims set the stage for a costly legal mess that continues years after the fraud was uncovered.JPMorgan’s frustration has grown as the legal bills have ballooned. The bank claims the expenses submitted include personal items such as cellulite butter, first-class travel upgrades, and hotel luxuries. Its lawyers argue that the billing records contain “extreme abuses,” including claims for work hours that seem physically impossible.Javice’s spokesperson denies that she personally submitted these questionable charges, stating that her legal team is responsible for all billing decisions.Even though Javice has already been convicted, she is now appealing her case, and the indemnification clause means the bank must continue paying her legal fees unless a court orders otherwise. JPMorgan is currently trying to convince a Delaware judge to halt these payments, arguing that the system is being misused.The saga has become a major lesson in the risks of fast-paced startup acquisitions. JPMorgan’s failure to properly verify Frank’s user base before buying the company has left it entangled in one of the most embarrassing and expensive due diligence failures in recent corporate history.","Charlie Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid.

The risk of superintelligent systems that humanity cannot control



AI could make war cheaper, bloodless and politically irresistible

Deepfakes could destroy elections and public trust



A civilisation-level threat unless regulation catches up





Geoffrey Hinton, widely known as the “godfather of AI”, has delivered one of his starkest warnings yet, arguing that the world’s most powerful tech billionaires are pushing artificial intelligence forward at a pace that could destabilise economies, erase millions of jobs and unleash forces humanity may not be able to control. Speaking in a public conversation with US Senator Bernie Sanders at Georgetown University, Hinton said the unchecked ambitions of Silicon Valley’s richest men risk triggering an AI-driven crisis with no safety net in place.Hinton singled out Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison and Jeff Bezos, noting that they are investing hundreds of billions into AI and robotics while failing to grasp the long-term consequences. According to Hinton, their race to dominate the AI frontier risks undermining the very economic system that made them wealthy.“They haven’t really thought through that if workers don’t get paid, there’s nobody to buy their products,” he said, warning that Silicon Valley’s obsession with automation could backfire on the companies leading it.Unlike past industrial revolutions, Hinton believes AI will not replace old jobs with new ones at anything close to a sustainable rate.He warned that once AI becomes as smart as humans or smarter it will be able to perform virtually any task people currently do.“The people who lose their jobs won’t have other jobs to go to,” he said. “Any job they might do can be done by AI.”Call-centre roles, administrative work, junior technical roles and basic analysis tasks, he noted, are only the beginning. What follows could be structural unemployment on a scale modern economies have never experienced.Hinton cautioned that today’s AI systems already “know thousands of times more than any one person” and are rapidly improving. Many of the world’s top AI researchers, he said, believe it is inevitable that AI will surpass human intelligence, and no one knows how humanity will coexist with something smarter than itself.He described a scenario in which advanced AI agents develop sub-goals such as self-preservation and the desire for greater control, making them increasingly resistant to human oversight.“We’ve already seen AIs attempt to deceive people who try to turn them off,” he warned.One of Hinton’s most disturbing predictions involves the future of warfare. He argued that AI-powered drones and humanoid robots could allow rich nations to wage war without risking the lives of their own citizens. That removes one of the major political pressures that currently restrains military aggression.“Rich countries could invade poor countries and only the poor would die,” Hinton said. “There would be no political blowback when there are no soldiers coming home in boxes.”Hinton said AI systems will soon be able to generate fake videos and audio indistinguishable from reality, eroding the integrity of elections and public discourse. Attempts to build AI that detect fakes will fail, he argued, because generative models will always be able to outsmart detection systems.“We have to rely on provenance, not detection,” he said, suggesting digital signatures to prove the authenticity of political videos.Both Hinton and Sanders agreed that governments are failing to regulate AI at even the most basic level. Safety testing requirements, restrictions on biological misuse and transparency obligations for companies remain largely absent in the US and many other countries.Hinton warned that unless governments enforce strict oversight, the consequences could be catastrophic.“We ought not build systems smarter than us until we know how people can coexist with them,” he said. “Right now, we simply don’t.”",Geoffrey Hinton warns that the world’s most powerful tech billionaires are pushing artificial intelligence forward at a pace that could destabilise economies.

Addressing the challenges faced by millions of Indian students, the app offers AI-powered course matching, real-time tracking, and faster decision-making, making studying abroad simpler and more transparent.





Edvoy app availabilty and how it works













Edvoy has launched a fully integrated app that replaces the traditional agent-driven and paperwork-heavy admissions process with a single digital workflow. Built for scale, the platform unifies course search, documentation, counselling, accommodation and education finance, creating a category that did not exist until now. The launch arrives at a critical moment where more than 1.8 million Indian students are preparing to move overseas in 2025, yet most still navigate their journey through scattered agents, WhatsApp threads, bank portals and manually uploaded documents that increasingly fail compliance checks. Edvoy’s app consolidates the entire journey in one place, supported by multi-stage verification, real-time tracking and access to more than 75,000+ courses across 750+ universities.The Edvoy app is now available for download on Google Play and Apple Store. Students, parents and counselors can access the full suite of study abroad tools by installing the app.Despite rapid growth in student mobility, the current study abroad process remains fractured. Students often move between agents, email threads, WhatsApp messages, bank portals and university websites. The Edvoy app replaces this patchwork with a single interface where students can explore more than 75,000 courses across 750 institutions, compare programmes and complete a 100% paperless document upload.All submitted documents undergo Edvoy’s multi-stage compliance review. The workflow detects fraudulent activity and prepares students for CAS and integrity checks, which are now mandatory in major destinations. Students can track the status of their applications in real time, reducing uncertainty and ensuring transparency at every stage.A standout feature of the app is Genie, Edvoy’s AI course matching tool. Genie analyses academic history, English language scores, study gaps, budget and regional rules, then categorises results into three tiers and provides a predictive score for admission likelihood. This helps students identify realistic options within seconds and understand how their profile aligns with institutional requirements.The app also offers Express Offers for decisions from select institutions within 24 hours. Students can access one-to-one expert counselling, chat instantly with advisors or book video sessions in under a minute. Continuous guidance is available throughout the application, financial and accommodation stages.To simplify financial planning, the platform supports secure deposit and application fee payments. Students can compare education loans from more than 15 banks and NBFCs, check eligibility instantly and complete the application fully online. Approvals can be obtained in as little as three days.For accommodation, the app provides access to verified properties across more than 700 university cities. Students can compare options and pre-book their stay directly through the platform.The new app serves as a single destination for the entire international admissions lifecycle, covering course search, documentation, counselling, financial planning and housing.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai celebrates new breakthrough in quantum algorithm; Elon Musk replies: ‘Looks like…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-celebrates-new-breakthrough-in-quantum-algorithm-elon-musk-replies-looks-like/articleshow/124754841.cms,"



What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”
