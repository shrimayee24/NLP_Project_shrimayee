"Apple Foldable iPhone: Apple may launch foldable iPhone in 2026, offering design similar to Samsung Galaxy Z Flip",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/apple-may-launch-foldable-iphone-in-2026-offering-design-similar-to-samsung-galaxy-z-flip/articleshow/127851956.cms,"5 Key things you missed at Apple iPhone launch event

Apple is reportedly preparing yo enter the foldable smartphone market. However, the company is still several months away from unveiling its first foldable iPhone, a device positioned at the very top of the lineup to create a halo effect across the portfolio. Apple’s first foldable iPhone is said to feature a book-style design, opening horizontally just like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold series. However, now a new online report suggests that the Cupertino-based tech giant is considering a smaller clamshell design for its first foldable iPhone.According to a report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple is exploring the idea of introducing a smaller and compact clamshell-style foldable iPhone. Informally referred to as the ‘iPhone Flip’, the smartphone would fold vertically and turn into a compact square form factor similar to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip and the Motorola Razr. Gurman adds that the prototypes of such designs have been tested inside Apple labs but it is not clear as to when the product will reach the customers.“Now there’s another foldable device under consideration inside Apple labs (and it won’t come as a shock given what Motorola and Samsung Electronics Co.have already done): a square, clamshell-style foldable phone. Apple is betting that its first foldable iPhone will be successful enough to generate real demand for the category and that customers will want additional shapes and sizes, much as they have with traditional slab-style iPhones,” adds the report.Apple has also been working on a giant foldable iPad, but that project has reportedly hit development snags. The company’s focus now appears to be on foldable iPhones, with multiple form factors under consideration to appeal to different segments of the market.","Apple is reportedly preparing to enter the foldable smartphone market.

Technology is growing faster than ever in today's world, which is changing quickly. AI, or artificial intelligence, is a part of our lives every day, even if we don't always notice it. AI works behind the scenes in a lot of things, like search engines, mobile phones, office software, and online shopping. Some people are excited about this change, while others are worried about losing their jobs or becoming less important. A strong quote from Sam Altman gives clarity and hope in this situation. He says, ""AI won't take over for people."" But people who use AI will take the place of those who don't. This simple line reminds us that machines don't own the future. People who are willing to learn, change, and grow with technology, instead of running away from it, own it.At first, it might seem like Sam Altman's quote is too direct or harsh.

We shouldn't be afraid of it; we should get ready for it.AI isn't just for scientists or big businesses anymore. Now it's a part of everyday life. People use AI when they:These tools cut down on work and save time. They help people concentrate on being creative, solving problems, and growing as people. People who learn how to use these tools wisely often find that work is easier and more productive.AI is powerful, but it cannot replicate everything that makes people unique. Creativity, emotional intelligence, moral judgement, and imagination are still uniquely human traits.A machine can give you information, but it cannot feel sorry for you. It can analyse data, but it cannot truly grasp how people feel. That is why individuals with both technical capabilities and values will always be valued.This viewpoint is supported by a quote from Sam Altman. It claims that success stems from the combination of intelligence and compassion.This quote reminds students to learn new things as well as do their regular schoolwork. Learning about technology early on can help you in many ways later on.For people who work, this is a sign to keep learning new things. Learning never stops, especially in this digital age.

Hasan Piker back on Twitch as platform shortens suspension to three days,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/hasan-piker-back-on-twitch-as-platform-shortens-suspension-to-three-days/articleshow/127870730.cms,"Image Via Instagram

Hasan Piker returns after appeal shortens Twitch ban





Hasan Piker, also known as HasanAbi, has come back to Twitch after serving a suspension that lasted for three days. Initially, the streamer was supposed to serve a seven-day ban, but the period was reduced after he appealed the suspension. Twitch has not yet released an official reason for the suspension of the streamer, which is a common practice on the platform. The details of the enforcement are usually provided to the streamer privately, while the public statements are kept to a minimum. Hasan’s return to the platform has attracted a lot of attention, especially due to his massive following.According to reports, the suspension came as a result of comments Hasan made in a live stream, where he used the phraseAlthough Twitch did not state that this was the reason for the suspension, it is likely that it contributed to the suspension. After considering the appeal, it appears that Twitch decided that the offense was not as severe as previously thought. This resulted in the suspension being reduced, which allowed Hasan to return to streaming earlier than expected.During the suspension, Hasan did not distance himself from live streaming.Instead, he relocated to YouTube and continued his usual political commentary and news-based live streams. This did not seem to affect his popularity. It is reported that his live streams on YouTube received good viewership, indicating that his fans followed him wherever he went.The YouTube live streams also created a considerable amount of financial support. During one of the Friday live streams, Hasan allegedly raised between $15,000 and $18,000 in donations. The donations were intended to be given to immigration advocacy groups, including the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights in Los Angeles. This action was consistent with his previous emphasis on political and social issues.Hasan Piker is one of the most popular political streamers on Twitch, recognized for his daily long-form streams that include commentary on current events, media analysis, and social issues. Prior to becoming a full-time streamer, he worked with The Young Turks, which contributed to his on-stream personality and audience.Ultimately, Hasan’s swift return demonstrates both the power he wields and the dynamic nature of Twitch’s moderation policy. This case also illustrates the increasingly difficult task that platforms face in attempting to balance enforcement, free speech, and user experience.","Hasan Piker, also known as HasanAbi, has come back to Twitch after serving a suspension that lasted for three days.

Clash Royale Bug Fixes Address Stat Inconsistencies

Overall Meta Outlook

Key projected trends:

Supercell released theon February 2, targeting several dominant cards while strengthening a few that had fallen out of competitive decks. The patch focuses on slowing down high-pressure strategies, improving counterplay, and bringing more variety to the ladder and tournament meta.The update includes nerfs to popular Heroes and Evolutions, buffs to underused cards, one notable rework, and minor stat fixes. Below is a complete breakdown of every change and what it could mean once the meta settles.The strongest cards from recent seasons received adjustments designed to reduce their reliability without removing them from competitive play.Hero Mini P.E.K.K.A had been charging his level-up ability too quickly, allowing players to cycle into powered states with little downtime. The longer cooking time slows that progression and forces more deliberate timing.This change weakens fast cycle decks that relied on repeated ability activation. The card should remain viable, but players will need better elixir management instead of depending on frequent power spikes.The evolved Witch had become difficult to remove because destroyed Skeletons restored too much health. Lower healing reduces her survivability during extended fights.Poison, Fireball, and high burst damage regain importance when facing Witch pushes. Expect fewer drawn-out defensive stands anchored by her healing.Since gaining Hero status, Giant has been one of the safest frontline tanks in ranked play. Even a small health reduction matters because tanks often survive with minimal HP.Tower trades become less forgiving for Giant users. Defensive buildings and tank killers should produce more consistent stops.Previously, Skeletons could spawn directly on Crown Towers, leaving defenders almost no reaction window. The new pattern allows slightly more time to respond.Prediction spells and instant counters become less necessary. Graveyard should still threaten damage, but it will feel less unavoidable.After receiving a range buff earlier, Minions began outperforming other air troops in both offense and defense.This opens space for alternatives such as Mega Minion and air splash units. Minions remain efficient but are no longer the automatic choice.Their November rework improved close-range damage too much, making them harder to contain once they crossed the bridge.Bridge-spam variants lose some burst potential. Players who invest nine elixir must now support the card more carefully instead of relying on raw damage.Several underused cards received boosts intended to make them realistic options again.Hero Wizard’s ability sometimes failed to group troops tightly enough for his fireball follow-up. The stronger pull improves consistency.Control decks benefit the most. Better troop clustering increases spell value and defensive efficiency.Even after previous improvements, the evolved Drill struggled to pressure opponents. Doubling the Goblins creates a more meaningful threat if ignored.Chip damage strategies gain reliability. Defenders must commit resources instead of brushing it off.• Small characters: 409 → 430• Medium characters: 778 → 819• Large characters: 1477 → 1551The Evolution had fallen behind other bridge-spam tools. More healing helps it survive multi-unit defenses.Expect renewed interest in heavier counterpush decks. If protected properly, an evolved P.E.K.K.A can now remain on the board longer and convert defense into offense.The previous deploy-time nerf made the turret feel slow, but its long range allowed it to lock onto Crown Towers too easily. The rework trades reach for responsiveness.Players gain faster defensive utility, while opponents get clearer ways to avoid turret pressure on towers. The card should feel more interactive rather than oppressive.Two minor adjustments were made to correct level interactions:• Balloon: Hitpoints reduced slightly from 1679 to 1676.• Barbarian Barrel: Damage increased from 230 to 232.These fixes ensure that certain card interactions behave consistently across levels, including removing Wall Breakers with the Barbarian Barrel plus Electro Spirit combination and correcting Hunter’s attack count against Balloon.The February update appears designed to slow the pace of matches without drastically reshaping the game.• Tank pushes should be easier to defend after the Giant nerf.• Graveyard becomes more manageable, reducing frustration in ladder play.• Control strategies gain tools through Hero Wizard.• Bridge-spam may return if P.E.K.K.A Evolution performs as expected.• Deck variety should improve as Minions and Three Musketeers lose some efficiency.Rather than introducing extreme power shifts, this patch focuses on tightening balance and reducing low-counterplay situations.If the changes land as intended, players should see fewer repetitive deck archetypes and more room for adaptation and this is a sign that Supercell is prioritizing long-term stability over short-term disruption.","Supercell released Clash Royale balance update on February 2.

This Chinese man ‘Alchemist’ extracted 191 grams of gold from SIM cards turning junk into treasure worth millions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/this-chinese-man-alchemist-extracted-191-grams-of-gold-from-sim-cards-turning-junk-into-treasure-worth-millions/articleshow/127875719.cms,"Source: SCMP

A Southern Chinese man extracts 191 grams of gold from scrapping SIM cards



Who is the man behind the process







On January 20 2026, a southern Chinese man's video surfaced online, who reportedly managed to extract 191 grams of gold from discarded SIMs. This triggered a further surge in demand for used SIM cards. The Chinese man commonly referred to as “Qiao” from Huizhou, Guangdong province, specialising in refining previous scrap metal, was reportedly behind the process.The extracted gold after filtering and heating reveals the worth, which is around 200,000 Yuan or approximately 27 lakhs. According to the South China Morning Post, this extraction may seem like a small DIY project, but it is far more complex than it seems in reality.The video went viral when Qiao poured stacks of used SIM cards into barrels of heat and corrosion. The scrap SIM card prices have reportedly shot up, and vendors are selling faster than they can stock. Some buyers say they want to mimic Qiao’s method.There’s fascination with the idea that you could pull gold from what looks like junk. But as Qiao warns, amateurs might be hurt, but one misstep could lead to chemical burns or worse.The modern SIM card typically contains less than 0.001 gram of gold, which means you would need approximately 400,000 cards to replicate Qiao’s recent results. What seems simple involves a complex process for extraction, which is termed Aqua Regia, that is, highly corrosive water. Experts warn: one mistake could lead to the release of lethal explosive gases.Qiao comes from Huizhou in Guangdong province. He’s a scrap metal refiner by trade. People online have dubbed him the “alchemist.” He reportedly told local media that the gold didn’t just come from SIM cards but with other discarded electronic chips helped make the total 191 grams.As reported, experts say it’s illegal in some regions to handle such chemicals without proper permits and is also dangerous. Qiao’s gold extraction might look like fun but it’s not a DIY hobby.","A Southern Chinese man extracts 191 grams of gold from scrapped SIM cards.

"Stanford students pretend to be Jains to escape $7,944 mandatory meal plan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/stanford-students-pretend-to-be-jains-to-escape-7944-mandatory-meal-plan/articleshow/127872443.cms,"How Jain identity entered the Stanford dining debate

Online reaction and wider debate





A Stanford student essay claimed that some undergraduates falsely identify as Jain to bypass the university’s $7,944 mandatory meal plan. The allegation, which has circulated widely on social media, suggests that students use religious dietary exemptions to redirect their dining funds to off-campus grocery stores such as Whole Foods, where they believe food options are fresher or better suited to their preferences. The claim is based on anecdotal observations and student conversations rather than official university records.The controversy stems from an opinion essay written by Stanford undergraduate Sebastian Connolly and published in The New York Times. Connolly described a campus culture of “optimisation,” arguing that students openly discuss ways to work around rules, including claiming Jain identity to qualify for dining exemptions. The essay did not present institutional figures or disciplinary cases, instead relying on personal observation and student conversations.Jainism has strict dietary principles that emphasise non-violence toward all living beings. Followers typically follow a strict vegetarian diet, avoiding meat, fish, eggs, and foods that involve harm to living organisms. Many Jains also avoid root vegetables such as onions, garlic, potatoes, and carrots, as harvesting them can kill the entire plant and disturb microorganisms in the soil.Because of these constraints, many universities, including Stanford, allow religious accommodations when campus dining cannot reasonably meet such requirements. Students granted exemptions may be permitted to opt out of standard meal plans and spend dining funds elsewhere.Stanford requires most undergraduates living on campus to enrol in a meal plan. The university also states that exemptions can be granted for documented religious or medical reasons. However, the institution does not publicly release data on how many students claim religious dietary exemptions, how those claims are reviewed, or whether misuse is investigated.The claim has fuelled wider debate over the cost of college meal plans, the quality of campus dining, and how accommodation systems are used. Some commentators say it reflects growing frustration among students with expensive and inflexible dining rules. Others caution that unverified allegations should not be confused with the practices of the religion itself, noting that the issue, if it exists, concerns individual behaviour rather than Jain dietary traditions.Beyond Stanford, the issue points to a wider strain across universities. Students are facing rising costs and limited flexibility, pushing some to look for any lawful way to stretch their budgets. At the same time, universities depend on trust-based systems to honour genuine religious and medical needs without turning accommodations into an exercise in policing identity.","Stanford student essay claimed that some undergraduates falsely identify as Jain to bypass the university’s $7,944 mandatory meal plan.

Lucy Letby Netflix documentary: Why UK baby-killer nurse’s parents call it ‘invasion of privacy’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/lucy-letby-netflix-documentary-why-uk-baby-killer-nurses-parents-call-it-invasion-of-privacy-explained/articleshow/127847789.cms,"‘We will not watch it’: Parents condemn documentary

Use of family home footage sparks privacy concerns

Questions Raised Over Police Cooperation

Who Is Lucy Letby?





A new Netflix documentary on convicted British neonatal nurse Lucy Letby has sparked fresh controversy in the UK, with her parents accusing the streaming giant of a “complete invasion of privacy” for allegedly using footage of their family home without consent.The Investigation of Lucy Letby, set to stream from February 4 on Netflix, promises viewers “unseen footage and unheard insider accounts” from one of Britain’s most disturbing criminal cases.However, even before its release, the series has drawn criticism from Letby’s family, reopening debates around ethics, victimhood and privacy in true-crime storytelling.Lucy Letby’s parents, Susan and John Letby, have said they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.In a statement to The Guardian, the couple said previous media coverage, including televised images of their daughter being led away in handcuffs, had already been “heartbreaking,” but claimed the Netflix production crossed a new line.“This documentary is on another level,” they said. “We will not watch it. It would likely kill us if we did.”A major point of contention for the Letbys is the alleged inclusion of footage filmed inside or around their long-time family home, without their knowledge.The couple said they were unaware that the documentary would feature images of the house where they have lived for more than 40 years, located in a small town where, they say, “everyone knows everyone.”They also criticised a clip shown in the documentary’s trailer, which reportedly depicts Lucy Letby being arrested in her bedroom and saying goodbye to one of her cats.“All this taking place in the home where we have lived for decades,” they said, calling it “a complete invasion of privacy.”The parents further questioned why an investigating officer involved in the case was permitted to discuss or show what occurred inside their home on the day of Letby’s arrest.“We always cooperated fully,” they said, asking why Netflix and the production company did not inform them before using such material.Netflix and ITN Productions, which produced the documentary, have not publicly responded to these claims.Lucy Letby, born 4 January 1990, is a former neonatal nurse who worked at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England. She came under suspicion after an unusually high number of infant deaths occurred in the neonatal unit between June 2015 and June 2016.After a lengthy investigation, Letby was charged in November 2020 with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder involving newborn babies.In August 2023, she was convicted of seven counts of murder and seven counts of attempted murder.She received a whole-life prison sentence, meaning she will never be eligible for release. In July 2024, she was also found guilty in a retrial of an attempted murder charge on which the jury had previously failed to reach a verdict.Letby is currently incarcerated at HMP Low Newton in Durham.","Lucy Letby’s parents say they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.

Dubai’s ultra-modern Metro system is known for being fast, clean and efficient but breaking the rules can cost commuters from Dh100 to a hefty Dh2,000. As the city’s public transport usage surges, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has reinforced a comprehensive list of penalties aimed at ensuring safety, cleanliness and smooth operations across stations and trains.From fare evasion and smoking to tampering with emergency equipment, the penalties cover everything from minor etiquette breaches to serious safety violations and they are strictly enforced.With millions of passengers using the Metro every day, Dubai’s transport authorities have increasingly focused on discipline, safety and passenger experience. Officials say the fines are designed not to punish but to encourage responsible commuting and protect public safety.According to RTA guidance, penalties range widely depending on severity, with behavioural infractions attracting smaller fines and safety-related violations attracting the maximum penalties.The most common fines come from everyday mistakes that many commuters may not realise are violations. Watch out as Dh100 fines include:These are considered etiquette or behavioural breaches but can still add up if repeated frequently.More serious violations relate to fare evasion, cleanliness and misuse of transport services. Watch out as Dh200 fines include:As for Dh500 fines, they include:These penalties aim to discourage fare fraud and maintain the Metro’s strict cleanliness standards.Sleeping in prohibited areas including shelters and restricted zones, carries a Dh300 fine, highlighting how even seemingly harmless actions can attract penalties.The highest fines are reserved for actions that could endanger passengers or disrupt operations. Watch out as Dh1,000 fines include:Meanwhile, Dh2,000 fines include:These violations are treated seriously due to the potential risk to lives and infrastructure.Metro users driving to stations also face penalties. Vehicles parked beyond permitted times at Metro car parks can attract Dh100 per day fines, capped at Dh1,000. Transport experts say strict penalties are part of Dubai’s strategy to maintain global-standard public transport systems.The city aims to keep its Metro safe, hygienic and efficient, especially as ridership grows due to tourism, population expansion and sustainability initiatives. RTA officials stress that compliance with signage and inspector instructions is crucial to preventing overcrowding, accidents and disruptions.Dubai’s Metro is central to the emirate’s smart mobility and sustainability goals, reducing traffic congestion and carbon emissions. Ensuring passengers follow rules helps keep the system reliable, a key factor as Dubai prepares for major expansions like new lines and rising commuter volumes.Commuter checklist:Dubai Metro fines range from Dh100 for minor etiquette breaches to Dh2,000 for serious safety violations, reflecting the city’s zero-tolerance approach to misconduct on public transport. With millions relying on the Metro daily, authorities say strict enforcement is essential to maintaining safety, efficiency and a world-class commuting experience.","Dubai’s ultra-modern Metro system is known for being fast, clean and efficient.

Meteor or space debris remains unclear

Growing volume of objects in Earth orbit

Differences in how light trails form





A bright streak of light briefly crossed the night sky above Wellington, New Zealand, on 30 January, catching the attention of residents and online viewers alike. The moment was captured by a fixed webcam at the Heretaunga Boating Club, where the light appeared reflected on the water below before fading from view. The footage circulated quickly after being shared online. According to reporting by the BBC, the source of the light has not been confirmed, though early assessments suggest it may have been a meteor or a piece of space debris re-entering Earth’s atmosphere. Events like this are not uncommon, but their suddenness and visibility often leave room for uncertainty, especially when they occur over populated areas and are recorded from multiple angles.The recording shows a sharp, luminous trail moving across the sky in a matter of seconds. It appears brighter than typical aircraft lights and lacks the blinking pattern usually associated with planes or helicopters. The reflection in the harbour adds to the impression of intensity, though the entire event is over almost as soon as it begins.Observers in and around Wellington reported seeing the light at roughly the same time.Some described it as a flash, others as a slow streak. No sound was reported, and there were no immediate reports of debris reaching the ground.The BBC noted that the light could have been caused by a meteor burning up as it entered the atmosphere. These natural objects are often no larger than a pebble, yet they can produce striking displays as friction heats them rapidly. Most disintegrate high above the Earth’s surface.Another possibility raised was space debris. In recent decades, the number of human-made objects in orbit has grown steadily. Old satellites, fragments from collisions, and discarded rocket parts sometimes fall back toward Earth, producing visual effects similar to meteors.According to the European Space Agency , more than sixty years of space activity have left a crowded orbital environment. Over 6,000 launches have placed tens of thousands of tracked objects into space. Of these, only a small proportion remain operational. The rest continue to circle the planet, gradually losing altitude.Together, this hardware represents thousands of tonnes of material. While most pieces burn up harmlessly on reentry, some survive longer than expected, depending on their size and composition.Meteors tend to move quickly and follow predictable paths based on their entry angle. Space debris, by contrast, can behave less consistently. Its shape, rotation, and material can all affect how it breaks apart, sometimes producing longer-lasting or uneven light trails.From the ground, these differences are not always easy to distinguish. A brief video clip, even a clear one, rarely provides enough information on its own.","A bright streak of light briefly crossed the night sky above Wellington, New Zealand, on 30 January.

Understanding paraselene: Russia observes rare ‘four moons’ spectacle



The science behind the eerie four-moon display







The city’s usual winter chill made eyes glued with folks whispering about the eerie glow, haunting yet almost surreal alignment of bright spots surrounding the real Moon. St. Petersburg, a city in Russia, viewed something unusual in the sky, which was reportedly addressed with ‘it wasn’t a glitch’ over social media platforms. A sky with ‘four Moons’ which viewers seemed lucky enough to look up and capture the moment with their phones.Sounds unreal, but it was a rare atmospheric phenomenon called a paraselene or ‘Mock Moon'.A paraselene, experts say, is caused by moonlight refracting through tiny ice crystals in the high cirrus clouds. The crystals are thin, plate-shaped, hexagonal, and floating far above the Earth. When the moonlight hits just right, it bends, creating bright spots on either side of the Moon. These are the “mock moons” or paraselenae.It seems like a simple trick of light, but it’s not. The angles have to be precise. NASA notes that these extra moons appear about 22 degrees or more away from the actual Moon. Usually, they are faint, especially compared to the bright lunar disk. So catching them requires good timing, clear skies, and a bit of luck.This particular display reportedly appeared because the ice crystals were wobbling slightly, giving the vertical extent of the paraselenae.Bigger crystals make taller mock moons. People watching the sky could see two on each side, creating the eerie impression of ‘four moons’ floating above the horizon.Photos showed ghostly images with the Moon at the centre and the two bright spots on either side, mirroring each other. “It looks like something out of a dream,” one observer reportedly wrote. Others commented that the sight was both beautiful and slightly unsettling. It’s the kind of rare occurrence that makes people stop in their tracks, even for a few moments.","St Petersburg, a city in Russia, viewed something unusual in the sky.

Medieval tunnels found inside 6000-year-old Neolithic site in Germany

A pit that did not behave like a grave

Erdstall tunnel points to medieval activity

Artefacts and animal remains inside the passage

Signs the tunnel entrance was deliberately sealed

Why a medieval tunnel was built inside a Neolithic grave site





Archaeologists in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt have uncovered an unusual underground tunnel inside a much older prehistoric burial site near the village of Reinstedt. The discovery was made during routine excavations carried out before the construction of wind turbines. The area was already known for its Neolithic and Bronze Age remains, but the tunnel came as an unexpected addition. At first, it appeared to be a simple pit in the soil. As digging continued, it became clear that the feature belonged to a much later period, likely the late Middle Ages. Its position inside an ancient burial landscape has drawn attention, raising quiet questions about how people in different eras reused places shaped long before their time. Mentioned in a press release Archaeologists working in Saxony-Anhalt have uncovered an unexpected underground structure inside a much older prehistoric burial site near the village of Reinstedt in the Harz district. The discovery was made during routine excavations carried out ahead of a planned wind energy project. What first appeared to be a simple feature in the soil slowly revealed something more complex, cutting across layers of history already known at the site.The location had long been recognised as archaeologically significant. A large trapezoid-shaped ditch from the Baalberg culture, dating to the fourth millennium BC, dominates the area. Nearby were traces of poorly preserved burials from the third millennium BC and remains that may belong to a Bronze Age burial mound dating to around the second millennium BC. The site had been used, reused, and reshaped over thousands of years.While examining the southern section of the Neolithic ditch, researchers noticed a long oval pit slicing across it at a near right angle. At first glance, it resembled a grave. But as excavation continued, the feature extended deeper into the loess soil without coming to an expected end. The fill contained late mediaeval pottery, loose stones, and small hollow spaces. The context no longer fit a burial.What emerged instead was an Erdstall, a narrow underground tunnel system dug by hand into firm soils. These structures are known from parts of central Europe and are usually dated to the late Middle Ages. Their purpose remains unclear. Some are thought to have served as hiding places, others as spaces with symbolic or ritual meaning.At Reinstedt, the tunnel curves gently toward the northwest. Inside, archaeologists found a horseshoe, the skeleton of a fox, and numerous bones from small animals. At the lowest level lay a thin layer of charcoal. The soil beneath showed no signs of prolonged heat, suggesting a short-lived fire rather than sustained use.The passage itself is cramped, barely a metre high in places and no wider than 70 centimetres. A stack of stones at the entrance may indicate it was deliberately sealed. A carved step and a small niche in the wall hint at careful planning rather than hurried digging.Why it was built here remains open. The prehistoric ditch may have still been visible in the medieval landscape, making the spot easy to locate. Or the ancient burial ground, possibly avoided by local people, may have offered the privacy needed for a hidden place. The tunnel keeps its silence.","Archaeologists in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt have uncovered an unusual underground tunnel inside a much older prehistoric burial site.

Kick reverses Nick Fuentes ’ partnership without explanation





Nicholas J. Fuentes, a prominent online streamer, revealed that his Kick Partnership Program approval was abruptly reversed just days after it was granted. Fuentes announced on X that his application for Kick’s partnership program was approved on Wednesday but, by the following Monday, Kick terminated his account from the program without giving any explanation. He claims to average 35,000–40,000 viewers per night, which would make him one of the top streamers on the platform. The sudden reversal has left Fuentes and his followers surprised and sparked discussions in streaming communities about Kick’s opaque and inconsistent partnership policies.The case brings to light the concerns regarding transparency in Kick’s partnership program. Many content creators have come forward about their accounts being suddenly restricted or denied/reverted without any reason or explanation from the platform. In Fuentes’ case, the sudden change occurs despite his high viewership, which is usually a prerequisite for inclusion in such programs. The uncertainty surrounding the reason for the decision has led to discussions on the platform’s treatment of its content creators.Fuentes shared the timeline of events publicly, his partnership was approved on Wednesday, and by Monday, February 2, 2026, it had been terminated.He posted the exact text of his announcement on X to highlight how quickly the reversal occurred. While Kick has not offered a public reason, this kind of sudden action is not unheard of on emerging streaming platforms that are still defining their policies. Many users and creators pointed out that such moves can be confusing for top-performing streamers and can affect trust in the platform.This controversy has also led to discussions on communication and moderation strategies employed by Kick. Streamers who depend on partnership benefits, such as monetization and support, are usually affected when sudden reversals happen. In this scenario, the communication of the events by Fuentes highlights how quickly things can change, even for a streamer with a massive following.In light of the above, the fact that Nick Fuentes was kicked out of Kick’s partnership program just days after approval is a clear indication of the challenges that content creators face on new streaming platforms. Although the platform has not given a reason for the ban, this is yet another case that has sparked debate on the issues of transparency, fairness, and treatment of content creators.","Nick Fuentes, a prominent online streamer, revealed that his Kick Partnership Program approval was abruptly reversed just days after it was granted.

Who built Jmail and what they were trying to prove

How the inbox changes the reading experience





Sifting through large document dumps is usually a tedious exercise, even when the material is of major public interest. That has been the case with emails linked to Jeffrey Epstein, which have circulated in the public domain as scanned PDFs, plain text files, and images released through court cases and official disclosures. A recent web project changes that experience entirely. Instead of forcing readers to jump between files, it presents the emails inside a familiar, Gmail-style interface, making the archive feel like a real inbox and turning a messy collection of documents into something far easier to explore, search, and understand.The project, known as Jmail, recreates the look and behaviour of Google’s email service while relying only on material that is already public. There is no new data and no private access involved. The aim is usability rather than revelation: to make existing records readable without specialist tools or hours of manual sorting.Jmail was created by Riley Walz, described by Wired as a prankster and internet artist, working alongside web developer Luke Igel. Rather than treating the Epstein emails as raw evidence to be mined for new revelations, the pair approached them as both a technical challenge and a cultural problem.Their central question was not what the emails contained, but how the way information is presented shapes who engages with it and who does not.The creators have framed Jmail as an experiment in accessibility. Public records, they argue, are often technically available but practically unusable, buried in fragmented files that discourage close reading. By rebuilding the archive in a familiar format, they sought to expose the gap between transparency in principle and transparency in practice.The interface mirrors the conventions of a standard email client. Messages are clearly divided between sent and received folders, conversations are grouped into threads, and a search bar allows users to look up names, dates, and keywords instantly. These small design decisions dramatically alter how the material can be navigated. Instead of skimming isolated documents, users can follow patterns of correspondence and timelines with minimal friction.For journalists and researchers, this reduces the time spent on basic organisation and increases the time available for analysis. For general readers, the familiar layout removes the intimidation factor that often accompanies large document dumps, making engagement more likely.Although the presentation can feel provocative, Jmail functions primarily as a research aid rather than a stunt.

The bottom line





For years, Elon Musk has said the same thing whenever his name surfaced in connection with Jeffrey Epstein . Epstein, Musk insisted, tried repeatedly to get him to visit his private Caribbean island. Musk refused. He never went.The latest tranche of Epstein emails released by the US Justice Department does not contradict the claim that Musk never visited the island. What it does complicate is the idea that he never wanted to.Between late 2012 and the end of 2013, Musk and Epstein exchanged multiple emails discussing island visits, parties, schedules, and logistics. Some plans fell through. Others were cancelled. But the emails show Musk actively engaging in conversations about going.Here is what the documents reveal.After the release of the latest tranche of Epstein files, Musk again pushed back publicly, saying the emails were being misread and selectively amplified. Posting on X, he claimed there were “a lot of fake emails flying around” and argued that his writing style made fabrications easy to identify. Responding to the suggestion that he was seeking to party with young women, Musk said that “if I actually wanted to spend my time partying with young women, it would be trivial for me to do so without the help of a creepy loser like Epstein… But I don’t,” reiterating that he never visited Epstein’s island and never flew on his jet.However, the older emails now in the public record show Musk repeatedly engaging Epstein about social plans and potential visits, including asking about the “wildest party” on the island and proposing specific dates to go, complicating the notion of an outright refusal.Epstein raises the possibility of flying Musk to the island by helicopter.“how many people will you be for the heli to island”“Probably just Talulah and me. What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?”This exchange shows Musk not only responding but asking about the timing of parties on the island.Musk says he wants to “let loose” after an exhausting year and is looking for parties rather than a quiet retreat.“Do you have any parties planned? I’ve been working to the edge of sanity this year and so, once my kids head home after Christmas, I really want to hit the party scene in St Barts or elsewhere and let loose. The invitation is much appreciated, but a peaceful island experience is the opposite of what I’m looking for,”“Understood , I will see you on st Barth, the ratio on my island might make Talilah uncomfortable,”“Ratio is not a problem for Talulah,”The conversation shifts from Epstein’s island to St Barts, but the island remains part of the discussion.After weeks of discussion, Musk backs out.“Logistics won’t work this time around.”No moral objection is cited. The reason given is logistical.Epstein’s assistant notes that Musk cannot attend a gathering at Epstein’s “Ranch” but agrees to a professional meeting instead.“Elon Musk appreciates the invitation to the Ranch but has commitments… Lunch on Monday Feb.25th at 1pm at Space X is confirmed”Epstein invites Musk to New York during the UN General Assembly, pitching it as a social gathering.“any plans for ny . the opening of the [general] assembly has many interesting people coming to the house”“I run and lead product design/engineering for two complicated companies. Moreover, SpaceX is about to launch what is arguably the most advanced rocket in history. Flying to NY to see UN diplomats do nothing would be an unwise use of time.”“Do you think i am re*****,”“Just kidding , there is no one over 25 and all very cute.”The reply would later draw scrutiny for both its language and implications.Musk says he will be in the Caribbean and asks directly about visiting.“Will be in the BVI/St Bart’s area over the holidays. Is there a good time to visit?”“any day 1st - 8th . play it by ear if you want. always space for you,”“I will come and get you,”Musk proposes visiting the island on January 2. Epstein ultimately cancels.“When should we head to your island on the 2nd?”“Bad news- Unfortunately , my schedule will keep me in New York . I was really looking forward to finally spending some time together with just fun as the agenda. so i am very disappointed. Hopefully we can schedule another time in the near future,”The emails do not show Elon Musk visiting Jeffrey Epstein’s island. They do not show him flying on Epstein’s plane or attending Epstein’s parties. What they do show is repeated engagement: questions about parties, discussions of timing, proposed dates, and an explicit plan to go that fell through only because Epstein was unavailable. They also show that Musk remained in touch with Epstein even after 2008, when Epstein was first convicted. The gap between Musk’s later public denials and the tone of these private emails is what has drawn renewed scrutiny — not what happened, but what was clearly considered.","The latest tranche of Epstein emails released by the US Justice Department does not contradict the claim that Musk never visited the island.

Abu Dhabi pet registration process



The Health Check: The vet will perform a medical examination to ensure the animal is healthy and up-to-date on its annual vaccinations.

The Microchip Requirement: A permanent microchip is mandatory. If your pet isn't chipped, the vet will install one, as the chip’s unique number is the primary key for the digital file.

TAMM Integration: The vet uploads the medical and microchip data directly to the government portal. Once uploaded, the owner will receive a notification to log into the TAMM app using their UAE Pass to confirm ownership and receive an official Animal Ownership Certificate.

Dh1,000 penalty

Why does your pet need a digital ID?





Starting February 3, 2026, owning a pet in Abu Dhabi officially comes with a new set of digital responsibilities.The Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT) has launched a mandatory pet registration system designed to bring every cat and dog into a secure, centralized database.By linking every pet to an owner via the TAMM platform, authorities can now provide better protection, monitor health trends, and manage the city's animal population with precision.The government has made the process as frictionless as possible to encourage early compliance. Registration is currently free of charge for all residents.To get started, pet owners must visit a licensed veterinary clinic in Abu Dhabi.While the law officially kicks in on February 3, the government is prioritizing education over immediate punishment.Individual pet owners are being granted a generous one-year grace period to complete the registration.However, this window is much smaller for businesses; pet shops, shelters, and commercial breeders must have all their animals registered within six months.Once these grace periods expire, the ""soft approach"" ends, failure to register a pet or keep its record updated will result in a Dh1,000 fine.This shift brings immediate practical benefits to the average resident. The most significant ""Common Impact"" is the recovery of lost pets. With a unified database, a lost dog found in a park can be scanned at any clinic, and the owner’s details will pop up instantly, ending the days of frantic social media searches.Additionally, the system ensures biosecurity; as Abu Dhabi opens more pet-friendly cafes, hotels, and parks, only registered and vaccinated pets will be allowed access, protecting both public health and your furry friend’s safety.","Abu Dhabi launches mandatory pet registration system on February 3, 2026.

Rain turns Sharjah roads into a backdrop for reckless stunts

Penalties reflect tough stance on road safety in Sharjah



Part of a broader safety push across the UAE



Community cooperation urged to preserve safety in Sharjah



Looking ahead: Road safety culture and enforcement in Sharjah







Sharjah Police have launched a decisive legal crackdown on motorists caught performing dangerous driving stunts during rainfall, seizing multiple vehicles and initiating action against eight drivers whose reckless behaviour risked lives on public roads. The incident, which went viral on social media as footage circulated of cars skidding and spinning on wet tarmac, underscores a growing focus by UAE law enforcement on combating reckless behaviour and enhancing road safety across the emirate.Last week, heavy rain in Sharjah brought a wave of unusual behaviour from some motorists who turned the slick roads into an impromptu playground for dangerous stunts. Sharjah Police, upon reviewing visual evidence and footage shared online, took action against eight drivers who were filmed pushing the limits of control in their vehicles, not only endangering their own lives but also threatening the safety of fellow road users.Authorities emphasised that such conduct is not a harmless thrill but a serious violation of federal traffic laws due to the inherently dangerous conditions rain creates, where reduced tire grip and increased stopping distances heighten the risk of loss of control and collisions. The Traffic and Patrols Directorate warned that what may start as a fun stunt can “turn moments of enjoyment into life-threatening scenarios,” especially when vehicles slide unpredictably on wet surfaces.Under the UAE’s Federal Traffic Law, the drivers apprehended face multiple penalties. For driving in a manner that endangers life and public safety, each offender will be fined AED 2,000 and receive 23 black points on their licence, along with vehicle impoundment of up to 60 days under Article 1(A). An additional offence, operating a vehicle on the road without licence plates, carries AED 3,000 in fines, an additional 23 black points and up to 90 days of impoundment under Article 4.Police noted that accumulating the yearly limit of 24 black points can lead to licence suspension and court proceedings, ensuring that repeated offenders may face even harsher consequences. This strong enforcement action reflects broader efforts to deter dangerous driving behaviour, particularly in challenging weather conditions when the margin for error is smaller and the potential cost in human life is higher.The Sharjah crackdown fits into a larger pattern of enforcement and public safety messaging across the UAE. In recent months, law enforcement agencies in other emirates have also taken firm action against reckless behaviour behind the wheel. For example, Dubai Police impounded a high-performance vehicle and took legal action after a driver posted clips of dangerous stunts online, highlighting risks posed by showboating on public streets.Similarly, Abu Dhabi Police arrested a driver livestreaming while weaving through traffic, emphasising that reaching for social media views should never come at the cost of road safety. These combined efforts echo steadfast guidance from traffic authorities that dangerous driving, whether fuelled by weather spectacle, social media or thrill-seeking, will not be tolerated.Sharjah’s current enforcement also reflects how authorities are applying existing traffic law provisions to changing behaviour patterns. According to a driving regulation guide issued by the Sharjah Police, violations such as driving dangerously or operating a vehicle without proper documentation attract significant fines, black points and vehicle confiscation periods, all designed to serve as strong deterrents.Police have not only punished the eight drivers but also appealed to the public to play an active role in monitoring and reporting unsafe driving practices. Members of the community were urged to report serious traffic violations immediately by dialling 999 for emergencies or 901 for non-emergency cases, reinforcing the idea that road safety is a shared responsibility between authorities and residents alike.The emphasis on such public participation reflects a broader traffic safety strategy in the UAE; one where enforcement, awareness and community vigilance work in tandem. Authorities contend that encouraging responsible driving habits is as important as penalising reckless conduct, especially during adverse conditions like rain, which already elevate risk levels.Weather-related road incidents, even when not involving stunts, are known to heighten risk. Rain reduces tire traction, increases braking distances and can dramatically change a vehicle’s handling characteristics. While many drivers adapt to these conditions with caution, others misjudge their vehicle’s capabilities or overestimate their own skills. What might appear to be fun (such as spinning tires or drifting on wet roads) can quickly turn into serious crashes with injuries or fatalities.Traffic authorities have repeatedly stressed that rain is not an invitation to test driving limits but a time for heightened caution. In wet conditions, even routine manoeuvres require slower speeds, longer following distances and mindful steering, lessons often reinforced by accident statistics and public safety campaigns.While the legal action against the eight drivers has made headlines, it also serves as a cautionary tale for drivers across the UAE. As authorities step up enforcement and penalties remain stringent, motorists are reminded that public roadways are shared spaces where individual choices can have far-reaching consequences.Reckless behaviour of whether performing stunts, livestreaming while driving or ignoring hazardous conditions, does not only risk fines and impoundment. It can lead to serious injuries, loss of life and long-term legal consequences such as licence suspension and court appearances. Sharjah Police’s message is clear: enjoying weather and scenic conditions should never come at the cost of safety. The emirate’s legal action underscores a firm commitment to preserving lives, reducing road accidents and fostering a culture of responsible driving that protects all road users.","Sharjah Police have launched a legal crackdown on motorists caught performing dangerous driving stunts during rainfall.

By extending the sales window well beyond the end of Ramadan and through Eid Al-Fitr , the ministry aims to reduce last-minute congestion in markets and allow households to plan their purchases in a more relaxed manner.The Ramadan sales season covers a wide range of products linked to the holy month and the subsequent Eid celebrations. This includes all Ramadan-related goods as well as Eid necessities, ensuring that consumers can access discounts across essential categories throughout the period, rather than being limited to a short festive window.Also Read: Ramadan 2026: Expected dates, fasting hours, and seasonal shifts explained To support businesses, the Ministry of Commerce has invited retail establishments and online stores to participate by applying for discount permits electronically through the official platform sales.mc.gov.sa.The ministry clarified that taking part in the Ramadan sales season will not deduct from an establishment’s annual discount balance. This means businesses can obtain, print, and display official permits without losing any of their allocated discount days for the year, making participation simpler and more flexible.Consumer transparency is a key part of the initiative. Shoppers can verify the authenticity of discounts by scanning the barcode displayed on the official permit using their mobile phone camera. Once scanned, the system provides complete information about the offer, including the type and percentage of the discount, its duration, and basic details of the establishment offering it.The ministry also confirmed that inspection teams will conduct field tours across all regions of the Kingdom throughout the sales season. These inspections are aimed at monitoring compliance, verifying the legitimacy of promotional offers, and ensuring that advertised discounts match the information approved under the official permits.","The Ramadan sales season will run for 54 days, starting on February 1 and continuing until March 26, 2026.

How UAE Residents Are Outsourcing Their Thinking to AI Chatbots And What It Says About the Future

The psychology of outsourcing thought to AI







In the United Arab Emirates, artificial intelligence is no longer a niche technology used only by tech companies. It is becoming an integral part of how people think, shop, work, plan and even solve day-to-day problems. As AI adoption accelerates, many residents are turning to chatbots and generative AI assistants not just for simple queries, but for complex decision-making, creativity and personalised support.Reports and surveys show that AI use in the UAE is among the highest in the world, with generative AI tools integrated into work, study and personal life. A 2025 study found that nearly two-thirds of working-age adults actively use AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini or Claude in their routines , placing the UAE at the forefront of global AI adoption.One of the most striking trends is how many UAE residents now use AI assistants to guide their research, choices and day-to-day tasks. For example, a recent retail report found that 70% of UAE consumers have used AI assistants for shopping, whether for product discovery, comparison or personalised recommendations, more than double the average rate in Europe, the Middle East and Africa region.This shift reflects a broader pattern with information overload, busy lifestyles and instant expectations, consumers increasingly prefer to offload cognitive tasks to AI, letting algorithms sift through data, suggest options and even make choices they might previously have wrestled with themselves.In essence, many users are beginning to see chatbots not just as tools for answers but as thinking partners that can help them organise trips, manage errands, generate ideas or draft content, effectively outsourcing parts of their cognitive load to AI systems.The influence of AI extends well beyond shopping. Microsoft-backed reports have highlighted that the UAE workforce has one of the highest AI adoption rates globally, with nearly 60% of workers regularly using AI tools like Copilot, ChatGPT and others in professional tasks such as drafting emails, preparing reports, analysing data and even automating routine responsibilities.Likewise, LinkedIn data shows that 80% of UAE professionals are using AI tools regularly, up sharply from the previous year, often treating AI as a sort of second job assistant that enhances productivity and extends creative capabilities. This widespread integration has turned AI chatbots into more than mere utilities. For many, they are cognitive extensions that help process information, generate ideas and complete complex tasks faster than humans alone could.AI chatbots have also found a place in public life and government services across the UAE. Platforms like Rammas, an AI assistant from Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, have answered millions of resident queries, helping people manage their utility accounts, understand bills and navigate service issues.Similarly, industry-specific chatbots such as mortgage chat assistants launched during Dubai AI Week, are helping residents make significant financial decisions by comparing real-time mortgage options and documentation requirements through conversational interfaces. These tools showcase how chatbots are transitioning from ad-hoc helpers to core components of a smart, digital lifestyle where technical expertise, bureaucratic navigation and personal decision-making can all be mediated by AI.The UAE’s national AI strategy and initiatives like ChatGPT Plus access for residents, though not fully free yet but part of broader talks under the Stargate UAE initiative, reflect government ambitions to embed AI more deeply in everyday life. These efforts aim to empower individuals and businesses alike with advanced AI tools as part of the country’s vision to become a global AI hub by 2031.By expanding access and literacy around AI, the policy push encourages residents to incorporate chatbots not just for simple queries but as trusted aides in research, planning, education and even creative work.While residents are enthusiastic about AI’s convenience, using bots to cut through online noise, get fast insights and automate routine tasks, there are also questions about trust and limitations. For example, surveys show that while many UAE consumers enjoy interacting with AI for basic support, a majority still prefer human contact for complex or sensitive issues such as customer disputes or trouble-shooting technical problems.This trust gap underscores a central tension in the AI adoption story: people like the speed and accessibility of chatbots but often hesitate to fully delegate important decisions or nuanced problem-solving to machines.Beyond practical tasks, research from behavioural studies suggests that heavy reliance on AI chatbots can shape how people approach decisions, relationships and social interaction. Longer and more intense AI use has been correlated with increased feelings of dependence and in some cases, reduced social engagement, highlighting psychological nuances in human-AI relationships that go well beyond utility.Though these findings are global and not UAE-specific, they point to broader implications of a society where AI is deeply woven into daily life, especially in a place like the UAE, where adoption rates are among the highest in the world. Outsourcing thinking to AI is not just about convenience, it suggests a shift in cognitive culture. Residents increasingly expect AI to anticipate their needs, synthesise vast amounts of information and help them make choices quickly and confidently.In workplaces, homes and government services, chatbots are becoming collaborators in thought processes rather than mere assistants. This transformation reflects both the UAE’s technological ambition and a global trend toward human-AI collaboration that will likely define the coming decade, with profound effects on how people learn, decide, interact and live.","In the United Arab Emirates, artificial intelligence is no longer a niche technology used only by tech companies.

Dubai new rules for parking shades: What residents must know before installing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-new-rules-for-parking-shades-what-residents-must-know-before-installing/articleshow/127778547.cms,"Dubai RTA Issues New Rules for Residential Parking Shades / Image: file

Dubai RTA’s new rule

Only the owner of the villa or a legally authorized representative can submit the request through the RTA website or ""Dubai Drive"" app.



You must provide a site plan showing the exact location. The shade cannot interfere with utility lines (DEWA), telecommunications, or existing trees.



The RTA strictly forbids the use of ""makeshift"" materials. Forget about using old fabric or wooden planks; the structure must be made of high-quality, weather-resistant materials that match the architectural aesthetic of the neighborhood.

Limits you need to know





As the Dubai summer approaches, every resident knows the struggle of entering a car that has been sitting in 45-degree heat. While installing a parking shade seems like a simple DIY project or a quick call to a contractor, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has issued a firm reminder that the streets and pavements outside your villa are public property.To maintain the organized beauty of Dubai’s residential communities and ensure that emergency vehicles aren't blocked, the RTA has streamlined the rules for who can build these structures and exactly how they must look.Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has rolled out a formal permit system that allows residents to install parking shade structures in residential neighbourhoods, with conditions. This move comes after listening to community feedback, especially as summer heat rises and cars parked in direct sun become a daily concern for homeowners.The new “Parking Shade Installation Permit” applies only to designated and properly reserved parking spaces in residential areas, meaning you can’t just erect shades anywhere on the street. Permits are applied for through the RTA website and processed via approved contractors.This isn’t just a token gesture, it’s a regulated system designed to be safe, orderly, and visually consistent across Dubai’s neighbourhoods. According to the RTA:The RTA is very specific about where these shades can go to prevent them from becoming a hazard.One of the most critical rules is the ""Pedestrian Path"" requirement. You must ensure that the shade does not obstruct the sidewalk; a minimum clearance must be left so that people, including those in wheelchairs or with strollers, can pass through safely.Furthermore, the height of the shade must be sufficient to allow standard SUVs and service vehicles to park underneath without clipping the roof, but it must not be so high that it blocks the line of sight for drivers turning at nearby corners.For the average resident, following these rules isn't just about avoiding a fine, though those can be steep. It’s about ""Common Impact"", ensuring that your convenience doesn't become your neighbor's headache.

"UAE banks introduce digital verification, phase out handwritten signatures",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-banks-introduce-digital-verification-phase-out-handwritten-signatures/articleshow/127767491.cms,"Your phone is now your signature as UAE banks go paperless

UAE bank's new digital leap

Biometrics and in-app approvals

What does this mean for customers?

Faster, paperless banking - no more branch visits for approvals.



More secure authentication - moving beyond SMS codes to identity tied directly to the user and device.



Greater reliance on mobile banking apps - your phone becomes the hub of authorisation and identity.



Preparation required - update banking apps, enable push notifications, and activate biometric login features to avoid disruptions.







For decades, a handwritten signature was the gold standard of trust in banking, but in the UAE, the ink is finally running dry. Banks across the country have begun a coordinated phase-out of traditional signatures for retail and corporate transactions.This shift means that the days of meticulously signing checkbooks or loan applications with a pen are being replaced by a ""digital handshake.""Leading financial institutions, in alignment with the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE), are moving toward a 100% paperless verification model. This transition isn't just about modernizing, it’s about eliminating the human error and forgery risks that have long plagued handwritten verifications.Another landmark change is the elimination of SMS-based one-time passwords (OTPs), a familiar security tool used for years to approve online transactions. UAE banks officially stopped sending OTP codes by SMS for online card payments from January 6, 2026, and all banks are required to phase out both SMS and email OTPs by March 2026 at the latest, under Central Bank directives.Instead of relying on codes sent through carrier networks, which are vulnerable to fraud tactics like SIM swapping and interception, customers must now authorise transactions directly through their bank’s mobile app.This shift is designed to tighten cybersecurity, speed up approvals, and eliminate the weakest link in digital banking authentication.Banks have been notifying customers in advance, urging them to update apps, enable notifications, and set up in-app authentication features (including biometrics) to ensure a seamless experience. Without app-based verification enabled, online payments could be declined once SMS codes are turned off.The replacement for SMS OTPs isn’t just another password or code, it’s in-app approvals backed by biometrics. Most UAE banks now let customers confirm transactions right inside their mobile banking app with fingerprint scans, facial recognition, or secure app-based PINs.This method is more secure because it operates entirely within the app’s encrypted environment, rather than over open telecom networks. It also simplifies the user experience: instead of reading a text message and typing a code, users receive a prompt in the app and confirm the payment with a tap and biometric check.Experts note that while this is a big security upgrade, it brings new risks that banks and customers must address, such as malware, phishing attempts targeting banking apps, and ensuring devices remain secure. Nevertheless, the shift represents global best practices in digital security and aligns the UAE with advanced authentication trends worldwide.For everyday UAE residents, these changes mean:Beyond banking, this shift is part of the UAE’s broader push toward a fully digital financial ecosystem, including initiatives like digital KYC platforms and pilot projects for biometric payments using facial and palm recognition. These moves help position the UAE as a global leader in secure, innovative financial technology.In short, the era of ink signatures and SMS passwords is ending. In its place is a digital-first, biometric-enabled banking experience that promises stronger protection and smoother daily interactions for everyone who banks in the UAE.","Banks across the country have begun a coordinated phase-out of traditional signatures for retail and corporate transactions.

UK households urged to stockpile three essentials ahead of Storm Chandra power cut risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-households-urged-to-stockpile-three-essentials-ahead-of-storm-chandra-power-cut-risk/articleshow/127574703.cms,"UK households are urged to prepare torches, spare batteries and phone chargers ahead of potential power cuts/ Image: Pexels

“

Storm Chandra

will bring persistent rain, heavy at times, later Monday and overnight before steadily clearing northeastwards on Tuesday morning. 30–50mm rainfall is likely widely, with 60–80mm across some higher ground, especially south Dartmoor. Falling on saturated ground, this is likely to lead to flooding and disruption, particularly on Tuesday morning. Strong southeasterly winds are also expected.”

“Whilst accumulating snow is unlikely at low-levels, there will be a sharp increase in snow depths with elevation, with the potential for 2–5cm in places above about 300m, 5–10cm above 400m, and 10–20cm above 500m. This may impact some high-level routes, with drifting possible in rather brisk southeasterly winds. Strong, gusty winds, especially to the west of hills, may exacerbate the potential for transport disruption.”

“Storm Chandra will bring a range of hazards to the UK through Monday night and Tuesday. Initially strong winds will impact the Isles of Scilly, western Cornwall and southwest Wales which are still vulnerable after Storm Goretti, gusts of 70 to 80mph are possible here. Heavy rain is an additional hazard as it falls on saturated ground in Dorset and southern parts of Devon, Somerset and Cornwall.

As Chandra interacts with colder air further north snow becomes a hazard, with 10–20cm of snow possibly accumulating over higher ground in the Pennines, southern Scotland and the Highlands. With a complex spell of weather, it’s important people stay up to date with the forecast and any warnings in your area.”

The three items households are urged to have ready

First, a torch. British Gas recommends a battery-powered or wind-up (kinetic) torch to ensure light is available if electricity supplies are interrupted.

Second, spare batteries. Households are advised to stock up on appropriate batteries. such as AA or AAA, for torches and other essential devices.

Third, a backup charger for mobile phones. A portable battery pack with a charging cable can help people stay connected and access updates during an outage.

“You might even consider a battery-powered radio, to keep on top of local updates if you can’t use your mobile.”





The Met Office has issued a series of weather warnings covering snow, rain and wind from late Monday through Tuesday. These include a 17-hour yellow warning for rain and snow from midnight Tuesday until 5pm, an amber warning for wind in eastern Northern Ireland, and an amber warning for rain across parts of south-west England.Explaining the risk in the south of England, the Met Office said:In northern England and Scotland, snow rather than rain is the main concern. The Met Office warned:In a broader briefing on the storm, the Met Office said Storm Chandra will bring “a further spell of wet and windy conditions later Monday and into Tuesday”, with gusty winds initially affecting the Isles of Scilly, western Cornwall and south-west Wales before moving north through the Irish Sea.An amber warning for wind has been issued for eastern Northern Ireland, where gusts of 60–70mph are expected widely, with up to 75mph possible in coastal areas. Heavy rain falling on already saturated ground in south Devon, Dorset, southern Somerset and south-east Cornwall could lead to flooding, while colder air further north will turn precipitation into hill snow across northern England and Scotland.Met Office Chief Forecaster Paul Gundersen said:With the risk of power cuts rising during periods of severe weather, energy firm British Gas has urged households to make sure they have three key items readily available.British Gas added:While additional supplies such as non-perishable food and blankets can be useful, the focus of the advice is on lighting, communication and access to information during potential power disruptions as Storm Chandra moves across the UK.","UK households urged to prepare torches, spare batteries and phone chargers ahead of potential power cuts.

Samuel was sent this picture as claimed proof of delivery, though he pointed out the phone should have been signed for (Kennedy News and Media)





A delivery driver has been removed after home security footage appeared to show him faking the delivery of a £1,200 iPhone and driving away with the parcel instead.Samuel Taylor, 20, from Rochdale, ordered a £1,264 iPhone 17 Pro Max through Giffgaff, with delivery handled by DPD. On 19 January, Taylor received a photo notification claiming the parcel had been posted through his letterbox. When he returned home from work, the phone was nowhere to be found. His father confirmed no delivery had taken place.Footage from the family’s security camera showed a courier pulling up outside the house, selecting a parcel from his van and approaching the front door. Moments later, the driver appeared to walk back to the vehicle still holding the same package before driving off.“I was shocked,” Taylor said. “When I got home my dad said it wasn’t actually there. We checked the cameras and saw what happened. I was just really annoyed and I feel robbed.”Taylor contacted DPD to complain but said he was initially told the phone had been delivered and advised to raise the issue with Giffgaff. Instead, he reported the incident to Greater Manchester Police and posted the footage on social media in an effort to force the company to respond.“Since DPD are not interested in their driver not delivering my £1,200 iPhone I thought I’d shame them on here,” he wrote.Reviewing the footage later, Taylor said it became clear the driver appeared unaware he was being recorded, ruling out the possibility of an administrative mix-up or a delayed return to the depot.“I don’t think he noticed the cameras,” Taylor said. “I thought it might’ve gone back to the warehouse, but we got in touch with DPD and they said it hadn’t been signed back in.DPD later confirmed that the driver had been “removed from the business” following an internal investigation. A spokesperson said: “We have carried out a thorough investigation and can confirm that the driver has been removed from the business. We have a zero-tolerance approach to incidents such as this and will always take firm action. We apologise whole-heartedly to Mr Taylor and have informed Giffgaff.”Giffgaff said the proof of delivery did not meet its standards and confirmed Taylor’s deposit had been refunded while the case is reviewed. “We’re sorry to hear that Samuel did not receive his new iPhone as intended,” a spokesperson said.Taylor said he still has not received the phone and no longer trusts the courier. “With something that expensive it has to be signed for anyway,” he said. “I just want the phone I paid for.”","Samuel Taylor, 20, from Rochdale, ordered a £1,264 iPhone 17 Pro Max through Giffgaff, with delivery handled by DPD.

Why hundreds of bald eagles are flocking to northern British Columbia’s frozen mountains during winter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/why-hundreds-of-bald-eagles-are-flocking-to-northern-british-columbias-frozen-mountains-during-winter/articleshow/126672217.cms,"Source: X

Why British Columbia’s winter landscapes draw bald eagles together



Bald eagles and rare winter group behaviour



What winter eagle gatherings reveal to scientists







In the frozen mountains of northern British Columbia, there was the unusual occurrence of a rare incident in the wildlife scene where the bald eagles were gathered in their hundreds in one spot, and in the middle of winter. Against the background of mountains laden with snow and the icy river valley, the sight was quite outstanding and unusual. For bald eagles, which stand out in their status as symbols of freedom, power, and dominance in nature, it was highly unusual for them to congregate in such huge numbers because they were predominantly lone animals and territorial in their behaviour patterns. The severity of the weather seemed to have had a huge effect on the eagles, as only limited spaces were available and where their feeds were still accessible, forcing unprecedented gatherings that stunned researchers and local communities alike. Such rare congregations offer scientists valuable insight into how climate stress reshapes wildlife behaviour and survival strategies.The northern area of British Columbia is important to the wintering survival of bald eagles. Though much of this area will freeze, there will always be fast-moving rivers that are partially open, providing the eagles with readily available fish. Rivers that support salmon are usually connected, forming pathways to life-sustaining riverways.As winter approaches and the temperature cools, bald eagles from an increasingly vast area will migrate to these feeding grounds, and many will be seen in one small area.The harsh environment imposed by winter causes a shift in bald eagles' normal habits. The immobility brought by snow, the uninhabitability of lakes due to ice, and the shorter daylight hours make energy conservation essential. The habit of securing territories disappears, with eagles seeking locations close to food sources. The movement of prey through the snow-covered environment is predictable, helping the eagles modify their hunting patterns. What seems like a rare concentration of birds is, in actual fact, a decision based on survival that is influenced by the environment.In areas outside breeding colonies or feeding grounds, however, bald eagles tend to be alone. Adults do not compete with each other, particularly around feeding areas. To witness so many of them assemble at one place is a clear indication that their social norms have been temporarily overlooked. Experts say that it is possible only in areas where food is plentiful and accessible. In such areas, even though competition may be a disadvantage, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to observe their flexibility in handling their socialisation.The group behaviours exhibited during winter are very advantageous in several ways. The eagles can view each other in search of food, thus saving time looking for it in the frozen land. Additionally, the dominant eagles will either jump over the ice or find a source of food first as an indirect means of providing for the rest of the group members. The younger and weaker eagles are able to get protection by staying in a group, thus minimising the chances of starvation.Large winter gatherings offer a unique opportunity to study bald eagles under environmental stress. Scientists are able to estimate population size, age structure, feeding patterns, and social tolerance. It helps them to get an idea about the resiliency of the species towards extreme weather and habitat pressure. This kind of data is very crucial in view of changing climatic cycles that disturb food availability and migration behaviour in an ecosystem.The sight of hundreds of eagles in one place often plays the role of a sign of ecological vigour: healthy fish populations, undisrupted waterways, and preserved forest habitats. These aggregations are the natural barometers by which environmental health is spotlighted, emphasising those areas where ecosystems are healthy and working. Such observations also guide conservation planning, policy decisions, habitat restoration priorities, and long-term monitoring strategies across regions facing climate variability.","The sight of hundreds of bald eagles in one place is a sign of ecological vigour.

Kennedy Memorial Center For The Performing Arts, in Washington. (AP/PTI)(AP01_30_2026_000001A)

Woman Caught Defacing ‘Melania’ Poster as LA Bus Vandalism Explodes | WATCH





For a film that arrived wrapped in online mockery and political memes, Melania has managed an outcome few documentaries achieve: a strong theatrical debut.The Amazon-backed documentary centred on First Lady Melania Trump is projected to earn around $8 million in its opening weekend in the US and Canada, marking the strongest opening for a non-concert documentary in over a decade. The figure is significantly higher than early projections and places the film well ahead of typical releases in the genre.The performance stands in sharp contrast to the film’s digital reception. On social media, Melania has been widely derided as a glossy vanity project, with critics dismissing it as stage-managed and self-promotional. Viral jokes and conspiracy-tinged commentary framed the film as emblematic of Trump-era excess. Yet the theatre turnout tells a different story.Audience data indicates that the film has over-performed in rural and Republican-leaning regions, with states such as Florida, Texas and Arizona driving ticket sales. Nearly half of the opening weekend audience reportedly came from smaller towns and non-urban markets, an unusually high share for a documentary.The demographic profile has been equally distinctive. Viewers were overwhelmingly female and over the age of 55, with many screenings attracting organised groups from conservative and senior citizen communities.For much of this audience, the film appears to function less as a cinematic event and more as a cultural affirmation.That divide between online commentary and offline consumption has defined Melania’s release. While critics and commentators debated its intent and tone, ticket buyers showed up with clear expectations and, in many cases, left satisfied. Exit surveys reflected strong audience approval, even as professional reviews remained largely sceptical.The scale of Amazon’s investment ensures that the box office numbers, though impressive for a documentary, come with qualifications. The company is reported to have spent tens of millions acquiring and marketing the film, making it one of the most expensive documentaries ever produced. Theatrical revenues alone are unlikely to offset that outlay, placing greater emphasis on the film’s eventual performance on streaming.Critical reception has focused on the film’s polished presentation and limited introspection, with reviewers arguing that its tightly controlled narrative leaves little room for complexity. The choice of director has also drawn attention, given his long absence from filmmaking before this project.Yet none of that appears to have deterred its core audience. In several screenings, viewers described their ticket purchase as a statement, reflecting a broader pattern in American culture where media consumption has become a marker of political identity as much as entertainment preference.Historically, documentaries struggle to draw sustained theatrical crowds. Few cross even modest box office thresholds. Against that backdrop, Melania’s opening weekend stands out, regardless of how the film is judged critically.The broader takeaway is familiar. In a polarised media environment, online ridicule does not necessarily translate into commercial failure. Cultural products no longer require universal approval. They require an audience that feels invested enough to turn up.For Melania, that audience did.",The Amazon-backed documentary centred on First Lady Melania Trump is projected to earn around $8 million in its opening weekend.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.
