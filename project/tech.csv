THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala govt is set to introduce the Kerala Prohibition of Ragging (Amendment) Bill, 2025, overhauling its two-decade-old anti-ragging legislation. This move comes in the wake of the death of J S Siddharthan — a student of Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Pookode, Wayanad, at his hostel last February — which highlighted critical loopholes in the existing 1998 Act.For the first time, the revised bill explicitly defines ragging to include body shaming, psychological harassment, and digital abuse, making them punishable under law. Harassment through internet or any other electronic mode will now be a cognisable offence. The amendment broadens scope of ragging to encompass a wide array of criminal acts, such as abetment, criminal conspiracy, unlawful assembly, and rioting.","Kerala govt is set to introduce the Kerala Prohibition of Ragging (Amendment) Bill, 2025, overhauling its two-decade-old anti-ragging legislation.

Dave Portnoy to appear on Big Noon Kickoff with Fox Sports this fall

Dave Barstool to launch new daily show on FS1 as part of deal

A big deal is coming to sports TV. On July 15, 2025, Fox Sports announced a new partnership with Dave Portnoy and Barstool Sports. This agreement will bring Barstool content to Fox’s college football programming and other network shows. The deal is being called “wide-ranging” and marks a major moment for both Fox and Barstool. The move comes just ahead of the 2025 college football season and will officially begin this fall. While full details have not been shared, Fox confirmed that Portnoy will be part of their popular Big Noon Kickoff show.Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports, will now be seen weekly on Big Noon Kickoff, one of Fox’s most-watched college football pregame shows. Portnoy is known for his strong opinions, unfiltered takes, and huge fan base. His addition is expected to bring younger viewers to Fox and spark more online discussion around the show.This isn’t Portnoy’s first time on television. In 2017, he had a brief deal with ESPN for a late-night show, but it ended quickly due to controversy. Now, in 2025, Portnoy is returning to network TV with a much bigger platform. He will appear on the pregame desk alongside Rob Stone, Matt Leinart, Urban Meyer, Brady Quinn, and Mark Ingram.His love for college football, especially his longtime support of the Michigan Wolverines, makes him a natural fit. Fox believes his influence will help them compete directly with ESPN’s College GameDay, especially after ESPN added Pat McAfee, another former Barstool personality.The deal doesn’t end with football. As part of the agreement, Fox Sports will also launch a new two-hour morning show on FS1 featuring Barstool talent. This show will be produced at Barstool’s Chicago studio. While the lineup hasn’t been officially announced, fans expect to see familiar Barstool faces like Dan “Big Cat” Katz and others.Also Read: Joy Taylor’s Sudden Fox Sports Firing Sparks Outrage After Canceling ‘Speak’ With Paul Pierce And Keyshawn Johnson Fox recently made room in its lineup after canceling The Carton Show and The Herd, so this timing fits.

A married tech CEO who went viral after being caught on the kiss cam with a colleague at a Coldplay concert is being slammed by a former employee as a “toxic” boss, with ex-staffers reportedly having second-hand embarrassment.Andy Byron is the chief executive of New York-based software firm Astronomer. He was seen in an awkward position with the company’s chief human resources officer Kristin Cabot during the band’s Boston show at Gillette Stadium.The pair was shown holding hands and wrapped in each other’s arms on the big screen before Cabot turned her back to the camera and Byron tried to duck out of view.The viral clip sparked online debate over workplace conduct and also started chatter among Byron’s former employees.A former employee who once reported directly to Byron told the New York Post that the incident was met with laughter and a sense of satisfaction among former staff.“The text groups and chains of former employees are like… everybody’s laughing their ass off and enjoying the hell out of what happened and him getting exposed,” the former colleague told The Post.The source added that Byron was seen as a harsh and aggressive manager.“In the workplace, Byron allegedly has a reputation as an aggressive, sales-obsessed executive who can be ‘toxic’,” the former employee said.Astronomer has not yet issued a public statement on the incident. Byron and Cabot have also not responded to media requests for comment.Astronomer, known for building cloud platforms to manage and monitor data pipelines, hired Cabot in November 2024. At the time, Byron had publicly praised her, saying, “Kristin’s exceptional leadership and deep expertise in talent management, employee engagement, and scaling people strategies will be critical as we continue our rapid trajectory.”“She is a proven leader at multiple growth-stage companies and her passion for fostering diverse, collaborative workplaces makes her a perfect fit for Astronomer,” he added in the company’s official press release. Cabot had previously worked at data analytics firm Neo4j.She had responded positively to her onboarding experience, saying she was “energized” by her conversations with Byron and the Astronomer leadership team.Now, the viral concert video has proven damaging not just for the CEO and the HR head, but also for the company’s public image. Social media users criticised Astronomer’s work culture, with many demanding disciplinary action and suggesting that the leadership was aware of the relationship.Adding to the speculation, another employee from Astronomer who attended the concert with the pair was also seen in the video, appearing shocked and smiling as Cabot covered her face and Byron retreated from the camera’s view.",Andy Byron is the chief executive of New York-based software firm Astronomer.

A restaurant in northern China has sparked outrage after offering customers the chance to cuddle lion cubs while enjoying afternoon tea.Animal welfare groups and social media users are slamming the experience as exploitative and dangerous.The Wanhui restaurant is situated in Taiyuan City in Shanxi province. It allows guests to handle the young lions as part of a four-course tea set, priced at 1,078 yuan ($150). Since opening in June, the venue has been selling around 20 tickets daily for the experience, which also features other animals such as llamas, deer, and turtles. Videos and photos of customers cradling the lion cubs have gone viral on Chinese social media platforms like WeChat and Weibo.Animal rights advocates have condemned the practice, warning of both ethical and safety concerns. “Tearing lion cubs from their mothers so diners can handle them over afternoon tea is exploitation, not entertainment. These animals are living, feeling beings, not toys,” Jason Baker, Senior vice president at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), told news agency Reuters.Baker also criticised the trend of using animals for viral content, adding, “The animals were treated like nothing more than social media props.”Peter Li, a policy expert on China for Humane World for Animals, also raised concerns about the risks involved. “Exploiting wild animals for selfies and marketing gimmicks is not only appallingly bad animal welfare, it's also potentially risky for customers,” he was quoted as saying to Reuters. “Even a young lion is capable of lashing out and injuring a human. So, treating wild animals like props is both morally unacceptable and dangerously irresponsible. ”Despite the backlash, the restaurant has defended itself, claiming the cubs are in good health and under professional care. “They were taken care of very well, with specialised carers to tend to them,” a representative told Reuters.This incident follows another controversial hospitality service in China last month, when authorities launched an investigation into a hotel in Chongqing for its so-called “wake-up service” using red pandas. The animals were allowed to climb onto guests’ beds to rouse them in the mornings, drawing similar criticism from animal rights groups.",The Wanhui restaurant is situated in Taiyuan City in Shanxi province.

No Formalities, Sheikh Mansour Played the Game



A Broader Pattern in UAE Leadership







In the UAE, where extreme summer heat often limits outdoor activity, the response has been practical and purpose-driven. Initiatives like Abu Dhabi Summer Sports (ADSS) are turning indoor spaces into large-scale, accessible venues for sport and wellbeing. It’s part of a wider national effort, led by figures known for their visible, hands-on approach, to keep the country active, engaged, and connected year-round.That approach was clearly on display during a recent visit to the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC), where the event is being held. His Highness Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Vice President of the UAE, Deputy Prime Minister, and Chairman of the Presidential Court, attended in an active capacity, engaging with organisers, reviewing the venue's facilities, and joining participants in a casual volleyball match.The Abu Dhabi Summer Sports (ADSS) event is a large-scale indoor initiative aimed at encouraging people of all ages to stay active, fit, and healthy throughout the UAE’s hottest months. Organised by the ADNEC Group in partnership with the Abu Dhabi Sports Council, the event brings together a wide range of sports and activities under one roof in a safe, climate-controlled environment.ADSS is built with both scale and purpose. Hosted at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC), the venue spans more than 37,000 square metres, making it one of the largest indoor sports activations in the region. Its infrastructure includes:t one of the largest indoor sports activations in the region. Its infrastructure includes:What makes the event stand out isn’t just the size but how it’s designed to serve everyone, not just trained athletes or sports clubs.Families, children, casual fitness lovers, and amateurs all have dedicated zones. From kid-friendly setups to structured games parents can join, the environment is curated to encourage shared experiences and long-term engagement in physical wellness.Sheikh Mansour was briefed by organisers on all aspects of the event: the design logic, activity zones, safety measures, and objectives behind the initiative. That includes the strategic aim of sustaining community-wide physical activity during a season where most people typically avoid it.What set this visit apart was not the speeches or the staging, it was the simplicity of it. After his tour, Sheikh Mansour joined a friendly volleyball match, playing alongside everyday participants. No grand announcement, no tightly choreographed ceremony, just a real game, in real time, among the people.This direct involvement aligned with the broader goals of the Abu Dhabi Summer Sports (ADSS) initiative: encouraging people across age groups and skill levels to take part in regular physical activity, even during the peak of summer.Following the visit, Sheikh Mansour commended the overall organisation, noting the event’s accessibility, safety standards, and capacity to host a wide variety of sports. He highlighted its value in promoting community health, supporting active lifestyles, and providing well-equipped, climate-controlled spaces for year-round sport.Sheikh Mansour’s participation fits into a larger national narrative, one where sport and wellness are not just government-supported, but culturally encouraged. Leaders across the Emirates frequently show up at local sports events, and many of them are athletes themselves.A notable example of leadership-driven fitness culture is Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, widely known as Fazza. He is an accomplished endurance rider with numerous international titles and pursues activities like skydiving, scuba diving, and flyboarding. Through his active presence on Instagram, Sheikh Hamdan makes fitness a visible, aspirational part of leadership, inspiring younger generations to embrace an active lifestyle.","Abu Dhabi Summer Sports is a large-scale, climate-controlled event promoting fitness for all ages through over 12 sports and family activities.

"Speed trap backlash: Brampton’s roads flooded with 185 surveillance cameras; drivers say ‘we’re human, not machines’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/speed-trap-backlash-bramptons-roads-flooded-with-185-surveillance-cameras-drivers-say-were-human-not-machines/articleshow/122627960.cms,"Representative image





Some Ontario drivers are voicing growing frustration over the widespread use of speed cameras, as a new petition gains momentum in Brampton calling for their removal.With 185 automated speed enforcement (ASE) cameras set to be active across Brampton by the end of the summer, critics say the system is turning roads into zones of constant surveillance, reports Inside Halton.“In the midst of an affordability crisis, inflation, rising taxes and economic pressure, families cannot afford to have their hard-earned money siphoned through automated ticketing systems,” wrote Carolina Cutruzzola in a Change.org petition demanding the cameras be abolished. “These cameras disproportionately impact working class individuals, many of whom are just trying to commute safely, efficiently and peacefully. ”The petition, signed by more than 4,100 people as of July 14, accuses the authorities of removing the human element of policing and replacing it with what Cutruzzola called “cold, impersonal technology.” She argued that drivers are under pressure and said: “We are human. We are not perfect. We are not machines.”Ontario first authorised the use of ASE cameras in 2017 to improve road safety in school and community zones where speed limits are under 80 km/h.The province says the goal is to reduce collisions and protect vulnerable pedestrians, but the cameras are controlled entirely by municipalities.Speed camera enforcement has been controversial in cities across Ontario. In Toronto, a camera on Parkside Drive was cut down for the sixth time since November, even after another surveillance camera was installed to catch vandals. In Vaughan, the programme was paused after it issued over 32,000 tickets in just three weeks.The fines, especially in designated community safety zones, can be steep. A ticket for going 10 km/h over the limit in such areas is $68.25, but municipalities often do not disclose whether any grace is given before issuing tickets. “Speed limits are not guidelines — they are the law,” the City of Vaughan noted.Ticket recipients often receive notice weeks later by post, and fighting them in court is difficult. There is no interaction with police, and the photo evidence includes the vehicle, time, location and speed. However, the tickets do not affect driving records or insurance, unless the driver operates a commercial vehicle.While the province says the ASE framework is meant to promote safety, critics argue it’s creating anxiety and raising money off working-class commuters. Some municipalities, like York Region, have brought in over $11.5 million since launching their programmes, raising questions about the role of revenue in the use of speed cameras.","185 automated speed enforcement (ASE) cameras set to be active across Brampton by the end of the summer.

Why Supercars? The Strategy Behind the Spectacle

Enforcement Efficiency: Dubai’s fast roads require police cars that can match or exceed the speed of offenders.





Public Engagement: Tourists frequently pose for photos with the cars, which strengthens the relationship between the force and the public.





Global Branding: The fleet projects Dubai’s image as a city of the future, rooted in innovation, luxury, and excellence.





Deterrence: The presence of high-performance vehicles serves as a visible deterrent to unlawful activity.





Sustainability: With growing EV integration, Dubai is aligning its law enforcement with green goals.





The Future of Policing?





In most parts of the world, police cars are designed for utility, not spectacle. In Dubai, however, they are a statement. Since 2013, the Dubai Police force has rewritten the playbook on law enforcement visibility by curating a vehicle fleet that looks more like an elite car show than a motor pool. With Lamborghinis, Bugattis, Rolls-Royces, and even a flying hoverbike, the Dubai Police fleet represents a unique blend of security, branding, and futuristic thinking.The transformation began in April 2013 with the induction of a Lamborghini Aventador into the police force. This was not simply about performance,it was about perception. The goal was clear: to elevate the image of Dubai as a global city of innovation, prosperity, and forward-thinking governance. Today, that vision is fully realized through a vehicle collection that symbolizes prestige, discipline, and a new form of civic engagement.Dubai’s roads are filled with high-performance vehicles owned by residents and tourists alike. To maintain authority and presence in such an environment, law enforcement vehicles had to match the city’s personality. These cars are strategically deployed in high-profile locations such as Downtown Dubai, Jumeirah Beach Residence, Dubai Mall, the Palm Jumeirah, and international expos,where they serve more as ambassadors than enforcers.While many of them are not used for daily patrols or high-speed pursuits, their presence deters crime and promotes a visible connection between police and the public.The Dubai Police force boasts a fleet of numerous supercars, but the exact number remains undisclosed. The collection is constantly evolving, and while not every vehicle is publicly confirmed, the lineup includes an unmatched variety of exotic, electric, luxury, and tactical models.The most expensive and fastest car in the Dubai Police fleet, the Bugatti Veyron is powered by an 8.0-litre quad-turbocharged W16 engine that produces 1,001 horsepower. It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just 2.5 seconds and reaches speeds beyond 400 km/h. Estimated at $1.6 million, it is a symbol of unmatched engineering and status.The flagship that started it all, the Aventador features a 6.5-litre V12 engine delivering 691 horsepower. With a top speed of 349 km/h and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 2.9 seconds, it turned the Dubai Police into a viral phenomenon practically overnight.Unveiled at the Arabian Travel Market in 2025, this luxury SUV comes equipped with a 6.75-litre twin-turbo V12, enhanced to 602 horsepower by Mansory. The bespoke widebody kit, carbon fibre bumpers, and elite presence make it a showpiece and mobile lounge for dignitary-related duties.Fitted specifically for Dubai Police, this €280,000 SUV includes sirens, emergency equipment, and a weapon-safe box. With 666 horsepower and a top speed over 300 km/h, it blends supercar speed with tactical utility.A recent addition representing the shift to electric mobility, the Cybertruck reportedly generates over 800 horsepower, accelerates to 100 km/h in under four seconds, and reaches estimated top speeds around 210 km/h. Its futuristic design aligns perfectly with Dubai’s branding strategy.Dubai’s electric ambitions continue with this sleek EV, introduced during the Arabian Travel Market 2023. It boasts 646 horsepower, a range of 472 km, and can fast charge from 5% to 80% in just 22.5 minutes. Used primarily in tourist zones, it also offers information and assistance to the public.This V8 grand tourer produces 542 horsepower and 770 Nm of torque, reaching 100 km/h in under 3.9 seconds. Designed for elite visibility and event-based security, it’s one of the most luxurious models in active rotation.Dubai Police’s first Chinese EV, this full-size luxury SUV features adaptive cruise control, a facial recognition interface, and acoustic alert systems. It marks the beginning of deeper tech integration into Dubai’s law enforcement strategy.Extremely rare and incredibly powerful, this 7.3-litre V12 supercar generates 750 horsepower and accelerates to 100 km/h in 3.7 seconds. Only 77 units were produced globally, making this one of the rarest police cars ever.Powered by a 3.8-litre twin-turbocharged V8, this British supercar hits a top speed of 333 km/h and exemplifies mechanical precision. It’s used for ceremonial events and official showcases.With a 6.3-litre V12 engine producing 651 horsepower, the Ferrari FF was designed in part with input from Michael Schumacher . It combines grand touring luxury with elite performance and a nod to Italian engineering.Another Mansory-tuned SUV, this G63 boasts 710 horsepower and off-road capabilities, blending utility with visual impact. It's built for both terrain patrol and urban presence.This luxury performance coupe produces 467 horsepower from its 5.0-litre V8 and reaches 273 km/h in 4.4 seconds. Acquired for AED 250,000, it’s a sleek, fast, and budget-conscious performance car.Based on the Chevrolet Tahoe and developed by W Motors, the Ghiath features real-time facial recognition, an AI surveillance system, and integrated command tools. Ten are currently in service, with plans to scale up to 400 units.Each of these serves a distinct purpose, whether for high-speed response, desert patrol, ceremonial display, or community engagement.A revolutionary eVTOL vehicle capable of hovering 5 meters above the ground and flying at 96 km/h. With a flight time of 10–25 minutes (manual) and up to 40 minutes autonomously, this quadcopter bike is part of Dubai’s vision of airborne law enforcement.Introduced in 2014, these eco-friendly bikes are used in malls, events, and high-traffic zones. They combine agility with sustainability and are often favored for their silent, quick mobility.Dubai Police maintains a mounted unit for night patrols in communities such as Al Qusais, Mirdif, and Jumeirah. Operational since 1976, this unit plays ceremonial and community-building roles.Used primarily for aerial surveillance, crowd control, and emergency response. These aircraft are deployed during major events, cross-border monitoring, and disaster preparedness operations.The Dubai Police fleet is more than an indulgence in wealth,it’s a strategic tool of statecraft, law enforcement, and soft power.In a city synonymous with ambition, opulence, and vision, the Dubai Police fleet functions as a bridge between symbolism and service. From the Bugatti Veyron to the Scorpion hoverbike, every vehicle in this unmatched fleet is part of a grander strategy,to redefine public safety as not just a necessity, but an experience. Whether it’s winning the hearts of tourists or showcasing the technological might of the UAE, Dubai has ensured its police vehicles are as unforgettable as the city itself.","Dubai Police use supercars like Bugatti Veyron and Rolls-Royce Cullinan to enhance public safety and showcase city’s luxury.

When Tesla was founded in 2003, its goal was simple but ambitious: to change the way we think about cars by making electric vehicles the future of transportation. Nearly 22 years later, Tesla’s reach has grown well beyond Silicon Valley, making a strong presence in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries. The company first arrived in the UAE in 2017, not just as another car brand, but as a catalyst for change in the region’s automotive scene. Since then, Tesla has carefully expanded into Qatar in late 2023 and Saudi Arabia in early 2025, tailoring its models and support networks to fit each country’s unique pace.Today, the Gulf stands as a vital market in Tesla’s global strategy, with even its flagship models available, a clear indication of the region’s accelerating adoption of advanced electric mobility and its rising significance in Tesla’s international growth.Today, the Gulf stands as a vital market in Tesla’s global strategy, with a full range of models available, reflecting the region’s accelerating adoption of advanced electric mobility and its increasing significance in Tesla’s global growth.Tesla’s first official Middle East entry began in February 2017, when it launched in the UAE with the Model S and Model X, sold directly via Tesla’s website and supported by a growing physical footprint.The company began deliveries by mid-2017, opening showrooms and service centers in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Sharjah, and laying the groundwork for a vast network of over 300 Superchargers—some of them solar-powered.As of 2025, the UAE remains Tesla’s most developed GCC market, with five models currently available: the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck.The Model 3 remains the brand’s most accessible offering.

Each launch aligned with local conditions, policy support in the UAE, rising consumer demand in Qatar, and Saudi Arabia’s broader shift toward clean energy and industry.Across the region, Tesla now offers a broad lineup, primarily the Model 3 and Model Y in all three markets, with the higher-end Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck available in select countries like the UAE and Qatar.

'I’m a Jew who lived...': William Shatner defends Elon Musk over Nazi salute claims; social media calls Star Trek actor ‘based’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/im-a-jew-who-lived-william-shatner-defends-elon-musk-over-nazi-salute-claims-social-media-calls-star-trek-actor-based/articleshow/122625384.cms,"Elon Musk's 'Nazi Salute': Weird Hand Gesture At Trump Swearing-in Event Draws Flak | '...Hitler'





Hollywood icon William Shatner has come out in defence of Elon Musk amid an ongoing controversy over a gesture the tech billionaire made during Donald Trump ’s second inauguration.A brief video clip had gone viral after it showed Musk lifting his right arm from chest level in a stiff, straight gesture and saying, “My heart goes out to you.” Critics online slammed the move as a Nazi-style salute, sparking outrage, especially in Germany. The footage was reportedly filmed during a factory tour on January 20, coinciding with Trump’s inauguration ceremony.However, the 'Star Trek' actor, who is also Jewish, dismissed the accusations in a post on X.“I’m a Jew who lived during the time of Nazi Germany in Canada. Do you think that if I believed even for a second that was an homage to Hitler or the Nazis that I would communicate with him; let alone follow him?” Shatner wrote.The comment came in response to a user on X who asked, “You don’t think Elon was doing a Nazi salute?”Musk has repeatedly denied that the gesture was meant as a salute, calling it “media propaganda.” Supporters of the Tesla and SpaceX CEO argue that the video was taken out of context and that the movement was likely just an awkward wave or misunderstood motion.While the Anti-Defamation League also weighed in calling the action “an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute,” critics and historians have warned it could encourage far-right groups.Social media platforms have since been flooded with posts either condemning or mocking the gesture.Shatner and Musk have a history of friendly social media exchanges. The two once joked about Pluto’s status as a planet, with Musk backing Shatner’s campaign to reinstate it. Musk has also expressed admiration for the veteran actor and self-described “Star Trek” fan.Online, Shatner’s blunt defence of Musk has earned him praise from some users, with many calling him “based” for standing by his convictions.","William Shatner has come out in defence of Elon Musk amid an ongoing controversy over a gesture the tech billionaire made during Donald Trump’s second inauguration.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

ChatGPT is not your therapist — Here's what that means for you,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-is-not-your-therapist-heres-what-that-means-for-you/articleshow/122629920.cms,"Why you shouldn't treat ChatGPT as your therapist

ChatGPT isn’t a licensed professional

It may reinforce unhelpful thought patterns

No personalised treatment plans

You might delay getting real help

Privacy concerns still exist

A recent study by researchers at Stanford University, highlights serious concerns about using AI tools like ChatGPT for emotional support. The researchers found that ChatGPT often fails to meet basic standards of therapy—it can unintentionally reinforce harmful thoughts, provide overly agreeable answers to serious mental health issues, or respond with stigma to sensitive topics like addiction or psychosis. In some cases, it even offered misleading reassurance in situations involving suicidal ideation. The conclusion? These tools aren’t built to handle the nuance, ethics, or responsibility required in mental health conversations. Using ChatGPT as a therapist might feel helpful in the moment, but it's no substitute for real, professional mental health support. With the rise of AI tools offering instant answers and emotional validation, it's easy to fall into the trap of offloading your feelings onto a chatbot. After all, it's free, always available, and won’t judge you. But here’s the truth: ChatGPT isn’t trained to handle mental health crises, trauma, or the deep complexities of human psychology. Relying on AI for emotional support can create a false sense of healing while leaving underlying issues untouched. Here's why it's risky — and what you should do instead.No matter how empathetic it sounds, ChatGPT is not a therapist. It doesn’t have degrees, training, or the human intuition needed to support you through emotional trauma, mental health disorders, or crisis situations. It can mimic supportive language, but it can’t offer a diagnosis or real therapeutic techniques.AI responds based on your input. If you’re spiraling or catastrophising, it may unintentionally mirror that language back to you, or offer overly neutral responses that don't help you break the cycle. This can reinforce anxiety or depressive thought loops instead of challenging them — something a trained therapist would actually help you do.Therapy isn’t one-size-fits-all. A real mental health professional tailors their approach based on your personality, history, coping mechanisms, and responses over time. ChatGPT doesn't learn about you as a person, it responds to prompts, not progress.AI isn't trained to spot subtle warning signs like suicidal ideation, dissociation, or psychosis. There’s no safeguard if your mental health is in real danger and AI will never tell you to seek emergency help unless you bring it up explicitly.Many users turn to ChatGPT because it's easy and anonymous. But this convenience can delay your decision to seek therapy, especially if you feel temporarily ""better"" after venting to a chatbot. Temporary relief isn’t long-term healing.Even though OpenAI doesn’t store conversations for model training if you opt out, there’s always a privacy risk when discussing sensitive personal issues with an online tool. Therapy offers confidentiality protected by law — AI doesn’t.A huge part of therapy’s power lies in feeling seen, heard, and understood by another human being. That emotional resonance, facial expressions, and real-time empathy are impossible to replicate with text-based AI. Real healing is deeply relational.You can still use AI in supportive ways as a tool, not a therapist. Try using ChatGPT for:Journaling promptsChatGPT can be a great supplement, but it’s not a substitute for mental healthcare. If you’re struggling, the best thing you can do is reach out to a licensed therapist, counselor, or psychologist. AI can offer words but people offer healing.","ChatGPT isn’t trained to handle mental health crises, trauma, or the deep complexities of human psychology.

Mark Zuckerberg is doing to AI datacentres what Elon Musk did to Tesla,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mark-zuckerberg-is-doing-to-ai-datacentres-what-elon-musk-did-to-tesla/articleshow/122658983.cms,"Source: Instagram/ Mark Zuckerberg

What these tent-based data centres mean for Mark Zuckerberg's AI plans



Facebook's parent company, Meta , is reportedly constructing some of its new AI data centres inside tents. This move allows the social media giant to rapidly expand capacity at its existing data centre campuses. The strategy essentially mirrors an approach taken by Elon Musk's Tesla in 2018. At that time, Tesla built a new Model 3 assembly line in just two weeks within a large tent outside its main factory. This quick setup significantly increased the car’s production, with the tented area reportedly contributing to 20% of all Model 3s produced that week.According to a report by Business Insider, a company spokesperson, while confirming the news, has emphasised that the entire ""supercluster"" facility isn't solely tent-based. This comes days after company CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company will spend tens and millions of dollars for several multi-gigawatt superclusters to ramp up its compute power.These structures will provide Meta the necessary push in quickly deploying additional AI computing power. Data centres contain complex and expensive equipment that requires precise temperature control to prevent overheating. Building parts of these facilities in tents suggests a prioritisation of speed over traditional construction methods, the report noted.According to SemiAnalysis (via Business Insider), Meta’s embrace of this ""speed above all else"" data centre design is ""inspired by xAI's unprecedented time-to-market."" The report added that Meta is already building more such facilities, a development that will likely surprise traditional data centre and real estate investors.SemiAnalysis, however, highlighted the use of “prefabricated power and cooling modules” and “ultra-light structures” to prioritise speed. However, operating data centres in tents presents challenges, particularly regarding heat. Tents can get very hot, potentially forcing Meta to temporarily shut down workloads during peak summer temperatures.As per SemiAnalysis CEO Dylan Patel, while Meta will likely build permanent data centres in the long term, the company needs these facilities operational “as soon as possible” in the short and medium term. He added that “everyone is trying to build data centres as fast as possible in the race to achieve AGI,” and Meta is using tents to “reduce construction bottlenecks” related to power, data center capacity, and construction crews.","Facebook's parent company, Meta, is reportedly constructing some of its new AI data centres inside tents.

OpenAI’s relationship with Microsoft and other cloud deals



ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has said that it expects to use Google’s cloud infrastructure for its popular artificial intelligence (AI) assistant. The reach to one of the biggest competitors of Microsoft – the tech giant company that has spent about $13 billion in the company – for additional capacity aligns with its desire for more computing power to meet heavy demand after initially relying exclusively on Microsoft for cloud capacity.According to a report by CNBC, OpenAI has added Google to a list of suppliers, specifying that ChatGPT and its application programming interface will use the Google Cloud Platform, as well as Microsoft, CoreWeave and Oracle.The announcement amounts to a win for Google, whose cloud unit is younger and smaller than Amazon’s and Microsoft’s. Google also has a cloud business with Anthropic, which was established by former OpenAI executives.The Google infrastructure will run in the US, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom, the report added.Last year, Oracle announced that it was partnering with Microsoft and OpenAl “to extend the Microsoft Azure Al platform to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure” to give OpenAI additional computing power. In March, OpenAI committed to a cloud agreement with CoreWeave in a five-year deal worth nearly $12 billion.Microsoft said in January that it had agreed to move to a model of providing the right of first refusal anytime OpenAI needs more computing resources, rather than being its exclusive vendor across the board. Microsoft continues to hold the exclusive on OpenAI’s programming interfaces.OpenAI and Microsoft’s relations have evolved since last year, with Microsoft naming OpenAI as a competitor last year as both companies sell AI tools for developers and offer subscriptions to companies.Sam Altman, OpenAI’s co-founder and CEO, said in April that the startup, which draws on Nvidia graphics processing units to power its large language models, was facing capacity constraints.“if anyone has GPU capacity in 100k chunks we can get asap please call!” he wrote in an X post at the time.",ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has said that it expects to use Google’s cloud infrastructure for its popular artificial intelligence (AI) assistant.
