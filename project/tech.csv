Roman Reigns comes face-to-face with Seth Rollins en route to Royal Rumble: SmackDown, Jan. 14, 2022

The traditional Survivor Series “WarGames” match is set to feature two Bloodline groups going head to head against each other. Roman Reigns ’ “OG” Bloodline is set to collide with the Solo Sikoa led Bloodline 2.0, in one hell of a contest. With Bronson Reed joining Sikoa’s side, the required 5 members are complete for the Bloodline 2.0. Now, after Solo cost Seth Rollins his match against Bronson on RAW last night, The “Visionary” is one step away from joining his former shield partner at Survivor Series WarGames.Here are three reasons why this will join the “OG” Bloodline at WarGamesSeth Rollins has twice in two weeks vehemently denied Sami Zayn and then the Uso twins from joining the OG Bloodline , led by the “OTC” Roman Reigns. Given his long history with Reigns, Seth is absolutely reluctant to join that group. But with Bronson Reed joining Solo’s side, it does add some extra motivation for the “Architect” to join his former shield partner Roman and friend Sami Zayn in the “OG” Bloodline, for the Survivor Series WarGames match .Solo Sikoa did not like Seth’s comments last week on RAW, when the Visionary denied joining him in the Bloodline, 2.0 group. Seth called Sikoa a “wannabe Roman Reigns” and said that he would never join him. Now that Sikoa has cost Seth his match against Reed on RAW last night, Seth will have a chance to seek revenge against Solo, if he joins Roman’s Bloodline in the Survivor Series WarGames.As much as he expresses his hate for Roman Reigns time and again, there is still some love left and Seth’s heart for his former Shield brother. Also, the constant requests from the other OG Bloodline members Zayn, Jimmy and Jey, the former WWE World Champion might just be tilted towards a change of heart for the “Head of the Table”. Moreover, with his current enemy Bronson being on Sikoa’s side, there is every chance that Seth might actually agree to be a part of the OG Bloodline for the Survivor Series WarGames match.","The traditional Survivor Series “WarGames” match is set to feature two Bloodline groups going head to head against each other.

A video claiming to show music mogul Sean "" Diddy "" Combs collapsing in court after allegedly receiving a life sentence has gone viral on social media. However, the video has been debunked as misleading, and the claims are false.Combs is currently detained at a Brooklyn facility, facing charges of coercion and abuse of women spanning several years.The rumor of the music mogul collapsing originated from TikTok user @wadewilsoncri, who shared a four-part video series on November 11 titled, “Breaking News: Diddy passed out in court after hearing his life sentence!” The videos quickly went viral, amassing over 413,403 views in just one week. The thumbnail featured a collage of a man in an orange prison jumpsuit sitting in a wheelchair in a courtroom, alongside an image of the same individual appearing to collapse.However, the claims made in the video are unsubstantiated, as Combs’ trial has not yet begun. No life sentence has been issued, and legal proceedings are still underway. Moreover, no hearings involving Combs have been live-streamed, making the existence of such footage impossible.Diddy has been accused of kidnapping, drugging, and coercing women into sexual acts, allegedly using firearms and threats of violence. In March, police raided his Los Angeles mansion, which had hosted his birthday party, and reportedly confiscated items intended for events described as ""freak-offs,"" including drugs and over 1,000 bottles of baby oil. Combs has denied all allegations and entered a not guilty plea.Despite two previous bail requests being denied, Combs' attorneys have filed a third appeal, citing newly discovered evidence. Prosecutors argue, however, that his alleged attempts to influence witnesses from jail demonstrate a disregard for legal processes.Combs is scheduled to appear before US District Judge Arun Subramanian in Manhattan on Tuesday at 3 pm EDT (2000 GMT) for a bail hearing. His trial is set to begin on May 5.","A video claiming to show music mogul Sean "" Diddy "" Combs collapsing in court has gone viral on social media.

Like a plant, I place my roots, drink in the nutrients of the Japanese language, sprouting leaves, flowers and bearing fruit,"" he said in a 2022 interview with The Associated Press at his Tokyo home.Tanikawa explored the poetic, not only in the repetitive music of the spoken word but also the magic hidden in little things.One of his works is titled, ""I wanted to talk to you in the kitchen in the middle of the night.""""In the past, there was something about it being a job, being commissioned. Now, I can write as I want,"" he said.In every work Tanikawa tackled, including the script for Kon Ichikawa's "" Tokyo Olympiad ,"" a documentary film of the 1964 Tokyo Games, the respectful love for the beauty of the Japanese language resonates.He also translated Mother Goose, Maurice Sendak and Leo Lionni. Tanikawa has in turn been widely translated, including English, Chinese and various European languages.Some of his works were made into picture books for children, and they are often featured in Japanese school textbooks. He also incorporated Japanese words derived from foreign origins into his poems like Coca-Cola.In his prose poem with that title, in which a boy is opening a Coke can, he wrote: ""If, for instance, he saw the infinite universe that started or ended at the tip of his can, he was totally unaware of it. One might be able to opine that he named every bit of the unknown about to swallow him with all the vocabulary he could muster, which included his future vocabulary that was yet dormant in his subconscious.""In his debut poem that catapulted him to stardom, he is more sparse:""Because the universe goes on expanding, we are all uneasy. With the chill of two billion light-years of solitude, I suddenly sneezed,"" is the way the poem ends, as translated by William I. Elliott and Kazuo Kawamura.When asked about it, Tanikawa acknowledged it felt as though someone else had written it, but noted he still thought it was a good poem.""Tanikawa's poetry reflects a metaphysical and quasi-religious attitude toward experience. In simple, spare language, he sketches profound ideas and emotional truths,"" according to the Poetry Foundation , a US literary organization.Tanikawa was born in 1931, a son of philosopher Tetsuzo Tanikawa, and began writing poetry in his teens, circulating with the famous poets of that era, like Makoto Ooka and Shuji Terayama.He said he used to think poems descended like an inspiration from the heavens. But, as he grew older, he felt the poems welling up from the ground.In person, Tanikawa was friendly and unassuming, often reading in public with other poets. He never seemed to take himself too seriously but used to confess his one regret in life was never finishing his education, having dropped out amid stardom at a young age.His relative isolation from the bleakly serious scholarly poetry scene of postwar Japan likely helped him take his free-verse approach that went on to innovate and define Japanese contemporary poetics.Tanikawa said he wasn't afraid of death, implying he perhaps meant to write a poem about that experience, too.""I am more curious about where I will go when I die. It's a different world, right? Of course, I don't want pain. I don't want to die after major surgery or anything. I just want to die, all of a sudden,"" he said.He is survived by his son, musician Kensaku Tanikawa and daughter Shino and several grandchildren. Funeral services were held privately with family and friends. A farewell event in his honor is being planned, Kensaku Tanikawa said.""As they did with all of you, Shuntaro's poems stunned and moved me, making me chuckle or shed a tear. Wasn't it all so fun?"" he said. ""His poems are with you forever.""","Tanikawa's ""Kotoba Asobi Uta,"" or ""Word Play Songs,"" is a rhythmical experiment in juxtaposing words that sound similar. Tanikawa's poetry reflects a metaphysical and quasi-religious attitude toward experience.

What makes the joke intriguing

When did it originate

The ""That feeling when knee surgery is tomorrow"" meme, also known as the Blue Grinch meme , expresses a specific emotional state associated with a pending knee surgery.The meme which gained widespread popularity, traces its origins to an earlier version featuring a squirrel image.The meme finds humor in a highly specific and relatable situation, creating an instant connection for those who have experienced the anxiety of an upcoming medical procedure, specifically knee surgery.The inclusion of the ""Blue Grinch"" character amplifies the sense of nervousness and lack of energy surrounding the experience.The humor lies in its highly specific focus, serving as both a commentary on traditional meme conventions and a departure from them, the Daily Dot reported.The meme focuses on such specific and nuanced situations that its precision itself becomes the punchline, providing a clever commentary on meme culture that is both humorous and insightful.While most memes strive for widespread appeal by tapping into universal emotions, the ""knee surgery"" meme maintains a deliberately narrow scope, which sets it apart.According to Know Your Meme, the first version of this meme was created in 2021 by an anonymous user on MemeCreator.org. It featured an animated squirrel standing upright with its front paws raised, capturing widespread attention when it appeared on the Instagram account stupid.fricken.meme later that year.At present, the ""Blue Grinch knee surgery"" memes remain notably non-political in nature. While it's common for memes that start as neutral to take on political or unexpected directions, this particular format mainly serves as a self-referential commentary on meme culture.(This is a top story on Google Trends)","The meme expresses a specific emotional state associated with a pending knee surgery.

The video in question originated from the May 2, 1987, episode ofand shows a dancer grooving to Nona Hendryx ’s song “Why Should I Cry.” Despite the resemblance suggested by some captions, there is no connection between the dancer and Donald Trump.Archives of Trump’s public appearances from the 1980s, including photographs from Getty Images, confirm that his hairstyle during that era did not resemble the mullet seen in the video.

During the late 1980s, Trump was focused on his real estate ventures and media appearances related to his business success, making such an appearance highly unlikely.Although Trump never danced on, his tendency to dance has become part of his public persona.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

New NPS rule from April 1 : The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has enhanced National Pension System (NPS) security by adding a new layer called two-factor Aadhaar authentication . Starting April 1, all users logging into the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) system with passwords must use this feature, as per the PFRDA circular dated March 15, 2024.According to ET, using two-factor authentication greatly lowers the risk of unauthorised access to the CRA system .

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Microsoft prepares itself to tackle another CrowdStrike-like Windows outage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-prepares-itself-to-tackle-another-crowdstrike-like-windows-outage/articleshow/115459381.cms,"As part of this commitment, we are introducing the Windows Resiliency Initiative, covering four areas of focus:

Strengthen reliability based on learnings from the incident we saw in July.

Enabling more apps and users to run without admin privileges.

Stronger controls for what apps and drivers are allowed to run.

Improved identity protection to prevent phishing attacks.

Microsoft introduces ""Quick Machine Recovery""

In response to a recent security incident where a bad update affected about 8.5 million Windows PCs and servers globally, Microsoft has announced updates to Windows Resiliency Initiative aimed at fortifying the security and reliability of its Windows operating system. This initiative includes core changes to Windows, making it easier for customers to recover their systems in the event of major disruptions.""We are committed to ensuring that Windows remains the most reliable and resilient open platform for our customers,"" the company said at Microsoft Ignite 2024.One of the key features of this initiative is the ""Quick Machine Recovery"" tool that has been developed in the wake of the recent CrowdStrike incident, which saw millions of Windows machines impacted by a faulty security update, this feature allows IT administrators to remotely deploy fixes to machines even when they are unable to boot properly.Microsoft claims that the feature will enable IT administrators to execute targeted fixes from Windows Update on PCs, even when machines are unable to boot, without needing physical access to the PC. The tool will be available to the Windows Insider Program community in early 2025.The Windows Resiliency Initiative also includes platform improvements designed to enhance control over applications and drivers, and to enable antivirus processing outside of kernel mode. These changes aim to provide a more secure and robust foundation for Windows users.“This means security products, like anti-virus solutions, can run in user mode just as apps do. This change will help security developers provide a high level of security, easier recovery, and there will be less impact to Windows in the event of a crash or mistake,” the company added.A private preview of the tool will be made available for our security product ecosystem in July 2025.","Microsoft introduces ""Quick Machine Recovery"" tool that will allow IT administrators to remotely deploy fixes to PCs.
