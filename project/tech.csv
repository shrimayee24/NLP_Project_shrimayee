Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shares 5 ChatGPT prompts he swears by for daily work that show what’s now possible,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-shares-5-chatgpt-prompts-he-swears-by-for-daily-work-that-show-whats-now-possible/articleshow/123559941.cms,"Satya Nadella’s 5 ChatGPT prompts for daily workflow

1. Predict key discussion points for meetings



2. Draft comprehensive project updates



3. Assess product launch readiness



4. Categorize time and focus areas



5. Prepare for specific meetings

AI-driven productivity at work emphasised by Satya Nadella



Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has highlighted how GPT-5, integrated into Microsoft 365 Copilot , has become an essential part of his daily workflow. Launched on August 7, 2025, GPT-5 brings advanced AI capabilities across apps like Outlook, Teams, Word, and Excel, analyzing data from emails, meetings, and chats to provide actionable insights. Nadella shared five specific prompts that he uses to streamline work, save time, and improve decision-making. These examples showcase how AI can anticipate meeting priorities, prepare project updates, track progress, and optimize scheduling, reflecting a shift toward AI-driven productivity at the executive level.“Based on my prior interactions with [/person], give me 5 things likely top of mind for our next meeting.”Nadella uses GPT-5 to analyze past interactions with colleagues and generate a list of five topics likely to be on their minds in upcoming meetings. By scanning emails, chat histories, and previous meetings, the AI anticipates priorities, unresolved issues, and recurring themes, helping executives prepare efficiently and align discussions with strategic goals.“Draft a project update based on emails, chats, and all meetings in [/series]: KPIs vs. targets, wins/losses, risks, competitive moves, plus likely tough questions and answers.”Another prompt allows GPT-5 to compile project updates by aggregating data from emails, chats, and meetings. The AI highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) versus targets, successes and setbacks, potential risks, and competitive actions. It even predicts likely questions from stakeholders and suggests thoughtful responses, ensuring concise, data-driven communication for briefings and reports.“Are we on track for the [Product] launch in November? Check engineering progress, pilot program results, risks. Give me a probability.”Nadella asks GPT-5 to evaluate whether projects, like an upcoming product launch, are on track. The AI reviews engineering progress, pilot program results, and potential risks, then calculates a probability of success. This probabilistic insight supports informed decision-making and helps executives identify areas needing attention before critical deadlines.“Review my calendar and email from the last month and create 5 to 7 buckets for projects I spend most time on, with % of time spent and short descriptions.”GPT-5 can analyze Nadella’s calendar and email activity over the past month to categorize his time into 5–7 project “buckets.” It estimates the percentage of time spent on each and provides short descriptions, offering a clear overview of focus areas. This allows leaders to optimize schedules, reallocate efforts, and ensure alignment with strategic priorities.“Review [/select email] + prep me for the next meeting in [/series], based on past manager and team discussions.”The final prompt reviews a selected email and prepares Nadella for an upcoming meeting by summarizing relevant past discussions with managers and team members. The AI suggests talking points, action items, and context-aware insights, helping executives enter meetings fully informed and ready to address key decisions efficiently.Nadella’s use of GPT-5 in Microsoft 365 Copilot reflects a broader trend toward AI-powered workflows. By automating routine tasks, analyzing complex data, and generating actionable insights, AI can save time, improve strategic decision-making, and enhance overall productivity. Many companies are now exploring similar AI-driven integrations to streamline workflows and boost productivity across multiple levels of their organizations. As organizations continue to integrate tools like GPT-5, executives and teams alike can leverage AI to focus on higher-value work while staying informed, organized, and proactive.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has highlighted how GPT-5, integrated into Microsoft 365 Copilot, has become an essential part of his daily workflow.

South Korea Phone Ban: ‘No more phones in classrooms’ South Korea announces nationwide ban; to be implemented in 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/no-more-phones-in-classrooms-south-korea-announces-nationwide-ban-to-be-implemented-in-2026/articleshow/123542944.cms,".

South Korea has enacted nationwide legislation banning smartphone use in school classrooms, with lawmakers passing the bill on Wednesday, August 26, 2025, to address growing concerns about smartphone addiction among students, as per a report by BBC. The measure, approved by 115 out of 163 lawmakers present, aims to improve academic performance and social interactions among children and teenagers, with implementation scheduled for the next school year beginning March 2026.The new legislation comes as South Korean educators, parents, and lawmakers have observed declining academic progress and performance linked to excessive smartphone use in educational settings. The ban encompasses mobile phones and other smart devices within classroom environments.The initiative aligns South Korea with several other nations that have implemented similar restrictions. Countries including Finland and France have established phone bans specifically for younger students, while Italy, the Netherlands, and China have implemented broader restrictions across all school levels.Many South Korean schools had already implemented various forms of smartphone restrictions prior to this nationwide mandate.The new law formalizes these practices and establishes consistent standards across the country's educational institutions.The implementation timeline provides schools and educational authorities several months to prepare for the transition and establish necessary protocols before the law takes effect in March 2026.The ban reflects growing global awareness of smartphone addiction among youngsters and its potential impact on educational outcomes. Educational institutions worldwide are increasingly examining their policies regarding mobile device use in academic settings.","South Korea has enacted nationwide legislation banning smartphone use in school classrooms.

What could change in the next reign

A new sovereign could:

Maintain the 2022 limits;

Tighten style/usage via letters patent (e.g., continued non-use of HRH); or

Ask ministers to explore legislation if removing a peerage were desired.

Bottom line

Facts today:

Talk has picked up again about what happens to Prince Andrew’s titles in the next reign. Several outlets claim Prince William wants a tougher line and could look at further steps once he is king. There is no official plan on record; the stories rely on unnamed sources and remain unconfirmed.In January 2022, Buckingham Palace announced that the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages were returned to the Queen and that he would not undertake public duties; at the same time, briefings confirmed he would no longer use the HRH style in an official capacity. He remains Duke of York and holds no front-line duties. None of that has changed.Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and, in some tellings, press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge. None of this has been announced; it is framed as a possibility, not a decision.A dukedom is a peerage, which is a legal dignity. Removing a peerage requires an Act of Parliament; the House of Lords Library is explicit on this point. The last time Parliament provided a mechanism to strip titles was the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, drafted for wartime enemies, hardly a ready tool for modern scandal.Any fresh action would almost certainly need new legislation.By contrast, styles (like HRH) sit within the sovereign’s power to define by letters patent, hence the 1917 letters patent that limited who is HRH. Using letters patent to refine style/usage is established; using them to annul a peerage would collide with statute and convention. In practice, government-backed legislation is the clean route for removing a dukedom.Prince Andrew holds a 75-year Crown Estate lease on Royal Lodge dating from 2003. Changing his residence would be a landlord-tenant and lease issue, not a simple royal edict. Reporting about pressure to move has see-sawed, but the legal baseline is the lease itself.Recent polling shows strong support for going further: 67% of Britons say Andrew should be stripped of his remaining titles; only 13% are opposed. That mood is real but policy still comes down to law and process.Any move to remove a dukedom would prompt debates on due process, precedent, and where to draw the line for other peers.Andrew does not use HRH, holds no military roles or active patronages, and retains the Duke of York title. Any further step is not something a monarch can do “on a whim”; it would almost certainly require Parliament. Until a legal route exists and is pursued, this remains talk, not policy.","Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge.

"Movement signatures: How we move, gesture, use facial expressions is unique; could be as different as fingerprint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/movement-signatures-how-we-move-gesture-use-facial-expressions-could-be-as-unique-as-fingerprint/articleshow/123483187.cms,"



MANCHESTER: The way someone walks, talks, smiles, or gestures gives a clue to who they are. Whether through the flick of an eyebrow, the rhythm of our walk, or the tilt of a head, movement speaks volumes.And my recent paper shows that people may have their own movement fingerprint. This is a style of movement that is characteristic of a person's identity. So, someone who uses expressive facial gestures might also speak with animated hand movements or walk with a lively gait. These consistencies could form a motion fingerprint that is unique to the individual.First, let's explore how faces move and why this matters.Everyone has their own style of moving their face, for example, how they raise an eyebrow, purse their lips, or squint when laughing. These patterns of movement help us recognise familiar people even when the visual quality is poor, such as in low lighting or from a distance. And as a person becomes more familiar to us, we become tuned to the way they move, learning their unique patterns of motion, just like we remember their face or voice.Human faces are constantly in motion; they blink, smile, grimace and talk, to name a few movements. Researchers categorise facial motion into rigid movements (such as turning or nodding the head) and non-rigid movements (like expressing emotion or speaking). It's the non-rigid movements that tend to be most personally distinctive.The way we gesture with our hands, shift our posture and tilt our heads all carry identity information. Gestures are often shaped by personal habits or cultural norms; for example, someone might habitually nod three times when agreeing, or use a distinctive hand wave common in their home country.Facial movements are synchronised with the way we sound. When we talk, our face plays a role in shaping the sound of our voice. For example, if you talk with a wide open mouth, your speech sounds deeper and richer. Studies show that people can match other people's voices to moving faces more accurately than to static ones. This suggests that dynamic cues to identity are present in the movement of the face and the sound of the voice.People with face recognition difficulties (those who are ""face blind"" or prosopagnosic) may be better at recognising moving faces than still ones. Typically, people who are face blind can see faces and the differences between them, but struggle to link the face to a specific person. Here, idiosyncratic information from movement can provide an additional clue to identity.Gait, a person's walking style, is one of the most studied body movements. Early research, such as a 2005 study, investigated participants' recognition of identity from gait using point-light displays. In this case, bright spots (lights) were placed on key areas of a person's body. All other visual cues were removed. Participants could only see bright spots against a dark background. The study found participants could tell fairly well who someone was from the way the spots moved.Characteristics such as stride length, limb movement, posture and pace form a consistent motion pattern that is unique and surprisingly difficult to fake, making gait analysis a reliable clue for identifying people.Movement fingerprintsMy review brought together evidence from behavioural and brain imaging studies to consider if such consistencies between different types of motion exist and how we might explore this phenomenon further. The paper proposes that people have an overall style of movement.More work needs to be done to find direct evidence of movement fingerprints. For example, we still aren't sure what part of the brain processes these movement-based identity cues.So far, research shows that the posterior temporal sulcus - an area of the brain located roughly above your ear on each side - responds not just to faces and bodies, but to how someone moves more generally. This area is active when we hear voices or see people speak, suggesting it may help link motion and sound. Also, this region plays a key role in allowing us to understand our social world, interpreting other people's actions, determining where they are looking, and picking up on social cues such as gestures, facial expressions and changes in gaze direction.However, it's probably just one part of a larger brain network involved in recognising others through motion.Real-world applicationsMotion-based identity traits aren't as stable or specific as fingerprints or DNA. They're what researchers call soft biometrics: useful but not always accurate.But as we better understand the link between motion and identity, exciting real-world applications are emerging.Motion analysis could support contactless identity verification from gait-based authentication at airports to gesture-based identification in smart environments, such as homes that respond to a user's unique movement patterns. In clinical settings, movement analysis might help support people with social cognition impairments, face recognition or movement issues. For example, helping a doctor identify changes in the way a patient produces non-verbal cues.But many questions remain. We still aren't sure how consistent motion fingerprints are as someone gets older and in different contexts. Individual differences in people and environmental factors like lighting, clothing or stress could affect them.Researchers also aren't sure how exactly we manage to understand all this movement in everyday life without even thinking about it.Figuring this out could not only help improve technologies like social robots and develop tools for people with recognition and communication difficulties, but also tell us more about how we process and react to other people.

Japan has adopted a high-tech approach to disaster preparedness by releasing an AI-generated video simulating a Mount Fuji eruption. The video provides Tokyo residents with a realistic visualisation of the potential hazards of the iconic volcano, a symbol of both natural beauty and danger, were to erupt. It illustrates plumes of smoke and volcanic ash rapidly spreading toward Tokyo, highlighting risks to health, transportation, power supply, and logistics. While there is no imminent threat, Mount Fuji remains an active volcano, last erupting during the Hoei eruption 318 years ago. The simulation aims to enhance public awareness, encourage emergency planning, and ensure residents are better prepared for volcanic hazards and urban disaster scenarios.The AI simulation depicts Mount Fuji emitting massive plumes of smoke and ash, which quickly travel toward Tokyo. Streets, buildings, and vehicles are shown covered in volcanic ash, and the sky is darkened, highlighting the serious health, transportation, and logistical hazards that could follow a major eruption.Though there is no indication of an imminent eruption, scientists stress that Mount Fuji is an active volcano.Its last eruption, the Hoei eruption, occurred 318 years ago, and the volcano remains closely monitored for geological activity.The video aims to help residents visualize emergency scenarios, an important step in enhancing disaster preparedness for Japan’s capital, home to over 20 million people.The Tokyo Metropolitan Government’s Disaster Prevention Division produced the video, showing the moment a woman on a busy street receives an emergency alert on her phone about Mount Fuji’s eruption. The narration warns:“The moment may arrive without any warning.”The simulation illustrates how volcanic ash could reach Tokyo within two hours, potentially causing:Such visualisations aim to encourage residents to plan ahead, including assembling emergency kits and identifying safe evacuation routes.Japan sits along the Pacific Ring of Fire, a geologically active region prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Over the years, authorities have emphasized disaster readiness due to the constant risk of large-scale natural disasters.In January, the Japanese government warned of an 80% likelihood of a major earthquake along the Nankai Trough within 30 years, intensifying public concern. While seismologists debate the accuracy of such predictions, these warnings highlight the importance of continuous vigilance and preparedness.The AI video sparked a mix of fear and reflection among residents. Social media responses revealed concerns about transportation chaos and summer heat challenges during potential power outages. Users noted essentials like water, food, flashlights, and stoves as critical, but also acknowledged the difficulty of maintaining comfort and safety under extreme conditions.Some critics considered the warnings alarmist, arguing that dramatic simulations may deter tourism or create unnecessary panic. However, authorities maintain that visual, scenario-based warnings are essential to increase public awareness and emergency readiness.In addition to AI simulations, the Japanese government has issued official preparedness guidelines for residents living near Mount Fuji.Recommendations include maintaining:A large-scale eruption could generate an estimated 1.7 billion cubic meters (60 billion cubic feet) of volcanic ash, with around 490 million cubic meters accumulating on urban infrastructure.

"Visa fraud: Indian-origin Rambhai Patel sentenced to 20 months in jail, deportation for organizing fake burglary",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/visa-fraud-indian-origin-rambhai-patel-sentenced-to-20-months-jail-deportation-for-organizing-fake-burglary/articleshow/123462340.cms,"Indian-origin man Rambhai Patel sentenced for visa fraud.

What is U-visa?







Indian-origin New York man Rambhai Patel, 37, has been sentenced to 20 months and eight days in prison in a visa fraud case that he pleaded guilty to. His prison sentence is followed by two years of supervised release and forfeiture of $850,000. After that, Patel is subject to deportation.Beginning in March 2023, Patel and his co-conspirator Balwinder Singh set up and carried out staged armed robberies of at least 18 convenience or liquor stores and fast-food restaurants across the United States, including at least five in Massachusetts. The purpose of the staged robberies was to allow the store clerks to claim that they were victims of a violent crime on an application for U nonimmigrant status (U visa). A U visa is available to victims of certain crimes who have suffered mental or physical abuse and who have been helpful to law enforcement in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity.During the staged robberies, the “robber” would threaten store clerks and/or owners with an apparent firearm before taking cash from the register and fleeing, while the interaction was captured on store surveillance video.The clerks and/or owners would then wait five or more minutes until the “robber” had escaped before calling police to report the “crime.” The “victims” paid Patel to participate in the scheme. One purported victim paid $20,000 to participate as a victim in one of the staged armed robberies. In turn, Patel paid the store owners for the use of their stores for the staged robbery. Patel earned approximately $850,000 in the scheme, all of which he is required to forfeit as part of his sentence.At least two purported victim co-conspirators submitted U Visa applications based on being victims of the staged armed robberies.The U visa is a type of non-immigrant visa in the United States created to protect victims of certain serious crimes who have suffered significant physical or mental abuse and are willing to assist law enforcement or government officials in the investigation or prosecution of those crimes. It was designed to encourage undocumented victims to come forward without fear of deportation, thereby strengthening public safety. To qualify, the crime must fall under specific categories such as domestic violence, sexual assault, trafficking, kidnapping, or similar offenses, and the victim must provide helpful information to authorities. The U visa grants legal status in the US for up to four years, along with work authorization, and after three years, holders may apply for a green card. Family members, including spouses, children, and in some cases parents or siblings, may also benefit through derivative visas, making the program a vital form of protection and relief for vulnerable victims of crime.","Rambhai Patel, 37, has been sentenced to 20 months and eight days in prison in a visa fraud case that he pleaded guilty to.

HUMAIN, as a company, is developing full-stack AI capabilities across four verticals:

Next-generation data centers High-performance infrastructure and cloud platforms Advanced AI models, including multimodal and sector-specific solutions Transformative AI tools for public and private sector innovation

Saudi Arabia has launched HUMAIN Chat, a conversational AI app developed entirely within the Kingdom, marking a major milestone in the region’s artificial intelligence ambitions. Backed by the Public Investment Fund (PIF) and built on the ALLAM 34B large language model, the platform is designed to serve Arabic speakers with linguistic accuracy, cultural relevance, and sovereign data control.HUMAIN Chat is the debut product from HUMAIN, a fully owned subsidiary of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. The company was established in May 2025 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman with the strategic aim of positioning Saudi Arabia as a global hub for artificial intelligence — with a specific focus on Arabic-language capabilities.The launch of HUMAIN Chat signals Saudi Arabia's entry into the global AI landscape with a sovereign, culturally grounded, and technologically advanced offering. The app is powered by ALLAM 34B, HUMAIN’s flagship Arabic large language model, which the company describes as the most advanced Arabic AI model ever developed.Initially available across iOS, Android, and web platforms, the application has been rolled out first in Saudi Arabia, with a regional expansion across the Middle East and a global release planned thereafter.According to CEO Tareq Amin (formerly of Rakuten Symphony), HUMAIN Chat represents a “historic milestone” in building AI that reflects Saudi values, infrastructure, and talent. He emphasized that this launch is only the beginning of a long-term journey to develop AI solutions that serve both regional and global users.ALLAM 34B stands at the core of HUMAIN Chat. This large language model has been developed from the ground up in Saudi Arabia, involving over 120 AI specialists, including 35 Ph.D.-level researchers and a team balanced in gender (50% women). The model was trained on one of the largest Arabic datasets ever compiled and then refined with input from over 600 domain experts and 250 evaluators.The app is built not only to be linguistically accurate but also to reflect Islamic, Middle Eastern, and local cultural contexts — filling a long-standing gap in generative AI for Arabic speakers.The development of ALLAM 34B builds on earlier models from the National Center for AI under the Saudi Data & AI Authority (SDAIA). According to an independent evaluation by Cohere on MMLU benchmarks, ALLAM 34B is now considered the most advanced Arabic LLM produced in the Arab world.The model is bilingual by design but prioritizes Arabic, aiming to serve over 400 million Arabic speakers and 2 billion Muslims globally — a user base historically underserved by mainstream generative AI tools.By combining technical sophistication with cultural sensitivity, HUMAIN Chat seeks to deliver a solution that empowers users to create, learn, and connect in their own linguistic and cultural context.CEO Tareq Amin stressed the symbolic and strategic significance of the release:“We are proving that globally competitive technologies can be rooted in our own language, infrastructure, and values — built in Saudi Arabia by Saudi talent.”HUMAIN Chat is the first release under HUMAIN IQ, a suite of AI-driven products and services that the company plans to expand globally. This initiative reflects Saudi Arabia’s ambition not just to adopt AI but to shape its evolution — with a focus on IP leadership, homegrown talent, and sector-specific AI applications.These initiatives are intended to drive exponential value, economic diversification, and technological sovereignty.The company emphasized that HUMAIN Chat will continue to evolve through user interaction, improving its performance and relevance with real-world usage.

What’s next?

Partial Lunar Eclipse: July 6, 2028 — a portion of the Moon will pass through Earth’s shadow

Next Total Lunar Eclipse visible from UAE: December 31, 2028 — coinciding with New Year’s Eve, offering another spectacular display

A dramatic and unusually long total lunar eclipse will light up the skies above the UAE on the night of September 7, 2025, turning the Moon a deep red during an 82-minute totality — one of the longest such events in recent years. The eclipse, visible across much of the globe, will offer residents and global viewers a rare chance to witness a breathtaking astronomical display, with public events and global livestreams planned.On September 7, 2025, the UAE will experience a total lunar eclipse, an event in which the Earth positions itself precisely between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow fully across the lunar surface. This alignment causes the Moon to turn a red, copper, or orange hue — a phenomenon popularly known as the Blood Moon.This reddish color results from sunlight being refracted through Earth's atmosphere, which filters out shorter blue wavelengths and allows the longer red tones to reach the Moon’s surface.What makes this eclipse especially notable is the length of totality, lasting a full 82 minutes, and the overall eclipse duration of nearly five and a half hours, one of the longest in recent memory. According to the Dubai Astronomy Group (DAG), the event is not only rare for its duration but also for its global visibility, potentially viewable by 87% of the world’s population.The lunar eclipse will unfold gradually through several distinct phases. Each stage offers a different visual experience, and residents in the UAE will be able to observe the entire sequence clearly:The most visually dramatic moment, totality, will occur between 9:30 PM and 10:53 PM, when the Moon is fully engulfed in Earth’s umbra and glows with intense red shades depending on atmospheric conditions.For the public, the Dubai Astronomy Group will organize a special viewing event in Dubai, allowing residents and tourists to gather and witness the phenomenon together. Details about the event venue and activities are expected to be announced soon. A standout moment will be a carefully planned photo opportunity: a Blood Moon rising behind the Burj Khalifa, captured in collaboration with renowned photographer Rami Dibo.To ensure global accessibility, DAG will also host a livestream of the full eclipse. The broadcast will feature:This global streaming effort aims to bring together astronomy enthusiasts worldwide for a shared celestial experience.Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are safe to view with the naked eye — no protective glasses or filters are needed. However, for those wanting an enhanced viewing experience, DAG recommends the following:If you miss this eclipse, there are a few more chances in the coming years:","On September 7, 2025, the UAE will witness an 82-minute total lunar eclipse, turning the Moon a vivid red. The eclipse, visible across much of the globe, will offer residents and global viewers a rare chance to witness a breathtaking astronomical display.

Britain agrees to drop mandate for Apple to provide 'back door',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-agrees-to-drop-mandate-for-apple-to-provide-back-door/articleshow/123395824.cms,"Representative Image





SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain dropped a request for Apple to create a tool to give law enforcement access to customers' cloud data.

Four men in Northampton, England, raced away from an Indian restaurant without paying their 200-pound (about Rs 21,000) bill, which led to a spectacular chase by the staff. According to a Daily Mail article, the event took place in the Saffron restaurant at around 10.11 pm on August 4.Men can be seen entering the restaurant in the widely circulated CCTV footage posted on Instagram. Later in the video, they can be seen rushing out of the restaurant's door after leaving their table. When they reveal their intent, a staff member may be seen pursuing them. According to the complaint by the eatery, those men ordered and consumed 197.30 pounds of food, which included lamb chops, several curries, and other dishes.The company later posted the bill on Facebook.

A chatty parrot with a knack for drug slang has helped British police crack down on a prison drug ring, squawking its way into an unlikely role in a major narcotics bust, authorities revealed this week.The Lancashire Constabulary filed charges against 15 individuals connected to the gang, which purportedly distributed drugs across Blackpool, England, from February 2023 to July 2024. The operation was orchestrated by 35-year-old Adam Garnett whilst serving a prison sentence, Fox News reported.The case unfolded after prison staff discovered multiple mobile phones and Wi-Fi routers during a search of Garnett's cell. This finding led investigators to his alleged associates, including Dalbir Sandhu, Shannon Hilton and Jason Gerrand.Subsequent home searches revealed heroin, crack cocaine, ketamine, cannabis, substantial cash amounts and mobile phones connected to drug trafficking A notable discovery came from Hilton's phone, containing recordings of her parrot ""Mango"" repeating ""two for 25,"" believed to be drug transaction terminology.Additional footage showed the bird interacting with money allegedly obtained through illegal activities.Video:""What's the most talented thing your pet can do? Sit? Give paw? How about speak?"" Lancashire Police wrote in a post on the department's Facebook page.""One drug dealer's parrot learned to say 'two for 25' - a phrase picked up as part of common language used by the organised crime gang run by her boyfriend. Not a phrase you want your parrot squawking when the police come knocking!""Investigators uncovered video communications between Hilton and Garnett, including footage displaying kilogram-sized cocaine packages, occasionally accompanied by drug-referencing song lyrics.Despite his imprisonment, Garnett reportedly maintained central control, directing evidence concealment efforts and maintaining communication with virtually all network members.Det. Sgt. Anthony Alves of Lancashire Police's West Targeted Crime Team commended the results, describing it as a ""coordinated and complex drug operation that extended far beyond prison walls.""""Garnett continued to run his enterprise while incarcerated, using illegal devices to maintain control. I want to thank my team, our partners at the Crown Prosecution Service, and our prosecution team for their dedication to bringing these criminals to justice.""He noted that warrants remain active for Chloe Stott and Ryan Black, requesting public assistance in locating them.Police reported additional evidence from suspects' devices included videos displaying large cash sums, drug-themed rap lyrics and documented narcotic transactions.Garnett received an additional 19 years and six months imprisonment, consecutive to his existing 15-year sentence. Hilton, 29, received 12 years whilst Sandhu, 41, was given 10 years.The operation formed part of Operation Warrior, Lancashire Police's initiative targeting organised crime, drug trafficking, exploitation and violence. Police and Crime Commissioner Clive Grunshaw supported the initiative and praised the results.""This sends a clear message: we will not tolerate organized crime in our communities.

Queen Elizabeth's grandson Peter Phillips chooses a ring with family history as he proposes to Harriet Sperling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/queen-elizabeths-grandson-peter-phillips-chooses-a-ring-with-family-history-as-he-proposes-to-harriet-sperling/articleshow/123133523.cms,"Credit: Karwai Tang/WireImage

A quiet proposal and a thoughtful choice

What the experts say about the ring

Who is Harriet Sperling?

Reactions from inside and outside the palace





Peter Phillips, the eldest grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II, has announced his engagement to nurse Harriet Sperling. The couple confirmed the news on 1 August and shared that the proposal came with a classic trilogy-style diamond ring crafted by Pragnell, a jeweler long linked to the royal family.According to a statement released on the couple’s behalf, both families were “delighted” by the engagement; a wedding date has not yet been set. Phillips selected Pragnell because the firm acquired Philip Antrobus, the workshop that made Queen Elizabeth’s own engagement ring in 1946. That historic connection gave the new piece an added layer of meaning.Jewelry specialist Tobias Kormind reviewed photos of the piece and described it as a timeless design featuring a central oval or round diamond flanked by two tapered stones. He estimated that a ring of similar quality would start at about £10,000, with the final price shaped by the exact cut and carat weight chosen by Phillips.Sperling works for England’s National Health Service and is the daughter of the late Rupert Sanders and Mary Sanders of Gloucestershire. She met Phillips last year, and the pair have kept their relationship largely private. Friends say she has already built a warm bond with Phillips’s daughters, Savannah and Isla, from his previous marriage.King Charles, Queen Camilla and the Prince and Princess of Wales were told of the engagement before it became public. Royal commentators have noted that this will be the first of Queen Elizabeth’s grandchildren to remarry and that the decision to honor her legacy through the ring choice feels fitting. Social-media responses have been mostly positive, with many praising the understated style of both the announcement and the jewelry.The couple are expected to spend the rest of the summer finalizing wedding plans and juggling family commitments. Phillips continues to work with the sports and event-management firm he co-founded, while Sperling will remain in her NHS post until closer to the ceremony.A small diamond ring cannot replace family members who have passed on, but Phillips’s choice links past and present in a quiet, personal way that seems to suit both him and his future bride.","Peter Phillips, the eldest grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II, has announced his engagement to nurse Harriet Sperling.

Walls Closing In? Meghan Markle Faces Royal Cold Shoulder Amid New Fears: Reports

Different networks, same idea

Anderson’s calm response

What critics say about Markle’s show

Positive buzz for Anderson

No reaction from Meghan





Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series. The former Baywatch star spoke about the issue on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. When Cohen asked her to rate, on a scale of one to ten, how much Markle’s With Love, Meghan looked like her own Pamela’s Cooking With Love, Anderson answered “One.” She added, “I didn’t invent cooking shows. She’s just doing her thing.”Fans noticed that both shows feature garden scenes, casual kitchen chats, and celebrity guests. Anderson’s trailer came out in October 2024. Markle’s teaser followed three months later. Online threads pointed to similar camera angles and even matching font styles in the titles. Some viewers accused the Duchess of releasing a “frame-for-frame” copy.Pamela’s Cooking With Love is streamed on Amazon Prime. Episodes show Anderson and a guest chef picking vegetables in her Vancouver garden before cooking a meal outdoors. Markle’s eight-part Netflix show centres on simple dishes and home-grown produce in Montecito.Both series mix recipes with lifestyle tips, but Anderson stressed that overlap is normal in food television.Anderson told Cohen she had only seen quick clips of Markle’s programme and did not spend time looking for likenesses. She joked that there is room for anyone who wants to share food and stories on screen. Her relaxed tone cooled much of the online debate.With Love, Meghan drew mixed-to-negative reviews (≈38% on Rotten Tomatoes; 37 on Metacritic). It briefly entered Netflix’s Top 10 in its first week, and mid-year engagement tallies cited by several outlets place it outside Netflix’s Top 300. Even so, Netflix has ordered Season 2.Anderson’s series has earned strong notices and a high user score on IMDb. Executive producer Jesse Fawcett said any comparison is a compliment because it proves their team set a trend others want to follow. Anderson plans to film a second garden season next spring.Markle has not commented on Anderson’s remarks. Sources close to her say she is focused on shooting new episodes and expanding her As Ever lifestyle brand. Observers doubt she will address copy-cat talk directly. They note she has stayed silent through similar critiques from Martha Stewart and Gwyneth Paltrow.Two stars can host cooking shows without a feud. Anderson’s light answer suggests she sees no threat. Unless Markle fires back, the story may cool as fast as it boiled up. For viewers, the choice is simple: prime-time garden meals with Pamela or California comfort food with Meghan. Either way, dinner is served.",Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Pensioners play a vital role in the social fabric of our society, and their financial security is paramount. To ensure continued access to pension benefits, annual life certificate submissions are mandatory for all pensioners. This process, which verifies the pensioner's living status, has been streamlined through various online and offline methods. With the recent initiatives to promote digital submissions, pensioners can conveniently fulfil this requirement and maintain their financial support.The requirement for pensioners to submit their jeevan pramaan patra is a critical process in ensuring the integrity and sustainability of pension funds. By providing multiple submission methods—both online and offline—the government is making it easier for pensioners to comply with this requirement. The ongoing digital campaigns further illustrate the government’s commitment to enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of pension services, ensuring that pensioners receive their benefits without unnecessary delays.The submission window for life certificates opened on November 1 for pensioners under the age of 80. This is part of an annual cycle during which pensioners must reaffirm their eligibility for pension disbursement. The deadline for submitting the life certificate is November 30. If the certificate is not submitted by this deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting in December. This requirement also applies to super senior citizens (aged 80 and above), who were allowed to submit their certificates starting on October 1, with the same November 30 deadline.Pensioners can submit their life certificates through several methods, accommodating various preferences and technological capabilities. Here are the options available:For those choosing to submit their life certificates online through the Jeevan Pramaan Portal, the following steps are involved:For pensioners opting for offline submission, the process is straightforward:If pensioners fail to submit their life certificates by the stipulated deadline, their pension payments will be halted starting the following month. However, payments will resume once the life certificate is submitted, thereby ensuring that pensioners do not permanently lose access to their funds, provided they complete the required process.In an effort to facilitate the submission process, the Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare (DoPPW) has initiated its third nationwide digital life certificate (DLC) campaign. This campaign runs from November 1 to November 30, covering 800 cities and districts. The campaign aims to promote the use of digital platforms for certificate submission, ensuring greater accessibility for pensioners.On the first day of this campaign, over 1.8 lakh pensioners successfully generated their digital life certificates, highlighting the growing adoption of technology among pensioners.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Former GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke had defended Microsoft 's controversial internal memo requiring managers to evaluate employees based on their AI tool usage , arguing that measuring artificial intelligence adoption should focus on cultural alignment rather than quantifiable metrics like code generation. Speaking on the ""Decoder"" podcast that aired August 7, Dohmke explained that simply counting AI-generated lines of code would be ""easily gamified"" and miss the broader point of fostering an AI-forward organizational mindset. Instead, he emphasized that evaluation should center on whether employees demonstrate willingness to learn and integrate AI tools into their workflow.The former GitHub executive backed a June memo from Julia Liuson, president of Microsoft's developer tools division, which stated that ""using AI is no longer optional"" and should be part of managers' performance evaluations. Business Insider first reported on the internal directive earlier this year.Cultural transformation over metricsDohmke characterized the Microsoft memo as ""totally fair game"" for 2025, suggesting that companies should expect employees to reflect on their AI learning and usage of tools like GitHub Copilot, Microsoft Copilot, and Teams Copilot for meeting summaries.The former CEO drew parallels to GitHub's company culture during his tenure, where every employee across all departments—from HR to sales to legal—was required to use GitHub's platform. He made clear that employees uncomfortable with this requirement could find opportunities at ""tens of thousands of other tech companies.""Dohmke described the evaluation process as ""more nuanced"" than simple usage tracking, focusing instead on meaningful conversations between managers and employees about AI learning and adoption. This approach, he argued, aligned with Microsoft's growth-oriented culture that prioritizes continuous learning and adaptation during his time leading GitHub.The stance reflects broader industry shifts toward mandatory AI integration, with companies increasingly viewing artificial intelligence proficiency as essential for competitive advantage rather than optional technological enhancement.","Former GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke defended Microsoft's controversial internal memo.

Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis on why high-skilled AI tools struggle at solving basic Maths problems,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-deepmind-ceo-demis-hassabis-on-why-high-skilled-ai-tools-struggle-at-solving-basic-maths-problems/articleshow/123572377.cms,"Problem with ""Jagged"" Intelligence

The Big Race to AGI

Demis Hassabis , the CEO of Google DeepMind , believes that a major obstacle preventing AI from reaching true Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a lack of consistency. While current models can perform incredibly complex tasks, they can also make simple, trivial errors that a human could easily avoid.In a recent ""Google for Developers"" podcast episode, Hassabis explained that while advanced models like Google's Gemini, when enhanced with techniques like DeepThink, can win gold medals in prestigious math competitions, they can still struggle with basic high school math problems. He described this as ""uneven"" or ""jagged"" intelligence. This term, which Google CEO Sundar Pichai has also used, highlights how these systems can be highly skilled in some areas while being surprisingly weak in others.Hassabis stated that simply giving these models more data and computing power won't solve this problem. He said that to achieve AGI, we need to develop new capabilities in reasoning, planning, and memory. He also stressed the need for better testing and ""new, harder benchmarks"" to accurately assess what these models can and can't do.Google and other tech giants like OpenAI are all aiming for AGI, the point at which AI can reason and perform like a human. However, current AI systems still face significant issues, including hallucinations, misinformation, and basic errors.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has a similar view. Before the launch of GPT-5, he told reporters that while it was a big step forward, it still wasn't true AGI. Altman said one key missing element is the ability for the models to learn on their own, continuously improving as they are deployed.Both Hassabis and Altman agree that while impressive, today's AI models are not yet at the AGI threshold. The next big leaps in AI will likely come from solving these fundamental issues of consistency and independent learning, not just from scaling up what we already have.","Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis believes consistency is the biggest obstacle to AI reaching true AGI.
