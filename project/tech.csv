Cam Newton Defends Shilo and Shedeur Sanders Amid Nepotism Criticism



Cam Newton Gets Real About Dating NFL Stars, NO. 1 Pick Expectations + Using ChatGPT To Get Girls!?

Shilo Sanders and Shedeur Sanders have faced an intense amount of criticism throughout their football careers, with many attributing their success to nepotism due to their father, Deion Sanders . While living up to Deion’s legendary legacy is already a challenge, the added scrutiny has made their journey even more demanding. However, NFL veteran Cam Newton is not swayed by the ‘unfair advantage’ narrative surrounding the Sanders brothers.Not everyone can be criticized as nepotism product, at least Cam Newton does not think so. During an episode of Unapologetically Angel, Newton recently pointed out the frequent use of the term nepotism, emphasizing, ""They come up with all types of societal words and this year we’ve heard nepotism as much as any other thing."" Despite the criticism, Newton stands firmly in support of Deion Sanders, praising his role as a dedicated father who is actively shaping his sons' futures.Newton's perspective on the issue is deeply personal, as he is also a father guiding his children through the world of sports. With eight kids of his own, Newton is no stranger to the pressures and responsibilities of parenthood. His eldest son, Chosen Sebastian, is already making his mark in football, basketball, and track and field, while his daughter Sovereign-Dior Cambella and son Camidas Swain are actively participating in multiple sports.Having been in Deion’s shoes, Newton understands the importance of providing opportunities for his children. He also acknowledges the stigma surrounding Black fathers in society and believes that Deion has shattered those stereotypes. ""What Deion Sanders has been doing and has displayed, has been nothing less of a proud father,"" Newton explained. He emphasized that Deion’s active involvement in his children’s lives challenges the misconceptions about Black fatherhood, stating that Sanders has been ""smushing, killing, flushing, and murdering any type of thought process of what a Black father would be in this country.""Interestingly, Newton himself is a product of nepotism. His father, Cecil Newton Sr., played as a safety for the Cowboys and Bills in the 1980s, which helped Cam access valuable coaching and resources early in his career. However, Newton argues that while connections can open doors, maintaining success requires hard work and talent, which Shilo and Shedeur have undoubtedly demonstrated.Deion Sanders' influence on his sons goes beyond the football field. He has been a hands-on father, guiding Shilo and Shedeur through their athletic journeys and helping them shine even in challenging environments like Colorado’s football program. Their success story in the Big 12, despite the team’s struggles, shows their talent and Deion’s dedication.Newton defends Deion's actions, stating, ""To have been doing what he’s been doing for all of his kids, not just one or two of them, has been commendable, and for anybody who doesn’t like it, you just have to ask what would you do in that situation… If somebody’s son is good enough to play, of course, you want your son to play for you and you’re lying if you don’t."" This perspective resonates with many parents who wish to see their children succeed.Also Read: Justin Tucker’s sexual misconduct allegations spark debate over equal treatment with Browns' Deshaun Watson While critics may continue to label Shilo and Shedeur as beneficiaries of nepotism, Cam Newton views Deion’s efforts as a blueprint of fatherhood — a father ensuring his children carry on his legacy. The journey has not been easy, but the Sanders brothers are proving their worth on the field, showing that talent and perseverance are what truly define success.","Cam Newton has defended Shilo and Shedeur Sanders amid nepotism criticism. Newton believes Deion Sanders is a dedicated father who is shaping his sons' futures. Deion has shattered stereotypes of what a Black father would be in the U.S., says Newton.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118563927,imgsize-61384,width-400,resizemode-4/118563927.jpg"

NBA Halftime Show Gets a Tollywood Twist with Allu Arjun’s Pushpa 2

Forget the sandalwood smuggling, Pushpa Raj is now trafficking global pop culture domination. Yes, you read that right. Pushpa 2 : The Rule, a film that's already ignited a firestorm of anticipation in India, has now crashed the NBA halftime show. Think of it: Allu Arjun 's swagger, Devi Sri Prasad 's infectious beats, and the iconic Thaggede le mantra echoing through an American basketball arena. It's a crossover so wild, you'd swear it was scripted by a fever dream.So, how did Peelings , the track from Pushpa 2, find its way onto the Houston Rockets vs. Milwaukee Bucks halftime stage? It's a testament to the sheer, undeniable power of infectious music and a cultural moment that's transcending geographical boundaries. A video capturing the spectacle has exploded online, showcasing dancers in vibrant blue and gold, channeling the energy of the song and, of course, the signature Pushpa Raj attitude.This isn't just a fun dance performance, it's a massive win for Pushpa 2. It's a declaration that Indian cinema, particularly Telugu cinema, is no longer confined to its traditional audience. The NBA halftime show is a coveted platform, a global stage watched by millions. For Pushpa 2, this exposure translates to unprecedented international visibility, building hype far beyond the film's initial release. It's a strategic move, a cultural infiltration that's cleverly tapping into the global appetite for vibrant, engaging entertainment.While Peelings is grabbing headlines, it's worth noting that this isn't the first Telugu song to grace an NBA halftime. Kurchi Madathapetti from Guntur Kaaram also brought the Telugu groove to the basketball court. However, the sheer anticipation surrounding Pushpa 2 elevates this moment to another level. The film's already established fanbase, coupled with the global reach of the NBA, creates a potent cocktail of cultural exchange.ALSO READ: Kyrie Irving Makes Fan’s Dream Come True with Custom Sneakers Surprise vs Los Angeles Lakers The Pushpa 2 team's ambition to go global is clearly paying off.

SAN FRANCISCO: In 2010, a woman in Sakura, Japan, posted photos of her well-manicured Shiba Inu to her digital journal. The dog, Kabosu , shot her owner a wide-eyed glance, a comic image that quickly jumped from Tumblr to Twitter to Facebook and to the rest of the internet.A meme legend was born. Someone on Reddit called the dog ""DOGE,"" a nonsensical nickname that stuck. Another minted a cryptocurrency in DOGE's name.Now, 15 years later, in the fast churn of internet culture, DOGE is considered very old. But try telling that to Elon Musk , who has co-opted ""DOGE"" for the name of his effort to gut the machinery of the federal government -- more formally, the Department of Government Efficiency.It is one of dozens of old-internet ephemera that are baked into his everyday vocabulary. A brief scroll through Musk's X feed reveals a menagerie of aging memes and lingo -- dad jokes for the very online. They include:-- Frequent references to ""420,"" a half-century-old slang term for smoking marijuana said to have started in a high school in Northern California. (After smoking what looked like a blunt live on the Joe Rogan podcast, Musk briefly changed his Twitter bio to ""420."")-- Regularly including the number ""69,"" a slang term for a sex act that has been around since at least the Kama Sutra. (Musk, who is 53 years old, is quick to point out that his birthday falls 69 days after 4/20.)-- Calling things that he supports ""epic"" or ""based."" These are adjectives favored by frequent users of Reddit and popularized by fans of Joss Whedon, a director who created the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer "" television series in the late 1990s and went on to direct two of the Avengers movies. (Musk has said he wants to create ""based"" artificial intelligence with his chatbot, Grok, and recently told Tesla investors he expected an ""epic"" 2026 ahead for the company.)Musk's slang may seem inscrutable to people who aren't steeped in online culture. But to his fans, Musk's dated sensibilities are a kind of internet comfort food -- and a nod to a shared, aggrieved worldview.Musk's posts are full of the language of warfare and conquest portrayed in video games. That loaded language is a rallying cry for gamers and others from Musk's very online world who -- if they have a common political ideology -- see in him someone who shares their skepticism of authority and their belief that America has gone too ""woke."" To them, Musk's online updates about what DOGE is up to come across as far more honest than a press release or news conference or -- worst of all -- something they read in the mainstream media. (It's a strategy that recalls Donald Trump's use of Twitter to signal authenticity during his first administration.)""We're living in the revenge of the nerds era,"" Hasan Piker, a popular, politically progressive online personality who is not a fan of Musk, said in an interview. ""This is the real, actual revenge of the nerds.""Musk did not respond to a request for comment.Every photo of Musk wielding a chain saw while wearing ""deal with it"" sunglasses indoors (another meme) represents a triumph of the nerd culture he has long identified with. On Wednesday, he attended the first meeting of President Donald Trump's new Cabinet wearing a T-shirt that said ""Tech Support.""His fans speak back to him in his language. They send suggestions on how DOGE can fix the government by dismantling entire sections of it, often coded in the language of images typically found on Reddit. (Wojak, a crudely drawn character popularized on message board 4chan, is a perennial favorite.)Musk prods his more than 200 million X followers for help with decisions in online polls. And he listens. The conversation becomes a feedback loop of insider jokes for the billionaire, who once hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" and prides himself on his sense of humor.""Anyone can find their own community, even if it's a community frozen in 2010,"" Brian Feldman, an internet culture writer who has long followed Musk's exploits, said in an interview.But to those steeped in modern internet culture, Musk's communication style is far from on trend. That is especially so when even current terms like ""no cap"" (translation: no lie) or ""lowkey fell off"" (waned in popularity or relevance) are already showing their age. As with recent questions about Musk's claims of superior video game skills, they see cracks in his supernerd facade.""More than people would like to admit, they often become trapped in the internet they first encounter,"" Feldman said.Last week, Musk appeared at a conservative political conference wearing dark sunglasses, a big gold chain and a T-shirt that said he was ""not procrastinating"" but instead working on ""side quests"" (a common practice in sprawling role-playing games). He played off the quote from Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita that Robert Oppenheimer said was going through his mind as he tested the first atomic bomb: ""Now, I am become Death. The destroyer of worlds.""""I am become meme,"" Musk said to a mostly mute crowd. ""There's living the dream, and there's living the meme, and that's pretty much what's happening.""Even some of his most fervent followers on X recoiled. ""Elon Musk fell off lowkey,"" one user wrote.Musk's online vocabulary is a reminder of 2010, when nerd culture was ascendant. Reddit was a meme factory for favorites like Lolcats and icanhazcheeseburger. Gamers gathered in web forums or on online role-playing games to hang out and fight through digital dungeons.This was also the beginning of Musk's metamorphosis from mere billionaire to internet celebrity. That year, he appeared as himself in the second ""Iron Man"" film. His online fans ate it up.All of this also coincided with the rise of Web 2.0, a more social version of the internet. Twitter -- long before Musk bought it and renamed it -- was a town square. Facebook moved beyond likes and status updates with "" Groups ,"" a feature that allowed people to form their own smaller communities. Chat forum 4chan was full of anonymous, often angry online trolls who bonded over vulgar behavior.While online groups had existed for years, the newer social networks were more tightly knit and rewarded the behavior that Musk often displays today. The right kind of posts could pick up steam and shoot across the internet.Provocateurs moved beyond small-scale trolling to aggressive mass movements, such as Gamergate, a targeted harassment campaign against a female game designer by video game players who claimed she represented a lack of ethics in games journalism. It morphed into a social movement that fought diversity, feminism and what gamers saw as overly progressive values in film, television, literature and the video game industry -- a viewpoint that Musk shares.Gamergate also signaled that digital demonstrations could, for better or worse, lead to real-world change.Musk's tweeting style changed from anodyne company updates to more overt trolling. In 2018, he tweeted that he had secured a buyout offer for Tesla for a stock price of $420. Once, when a competing car company tried undercutting him on price, Musk said that he would drop the cost of his Tesla Model X to $69,420.""The gauntlet has been thrown down!"" he proclaimed on Twitter. ""The prophecy has been fulfilled.""Unlike other tech billionaires, who seemed to live lives far removed from regular internet folk and became less online the richer they got, Musk was making himself relatable with memes, absurdity and relentless posting. And parts of the online world embraced him.""Many people find him off-putting, I think,"" coldhealing, a pseudonymous cultural commentator who regularly follows Musk and other social movements online, said in an interview. ""But there are many people who he resonates with, and even though I think it's 10% of the population max, it's an influential 10%.""Musk's online life became even more bombastic after the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. He attacked Tesla short-sellers and California state officials who wouldn't let him reopen a Tesla factory. In 2023, he even live-tweeted photos of himself driving to Mark Zuckerberg's house, threatening to wrestle the CEO of Facebook. (They were, at the time, in the throes of organizing a real fighting match between them. It never happened.)He posted himself playing video games such as Elden Ring, Path of Exile and Diablo IV. One of the world's wealthiest men was telling gamers that he was one of them.Mark Kern, a former video game executive at Blizzard, wrote in a post to X in February that people should not mess with gamers. ""We're forged by endless boss battles against impossible odds. We do not give up. We do not stop. We are the terminators of the culture war.""""Yes,"" Musk wrote, quoting the post.Conservatives who don't spend a lot of time online have also embraced the image of Musk taking a chain saw to what they see as a bloated federal government, even if many of them aren't exactly sure what he's trying to say or when they're supposed to laugh.""It's validation from people who have no idea what he's saying but still think he's speaking this expert language,"" said Feldman, the internet culture writer.But Musk may be finding his online limits. It was difficult for some of his followers to shake off his stage appearance in February at the Conservative Political Action Conference, which reminded them that it is hard to stay cool when you are, in fact, not very young. (Kabosu did not live to see the meme she inspired enter American political life. The 18-year-old Shiba Inu died last year.)""Anyone else feel the vibe-shift in tpot/tech?"" one X user wrote, referring to an online community called ""This Part of Twitter,"" which is largely composed of tech workers who have historically warmed to Musk. In other words, Musk was starting to look a little out of touch and increasingly unpopular.Nonetheless, Musk seems to be doubling down. His posting to X has increased in recent weeks, some days numbering in the hundreds.And he is still being validated by his fans.On Thursday, Musk posted another meme to his X account -- one of dozens of posts he had made that morning. In it was a photo of Mel Gibson as Mad Max in ""The Road Warrior,"" the early 1980s action thriller about a shotgun-toting nomad navigating a postapocalyptic world. In bold lettering, the meme said: ""Ladies, it's time to start thinking whether the guy you're dating has postapocalyptic warlord potential."" (Film buffs may note that Max's wife and son were killed by a biker gang in the first ""Mad Max"" film.)One follower replied with a photo of a man wearing a Trojan helmet and body armor with an assault rifle in one hand and a spear in the other. It was one of more than 7,000 replies.""Yup,"" the follower said, adding a fire emoji.","Elon Musk has co-opted ""DOGE"" for the name of his effort to gut the federal government. It is one of dozens of old-internet ephemera that are baked into his everyday vocabulary. To his fans, Musk's dated sensibilities are a kind of internet comfort food.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118668276,imgsize-31866,width-400,resizemode-4/118668276.jpg"

Who is Carl Feynman?

Carl Feynman , son of American theoretical physicist Richard Feynman , pioneered cloth simulation in computer graphics at MIT in 1986. He found AI's rapid progress both fascinating and worrying. After seeing an AI create a cloth animation in minutes, he shared his thoughts on X, noting how quickly artificial intelligence is outpacing human effort.“I’m outdone by an AI in a few minutes. They still pay me, but for how long?” Feynman posted, acknowledging how quickly AI models are mastering complex simulations that once required months of research and powerful computers.The conversation began when an X user shared their experience with Sonnet 3.7, an AI model with reasoning capabilities, which successfully generated an intricate cloth simulation in p5.js—a task that had stumped other leading AI models, including Grok 3 and o1 Pro.""Can you write the most intricate cloth simulation in p5js,"" was the prompt put by the X user.Recognizing the significance of this breakthrough, the user said: “Wow, Sonnet 3.7 w/ Thinking just solved a problem no other model could solve yet.”The reaction by Feynman to the simulation quickly gained traction, with the user pointing out Feynman’s legacy: “The man who literally invented modeling cloth in computer graphics at MIT in 1986 saw the video where Claude creates a cloth animation and says: ‘I’m outdone by an AI in a few minutes. They still pay me, but for how long?’”Carl Feynman, the son of renowned physicist Richard Feynman, made significant contributions to computer graphics by developing early methods for simulating cloth movement. His work laid the groundwork for realistic fabric simulations used in films, video games, and virtual reality. In 1986, his master’s thesis, “Modeling the Appearance of Cloth,” was a pioneering achievement in the field.Reflecting on that time, Feynman noted: “It took library research and cleverness and originality and months of work and days of time on big computers. Now I’m outdone by an AI in a few minutes.”While AI continues to break barriers in computational creativity, Feynman’s words highlight an underlying concern: the speed at which AI is advancing, raising questions about the future of human expertise in fields that once relied on deep technical skill and years of experience.","Carl Feynman pioneered cloth simulation in computer graphics at MIT in 1986.

Toddler Calls 911 For Doughnuts

An Oklahoma toddler took emergency services by surprise when he dialed 911—not for help, but for “emergency doughnuts.”The Moore Police Department shared audio of the call on social media, where little Bennett insisted it was a real emergency. Officers later showed up at his home with a box of doughnuts, making the toddler’s day. The New York Post first reported the story.In the 911 call, little Bennett first spoke gibberish before hanging up. When he called again, he got straight to the point, telling the dispatcher he needed doughnuts. “911, it is an emergency,” the child said. “An emergency?” the dispatcher asked. “Emergency doughnuts,” Bennett replied.""Doughnuts? I want doughnuts. Are you going to share your doughnuts?"" the dispatcher asked. ""No, I’m not,"" Bennett replied firmly.Despite the non-urgent request, officers decided to make Bennett’s day. The next day, they showed up at his home with a box of Dunkin’ doughnuts.""You called us about doughnuts,"" an officer said in a video posted on social media. ""We came to give you some doughnuts.""Bennett’s excitement was clear as he shouted “Yes!” and eagerly grabbed a doughnut with his brother.According to police, Bennett made the call using an old cellphone. While such devices can’t browse the internet or send messages, they can still call 911 in emergencies.In another post, the police wrote, “Old cell phones may be unable to use high-speed data networks, take photos or play music, but they can still call 911 in an emergency.

CIBIL credit score : Understanding your creditworthiness is pivotal in today's financial landscape, especially when seeking loans or credit cards. The Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited, commonly known as CIBIL, plays an important role in this regard by providing credit scores to borrowers.According to ET, credit score helps banks make informed decisions about extending credit cards and loans. Your credit history influences your CIBIL score , which is calculated using a special method.Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity. Ranging from 300 to 900, a higher score indicates a stronger likelihood of loan approval. Banks and financial institutions use this score to assess the risk associated with lending money.1. Go to the official CIBIL website and click on 'Personal CIBIL score,' then 'Get Your Free CIBIL score.' Follow the link provided and fill in all the required details.2. If you don’t have a PAN Card, you can use an alternative identification such as Passport, Voter ID, Driver’s License, or Ration Card. Enter the number of the chosen ID.3. Provide your date of birth, PIN code, and select your state. Finally, enter your mobile number and click on ‘Accept and Continue’.4. Authenticate your identity by entering the OTP (One-Time Password) delivered to your mobile device on the next screen. Click 'Continue' to proceed.5. Choose whether you want to link the device with your account. Select 'Yes' or 'No' based on your preference.6. Upon successful registration, you will see a page confirming that 'You have successfully registered!'7. Click on ‘Go to Dashboard’ to access and view your CIBIL score.The factors influencing the new CIBIL score, as stated on the CIBIL website, include:1. Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5. Number of new accounts opened and number of accounts closed: Opening or closing accounts can affect your score, so managing these actions wisely is important.","Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity.

Limit management



New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What is ‘vibe coding’?

Karpathy’s honest take on the limitations of vibe coding



Netizens' responses to 'vibe coding'

Andrej Karpathy , the former Director of AI at Tesla, recently defined a term called ""vibe coding"" that explains an innovative way of coding that relies on sophisticated AI tools, especially large language models (LLMs). In his X post, Karpathy described that vibe coding is all about completely giving in to the ""vibes"" of the AI, accepting the exponential power of current LLMs, and forgetting the nitty-gritty details of the code itself. It is a transition towards how individuals interact with code and AI, where the boundaries between human interaction and AI-based output become indistinguishable.Karpathy's ""vibe coding"" is a recognition of how sophisticated AI systems have evolved. In describing on X (formerly Twitter), he added that LLMs, like the Cursor Composer with Sonnet, are advancing to a degree that nearly eliminates the use of traditional coding mechanisms. Describing his own experience, Karpathy explained how he converses with AI tools almost in a passive manner—merely talking to them and having the AI handle the rest. This method eliminates manually typing code as well as keeping track of all the minute information in the program.Karpathy went on to explain his individual experience with vibe coding, discussing how he deals with the AI tools so easily that he rarely even notices the keyboard. For instance, he just requests the AI to perform simple tasks such as padding adjustment on a sidebar, tasks that would otherwise involve more in-depth examination of the code. He takes it a step further by approving all the suggestions provided by the AI, without even checking the differences or changes made, relying on the AI to fix the problem. If there are errors, Karpathy tends to copy and paste the error messages into the system without comment, allowing the AI to take care of the fix.This approach, while unorthodox, is functional for him, particularly for small, throwaway projects. Karpathy explained that he could still create functional projects without being forced to deeply explore the technicalities. ""I just see things, say things, run things, and copy-paste things, and it mostly works,"" he described, highlighting the seamless flow provided by the AI.Though appealing, Karpathy did admit that vibe coding is not perfect. Occasionally, the AI tools are not able to repair some bugs, and in those instances, he has no choice but to make random changes until the problem resolves itself. Although this method may not be suitable for long, complicated projects, it works well for fast, experimental, or recreational work. Karpathy has a chuckle about using this method, understanding its flaws but enjoying its effectiveness for particular tasks.Karpathy's concept of vibe coding elicited a broad spectrum of responses from X (formerly Twitter) users. One user commended Karpathy for being willing to adopt AI so comprehensively, adding that some programmers boast about writing all their code by hand without realizing that AI-supported developers might replace them in the near future. Another user noted that the degree of AI support in coding can be considered a continuum, with classical coding at one end and vibe coding at the other. Even Karpathy himself conceded that vibe coding is not yet in its ultimate version, implying there is still scope for development.Other users appeared to be entertained by the idea, with one saying that they had been doing something similar for more than a year. Another joked, ""What could possibly go wrong?"" reflecting the experimental and unpredictable nature of depending heavily on AI for coding work.","Andrej Karpathy, the former Director of AI at Tesla, defined a term called ""vibe coding"" Vibe coding is an innovative way of coding that relies on sophisticated AI tools, especially large language models (LLMs) In his X (formerly Twitter) post, he described that vibe coding is all about completely giving in to the ""vibes"" of the AI.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118659769,imgsize-35590,width-400,resizemode-4/118659769.jpg"

"Apple logo mystery solved: Designer Rob Janoff makes it clear logo has nothing to do with byte, Adam and Eve's forbidden fruit or Newton's gravity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-logo-mystery-solved-designer-rob-janoff-makes-it-clear-logo-has-nothing-to-do-with-byte-adam-and-eves-forbidden-fruit-or-newtons-gravity/articleshow/118634657.cms,"Apple logo 'Byte' theory debunked by Rob Janoff

“They are really interesting, but I’m afraid it didn’t have a thing to do with it,” Janoff said. “Somebody starts it, and then people go, ‘Oh yeah, that must be it.’ But it’s all BS.”

The story behind Apple's logo

Why Apple's logo has a bite: The real reason revealed

“It was initially meant to indicate that it was an apple, and not something else,”

“Metaphorically, the bite indicated biting into all the knowledge users would get out of this computer.”

Apple logo’s ‘Byte’ myth: The accidental wordplay that stuck

“I wasn’t computer literate enough to see that initially,”

“But I was like, there’s a bit of wit that will last!”

Apple logo’s timeless appeal: Simplicity, evolution, and a lasting legacy

“People can’t remember complicated things. They can remember simple things,”

The Apple logo , one of the most recognisable symbols in the world, has been surrounded by speculation and myths for decades. The logo’s distinct bite mark has fueled theories ranging from biblical references to technological puns. Many have linked it to the story of Adam and Eve’s forbidden fruit, while others suggest it was inspired by Isaac Newton’s discovery of gravity. Perhaps the most famous theory is that the missing chunk represents a play on the word “byte,” a unit of digital data in computing.However, Rob Janoff , the graphic designer behind the logo, has finally set the record straight. In a recent interview, he dismissed these long-standing rumors, revealing that the true reason behind the design choice is far simpler than many had imagined. His explanation sheds light on Apple’s early branding strategy and highlights the role of simplicity in creating a lasting brand identity.For years, tech enthusiasts and Apple fans have insisted that the Apple logo's bite mark was a clever nod to computing terminology. The theory gained traction across social media platforms like Twitter and TikTok, with users praising the design as a subtle yet brilliant reference to digital technology.However, in an interview with Creative Bits, Janoff debunked the claim, calling it nothing more than an urban legend.Despite the widespread belief in the “byte” theory, Janoff clarified that the bite was added for a much simpler reason—to ensure that the fruit was instantly recognizable as an apple rather than any other round fruit like a cherry or peach.The Apple logo was created in 1977 when Janoff was working for the advertising agency Regis McKenna, which was responsible for Apple's branding during its early years. At the time, Apple was still a small company, and its founders, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, were looking for a logo that would represent their vision of computing in a way that was both innovative and user-friendly.Janoff was given little direction for the design, apart from Jobs’ insistence that the logo should not be “cute.” Taking creative liberty, Janoff decided to use a simple apple silhouette, which combined a natural, organic image with the futuristic vision of computers.The decision to add a bite mark to the apple was purely practical. Janoff wanted to make sure that the fruit would be instantly identifiable as an apple, as opposed to a cherry, peach, or any other round fruit.Janoff explained in an interview with Forbes.Though this explanation is far less mysterious than the byte-bite theory, it highlights the importance of clarity in design. By ensuring that the apple was easily recognizable, Janoff created a logo that would become one of the most iconic symbols in corporate history.Interestingly, while Janoff never intended the bite to be a reference to computing, the pun was noticed shortly after the logo's creation. His creative director, Chip, was the first to point out the connection between “bite” and “byte.”Janoff admitted.Even though the connection was unintentional, the wordplay became an enduring part of Apple’s brand identity. Over time, the idea that the logo was a clever technological reference became so widely accepted that many assumed it had been the original intent.The original Apple logo featured a rainbow-striped apple, which was introduced to highlight Apple's groundbreaking color display technology. As the company grew, the logo underwent several changes, transitioning to monochrome and sleeker designs in line with Apple's minimalist aesthetic.Despite these updates, the core design has remained unchanged, proving the strength of Janoff’s original vision. He believes the simplicity of the Apple logo is what makes it so memorable and effective.Janoff stated.He also emphasised that adding a subtle “wink” or a hint of humor to a design makes it more relatable and likable. This philosophy has helped the Apple logo stand the test of time, maintaining its status as one of the most recognizable logos in the world.","Rob Janoff, the graphic designer behind the Apple logo, has debunked the 'byte' theory.
