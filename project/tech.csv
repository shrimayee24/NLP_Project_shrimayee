Los Alamos Daily Post

MUMBAI: Unknown possibly to many, just 48 hours after Donald Trump was formally declared presidential election winner, the US conducted on Nov 8 a flight test related to its nuclear weapons programme.Los Alamos National Laboratory -- one of the main centres of US nuclear weapons development -- launched a payload code named Cyclone-1 to evaluate how new components and technologies behave when released by a missile and in a space environment.The weapon-related payload was flown by Denver-based UP Aerospace’s SpaceLoft-20 rocket , and the lift-off was from Spaceport America in New Mexico.“The primary mission of the laboratory is ensuring safety, security and reliability of the nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile,” Stephen Judd, Los Alamos’s mission manager has been quoted as saying to. “To do this successfully requires flight testing to determine how things perform in environments similar to those experienced during a missile launch,” Judd added.Significantly, the crucial test comes at a time when the US is upgrading its nuclear warheads and designing new ones.According to Judd, flight testing allows for data gathering about how systems behave in various environments, such as different accelerations, pressures, velocities, and temperatures. Upon the rocket reaching its apogee -- the point furthest from earth -- the research payload was released and monitored by laboratory scientists through its descent back to Earth.During this flight, an onboard telemetry system transmitted in-flight information regarding the payload’s performance and its functionality. The Los Alamos lab is preparing for another four launches between this year-end and mid-Sept 2025.",The US conducted a flight test related to its nuclear weapons programme.

For the first time since the devastating fire of 2019, the eight bells of Notre Dame Cathedral rang in unison on Friday. The bells, housed in the northern belfry, were silenced after the fire ravaged the iconic landmark.Five years of extensive efforts have brought the cathedral closer to its former glory. The fire's damage to the northern belfry necessitated comprehensive restoration, including removal, cleaning and reinstallation of the bells.The bells chimed individually before harmonising for roughly five minutes, marking as milestone moment ahead of the cathedral's reopening, scheduled for next month. Philippe Jost, who oversees the restoration project, said, ""This is a beautiful, important and symbolic step.""The bells rang individually before joining in harmony for approximately five minutes. This test run precedes the official reopening ceremonies planned for December 7 and 8.Alexandre Gougeon, responsible for the bells' reinstallation, acknowledged: ""It's not perfect yet, but we will make it perfect."" He confirmed to AFP that the initial test was successful.Guillaume Normand, the cathedral's vice rector, expressed profound emotion upon hearing the bells' chorus, noting: ""It's November 8 and Notre Dame is telling us: 'I'm here, waiting for you'.""The bells vary significantly in weight, from ""Gabriel"" at over four tonnes to ""Jean-Marie"" at 800 kilogrammes.The cathedral's reopening celebrations are scheduled for December 7 and 8. Whilst specific programme details remain unpublished, Jost informed RTL that performances would feature ""great artists of international standing.""Reports suggest Paul McCartney, who has Paris concerts scheduled for December 4 and 5, might participate in the reopening festivities.Post-reopening, Notre Dame anticipates 14 to 15 million annual visitors, an increase from 12 million in 2017.The catastrophic fire in April 2019, shocked both Parisians and global onlookers as the UNESCO heritage site was engulfed in flames, resulting in the collapse of its iconic spire.President Emmanuel Macron had established a five-year timeline for reconstruction, aiming to restore the cathedral to surpass its former glory.","The eight bells of Notre Dame Cathedral rang in unison for the first time since the devastating fire of 2019.

What makes the joke intriguing

When did the meme originate

The ""That feeling when knee surgery is tomorrow"" meme, also known as the Blue Grinch meme , expresses a specific emotional state associated with a pending knee surgery.The knee surgery meme , which gained widespread popularity, traces its origins to an earlier version featuring a squirrel image.The meme finds humor in a highly specific and relatable situation, creating an instant connection for those who have experienced the anxiety of an upcoming medical procedure, specifically knee surgery.The inclusion of the ""Blue Grinch"" character amplifies the sense of nervousness and lack of energy surrounding the experience.The humor lies in its highly specific focus, serving as both a commentary on traditional meme conventions and a departure from them, the Daily Dot reported.The meme focuses on such specific and nuanced situations that its precision itself becomes the punchline, providing a clever commentary on meme culture that is both humorous and insightful.While most memes strive for widespread appeal by tapping into universal emotions, the ""knee surgery"" meme maintains a deliberately narrow scope, which sets it apart.According to Know Your Meme, the first version of this meme was created in 2021 by an anonymous user on MemeCreator.org. It featured an animated squirrel standing upright with its front paws raised, capturing widespread attention when it appeared on the Instagram account stupid.fricken.meme later that year.At present, the ""Blue Grinch knee surgery"" memes remain notably non-political in nature.

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109067339,imgsize-51000,width-400,resizemode-4/109067339.jpg"

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Cybersecurity and the growing threat of SEO poisoning

Importance of cyber hygiene for everyday users

In a surprising turn of events, internet users who searchmay inadvertently become victims of a sophisticated cyberattack. According to the New York Post, cybersecurity firm Sophos recently issued a warning, urging people to avoid typing this specific phrase into Google. Sophos explains that fraudulent links related to this search appear high in Google search results, posing a threat to users' personal information. Through an insidious technique known as "" SEO poisoning ,"" cybercriminals have managed to exploit this seemingly harmless search term, leading unsuspecting users to click on malicious links. Sophos’s alert sheds light on how hackers target ordinary searches to compromise security.The phrase ""Are Bengal Cats legal in Australia?"" might seem like an innocent query, but hackers are using SEO poisoning to infiltrate these specific Google search results. SEO poisoning is a technique where cybercriminals manipulate search engine optimization (SEO) to ensure their malicious websites appear at the top of Google search results. When users click on these seemingly legitimate links, they are redirected to malicious sites that can steal personal information, including sensitive data such as bank details and login credentials. According to Sophos, the links are particularly dangerous for users in Australia, as the hack only appears when “Australia” is included in the search phrase.Sophos has identified that users who click on these fraudulent links are at risk of downloading a program known as Gootloader. This malware infiltrates users' computers and enables hackers to steal personal information or lock users out of their systems altogether. Gootloader is a multi-stage malware that begins by embedding itself within the system, then spreads to extract data or disrupt user access. This program not only allows unauthorised access to personal information but also opens the door for further infiltration, potentially installing additional malware on the infected system.The specific search term, ""Are Bengal Cats legal in Australia?"" may appear to be niche, yet cybersecurity experts warn that this is what makes the threat even more dangerous. Because the search is relatively uncommon, users may not suspect it to be risky. According to Sophos, such seemingly innocuous queries lure people into a false sense of security, increasing their likelihood of clicking on malicious links without suspecting foul play.Sophos emphasises that SEO poisoning is a growing trend among hackers looking to infiltrate legitimate Google searches. By targeting niche queries that draw genuine interest, cybercriminals increase their chances of catching users off guard. The tactic allows them to capitalise on unassuming searches to execute complex hacks.To protect against this threat, Sophos has outlined several steps users should take if they believe they may have fallen victim to SEO poisoning:Sophos’s warnings highlight the need for heightened awareness among internet users and underline the importance of verifying links before clicking.Sophos’s findings illustrate how SEO poisoning is evolving into a serious threat in the cybersecurity landscape. By manipulating search engines, hackers now use legitimate-seeming results to trick users into clicking on fraudulent websites. This method bypasses traditional phishing tactics, instead targeting users through the search engines they trust.According to Sophos, this SEO poisoning technique is not isolated and has been used in other cases to promote malicious links to the top of search results. The hackers’ strategy involves disguising their sites with relevant keywords, misleading users into believing these are reputable resources. The practice has caught the attention of cybersecurity firms worldwide, as it reveals vulnerabilities within search engines’ algorithms that can be exploited to compromise users’ online security.Sophos’s alert serves as a reminder that practising good cyber hygiene is critical. Even basic online activities like performing Google searches can expose users to potential threats. Sophos advises that users take time to verify the legitimacy of any link before clicking, especially when it appears in an uncommon or niche search result. By hovering over links, inspecting URLs, and relying on trusted sources, users can minimise the risk of encountering malware.",Cybersecurity firm Sophos has issued a warning on the threat of 'SEO poisoning' Cybercriminals are using this technique to infiltrate Google search results.

What to expect from Apple smart glasses

Apple is reportedly exploring the smart glasses market and for that it recently conducted a study to evaluate existing products and gauge consumer sentiment. According to a report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, this ‘secretive research’ suggests that Apple may be considering its own entry into this growing segment after the launch of the high-end Vision Pro augmented reality (AR) headset.According to Gurman, Apple held studies while it was developing the Vision Pro, AirPods and HomePod. Also, conducting studies when looking to expand into a new area is a common practice for the company, the report added.Last week, Gurman said Apple’s initiative is called 'Atlas' and it started in October. An email was sent to select Apple employees that read, “Testing and developing products that all can come to love is very important to what we do at Apple. This is why we are looking for participants to join us in an upcoming user study with current market smart glasses”.By gathering insights from employees, Apple aims to understand consumer perceptions and preferences without revealing its own plans. Apple is reportedly evaluating smart glasses from competitors like Snap and Meta Platforms, with a potential launch date of 2027, though this is subject to change.These devices, while not full-fledged AR headsets, offer functionalities such as video recording, phone calls and music playback.“It’s a category where Apple is suddenly playing catch-up, despite all the work it put into the bulkier and pricier Vision Pro,” Gurman said.While Apple has made significant strides in AR with the Vision Pro, its bulk and high price point limit its accessibility. Smart glasses, on the other hand, offer a more lightweight and potentially affordable alternative.“The company typically limits these focus groups to employees to help keep its plans secret. With smart glasses, the company could approach the category from a number of directions. That includes essentially creating a version of its AirPods in glasses form. It also could push to finally make true AR glasses — taking the Vision Pro experience and squeezing it into a pair of spectacles that people could wear all day,” he added.However, achieving a truly compelling AR experience in a glasses form factor may still be years away. Even prototypes from Meta and Snap are reportedly still in their early stages.Earleir this year, a report said that Google is in talks with eyewear major EssilorLuxottica about bringing its Gemini Al assistant to its next-gen smart glasses.","Apple is reportedly exploring the smart glasses market and for that it recently conducted a study to evaluate existing products and gauge consumer sentiment.

Is Matt Eberflus’ time running out?



Matt Eberflus is HURTING Chicago Bears & Caleb Williams | Colin Cowherd NFL

As the Chicago Bears ' season spirals, questions loom over head coach Matt Eberflus and the team’s direction. Sunday’s dismal 19-3 loss to the Patriots has left fans and analysts wondering: Is Eberflus the right leader for this franchise? With rookie quarterback Caleb Williams struggling behind a crumbling offensive line, tensions are high, and a recent jab from a well-known columnist has only added fuel to the fire. Here’s a closer look at the fallout and what it could mean for the Bears moving forward.Also Read: With the Chiefs undefeated, their billionaire owner celebrates North Texas SC’s MLS Next Pro Championship victory Matt Eberflus’ time in Chicago might be running out after the Bears stumbled to a new low in their 19-3 loss against the rebuilding New England Patriots on Sunday. The performance was frustrating for fans and players alike, especially for their No. 1 draft pick, Caleb Williams. Expected to be the franchise’s savior, Williams struggled to gain any traction behind an offensive line that left him stranded, allowing a whopping nine sacks. His passing game was severely limited, scraping together only 120 yards amidst the relentless pressure from the Patriots' defense.This tough outing sparked strong reactions, including a stinging comment from American columnist David Kaplan. During an ESPN Chicago radio interview, Kaplan’s phone connection kept dropping, prompting him to quip, “Coach, your cellphone is as bad as the offense right now.” The humor hit home for frustrated fans who couldn’t agree more, as the Bears’ offense has yet to find its rhythm under Eberflus. (via: EssentiallySports)The weight of Sunday’s defeat seemed visible on Williams, whose dejected demeanor reflected the team’s ongoing struggles. With fans clamoring for change and the pressure mounting on Eberflus, the clock may be ticking on his time in Chicago.As the Bears face growing criticism and a rising sense of urgency, the question remains: Can Eberflus turn things around, or is Chicago headed for yet another rebuild? With their prized rookie quarterback struggling and no clear offensive direction, the team’s future is uncertain. If things don’t change soon, it could very well be the end of the road for Eberflus in Chicago, and the Bears may once again find themselves looking for a fresh start.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers compared to Michael Jordan’s Wizards Era after dispute with Jets HC Jeff Ulbrich over loss to Cardinals",The Chicago Bears lost 19-3 to the New England Patriots on Sunday.
