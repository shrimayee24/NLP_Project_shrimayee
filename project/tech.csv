Don't analyse the connections too deeply.

The game tends to employ simple links such as sounding similar, similar spellings, or common themes.

Example: ""dear"" and ""deer"" tend to be linked by sound, not by some elaborate relationship such as predator and prey.

You have only four guesses per puzzle per day, so every guess matters.

Don't mindlessly click—consider each set carefully before submitting.

Try to come up with at least three connected words confidently before trying a set.

The initial organization is deliberately mischievous to mislead you.

Shuffling the words may allow you to see new patterns or concealed connections.

A rare letter penned by Colonel Archibald Gracie , one of the Titanic’s most distinguished survivors, has fetched a record £300,000, a fivefold increase on its estimated price, at an auction in Wiltshire, as a new high price for Titanic correspondence was smashed.The letter, dated April 10, 1912, the very day Gracie boarded the Titanic, offers a chilling glimpse into the final days before disaster struck. Written on a Titanic letter card and postmarked in Queenstown and London, it is ominous in tone, with the following ominous words: ""It is a fine ship but I shall await my journey's end before I pass judgment on her.""Auctioneer Henry Aldridge and Son described it as ""a truly exceptional, museum-grade piece,"" saying it is the record price for a Titanic letter. Survivor letters of Gracie's stature are extremely rare, with this one never previously on the market.he four-page letter, written to a family acquaintance who befriended Gracie at the London Waldorf Hotel, is warm in its reminiscence about his earlier crossings on the Oceanic, remembering, ""Her sea-worthy qualities and yacht-like appearance make me miss her,"" while also marveling at the size of the Titanic.Days later, Gracie would be a participant in one of history's most horrific nights. Following an evening of squash, a dip in the ship's pool, and a Sunday church service, Gracie was rudely awakened at 11:40 pm by the abrupt shutdown of Titanic's engines. Without hesitation, he assisted women and children into lifeboats, procuring blankets to protect them from the cold.When the ship finally went down into the Atlantic waves, Gracie crawled onto an upturned collapsible boat with other survivors. In the blackness, frantic swimmers cried out for assistance, but fear of capsizing prevented those on board from taking on more. Gracie remembered with sorrow that over half the men holding on to the upturned boat died before dawn, exhausted and chilled.""In no instance, I am happy to say, did I hear any word of rebuke,"" Gracie wrote in his later memoir, The Truth About the Titanic, recounting the final moments of those left behind, some offering blessings rather than curses.Col. Gracie's eye-witness account is still one of the most detailed and graphic accounts of the tragedy. The auctioneers titled the letter an invaluable relic, ""It is impossible to overstate the rarity of this lot,"" they added. ""Written by one of the most famous survivors, it captures a moment frozen in time.""","Col. Archibald Gracie was one of the Titanic's most distinguished survivors.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO.

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

GTA 6 release and updates FAQs

What is the official release date of GTA 6?

Grand Theft Auto VI will launch on May 26, 2026, according to Rockstar’s announcement on May 2, 2025.

Why was GTA 6 delayed from 2025?

Rockstar stated that the delay was to ensure the game meets the quality expectations of players and the studio’s own development standards.

What platforms will GTA 6 be available on?

Although not officially confirmed, GTA 6 is expected to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Will there be new trailers before the release?

Yes, Rockstar has confirmed that more information and footage will be released in the months following the release date announcement.

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for GTA 6, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on AI replacing people: ‘You are not going to lose your job to an AI but somebody…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-on-ai-replacing-people-you-are-not-going-to-lose-your-job-to-an-ai-but-somebody/articleshow/121115018.cms,"Huang says there is a shortage of workers

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang offered a perspective on the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the workforce this week, stating that while every job will undergo change, the primary challenge for workers will be adapting to those who leverage the new technology.Speaking at the Milken Institute’s Global Conference 2025, Huang said, “So, all of you have heard a lot about job displacement.”“Every job will be affected. Some jobs will be lost, some jobs will be created; but every job will be affected,” he said.“You are not going to lose your job to AI, but you are going to lose your job to somebody who uses AI,” he then elaborated on a key distinction.He urged attendees to embrace the technology, advising, “Don't be that person who ignores this technology and this result loses you.”Huang, painting an optimistic picture of AI's potential to expand the workforce, claimed that there is a “shortage of workers.”“For the very first time in history we actually can imagine the opportunity…to put 30-40 million workers back into the workforce” through the implementation of AI,” he said.Underscoring AI's potential to bridge the digital divide, Huang highlighted its ability to democratize technology access beyond traditional programming skills. He provided an example to the conference attendees, suggesting that while many might not know how to program in languages like C++ or C, “100% of you know how to programme in AI,” referencing intuitive interaction methods like “vibe coding.”He explained this is possible “because AI will speak whatever language you want it to speak,” allowing users to interact by drawing schematics, speaking, or giving explicit or implicit prompts.Huang also stated that artificial intelligence is “probably our best way to increase the global GDP.”","Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, spoke at the Milken Institute’s Global Conference 2025.

(Albert Stumm via AP)

Residents of the Isle of Lewis in Scotland’s Outer Hebrides are reportedly grappling with a persistent, low-frequency humming noise that has disrupted daily life. According to a report in BBC, the mysterious sound, described as a “droning, pulsating” disturbance, is audible day and night across the island. Around 200-plus people have reported it, per a Facebook group set up to track the issue.Dr. Lauren-Grace Kirtley, who launched the “Hebridean Hum” Facebook page, told BBC Radio’s Good Morning Scotland that the 50hz hum is “incredibly intrusive and distressing,” causing sleeplessness, dizziness, headaches, and difficulty concentrating. “It’s impossible to ignore – it is like somebody shouting in your face constantly for attention,” she said. Kirtley noted the noise is strongest on the island’s east coast and less noticeable in its center.Local resident Marcus-Hazel McGowan, using amateur radio techniques to pinpoint the source, described the hum as inescapable, telling the BBC, “It is one of those you cannot escape from.” He ruled out Stornoway’s Battery Point Power Station, operated by SSEN, as the cause, noting the hum is constant while the station operates intermittently.McGowan also dismissed boats as a likely source. Theories circulating on the Facebook page range from a TV mast to tinnitus, with some suggesting ferry noise carried by persistent easterly winds, which BBC Weather data confirms have been prevalent recently. Similar low-frequency disturbances have been reported elsewhere, including Omagh, Northern Ireland, where a business was identified as the source last year, and Immingham, England, where the cause remains unknown. In 2013, a drone-like sound on England’s south coast was speculated to be mating fish calls.Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, the local council, acknowledged receiving reports from a small number of islanders. A spokesperson told the BBC, “The comhairle’s environmental health team is investigating and will liaise with those who have reported issues.” As the investigation continues, residents like McGowan remain determined to uncover the source, hoping to restore the peace they once cherished on the island.","Residents of the Isle of Lewis in Scotland's Outer Hebrides are grappling with a persistent, low-frequency humming noise.

A storyteller who brought sports to life



The NFL Network era and rise of The Rich Eisen Show

Rich Eisen is returning to ESPN—but with a twist

Rich Eisen is more than just a familiar voice in the world of sports broadcasting—he's a legacy. With a career spanning over three decades, Eisen has shaped the way millions of fans consume football coverage, from his early days at ESPN to becoming the face of NFL Network . Now, at 55, he’s making headlines once again as his show prepares to return to ESPN—where it all began.Born in Brooklyn and raised on Staten Island, Rich Eisen's passion for sports reporting began during his college years at the University of Michigan, where he served as co–sports editor for the Michigan Daily. After earning his master’s in journalism from Northwestern’s Medill School, Eisen honed his reporting skills as a local news writer before stepping onto the national stage.His big break came at ESPN in 1996, where he quickly became a fan favorite on SportsCenter, often paired with the charismatic Stuart Scott. Known for his dry wit and spot-on impressions, Eisen brought levity and insight to every segment. One of his most memorable moments at ESPN was breaking the news of Mark McGwire’s retirement in 2001 and securing the exclusive follow-up interview.In 2003, Eisen left ESPN to help launch NFL Network, becoming its first on-air personality. His role there has been pivotal—hosting NFL Total Access, NFL GameDay Morning, and Thursday Night Football coverage. He’s also known for his annual 40-yard dash in a suit at the NFL Scouting Combine, which evolved into the #RunRichRun charity campaign for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, raising over $5 million.Eisen extended his influence in 2014 by launching The Rich Eisen Show , a daily mix of sports, pop culture, and humor. The show found success across platforms—first on DirecTV, then YouTube, NBCSN, Peacock, and currently on The Roku Channel.Now, after more than two decades, Eisen is headed back to ESPN—sort of. According to The Athletic, The Rich Eisen Show will join ESPN’s direct-to-consumer platform in the fall. It won’t air on traditional ESPN TV channels but will stream on ESPN+, Disney+, and possibly ESPN Radio. Like Pat McAfee, Eisen will reportedly retain ownership and editorial control of his show.Also Read: Tua Tagovailoa under fire as mounting injury doubts and locker room whispers fuel talk of a brewing Dolphins betrayal With this strategic move, ESPN is betting on Eisen’s credibility, humor, and die-hard fan following to boost its growing streaming footprint.

Leaked video adds fuel to growing GTA 6 rumors and speculation



Gaming community remains divided as Rockstar maintains silence on GTA 6 leak



A recent video posted by Instagram account owner @skibidinicky, who says she is a Rockstar Games illustrator, has revived speculation about possible leaks of the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI . The video depicts a PlayStation 5 menu with ""Grand Theft Auto VI, Closed Test (RC7201)"" displayed, showing 58 trophies, 23 hours of playtime, and 7% completion. Although some believe this to be proof of an internal beta test, others are skeptical about its validity since there has been no official word from Rockstar Games.The video making the rounds, uploaded by @skibidinicky, features a PS5 dashboard with ""Grand Theft Auto VI, Closed Test (RC7201)"" as one of the recently played games. The information shows 58 trophies, six of which are unlocked, and a 23-hour total playtime, indicating a 7% rate of completion. This comes after previous screenshots that were posted by the same individual, showing equivalent information. The similarity between the video and prior images has seen some believe the leak to be genuine.In her Instagram bio, @skibidinicky presents herself as a Rockstar Games illustrator, which lends some credibility to her assertions. Rockstar Games has made no statements, however, about the validity of these posts. The lack of gameplay footage or dynamic menu navigation in the video makes it difficult to confirm the validity of the content.The gaming community remains divided over the authenticity of the video. Some fans argue that the detailed information and the user's claim of affiliation with Rockstar suggest a genuine leak from an internal beta test. Others argue that the video might be a sophisticated hoax, perhaps using edited film to give the impression of having access to a closed test build of GTA 6.Rockstar Games' silence on the matter has only fueled speculation. The company is known for its strict confidentiality regarding unreleased projects, making it unlikely for an employee to share such information publicly without repercussions. The lack of official confirmation has led many to approach the leak with skepticism, awaiting more concrete evidence or statements from the developers.While the video posted by @skibidinicky has brought more depth to the debate on GTA 6 leaks , a lack of confirmation by Rockstar Games puts the community in limbo. In the meanwhile, fans are advised to remain cautious about such leaks and stick to credible sources for announcements regarding the much-awaited title.Also Read: Rockstar pokes fun at past leaks in GTA 6 trailer 2's opening scene","Leaked video adds fuel to growing GTA 6 rumors and speculation.

What is Teabagging in Call of Duty and can you get banned?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/call-of-duty/what-is-teabagging-in-call-of-duty-and-can-you-get-banned/articleshow/121118522.cms,"Image via Activision

What is teabagging and can you get banned for it in Call of Duty

This is the official Call of Duty code of conduct (Image via Activision)

“We do not tolerate bullying or harassment, including derogatory comments based on race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, culture, faith, mental or physical abilities, or country of origin, or the amplification of any person, agenda, or movement that promotes discrimination or violence based on the above. All members of our community should be treated with dignity and respect. Communication with others, whether using text or voice chat, must be free of offensive or harmful language. Hate speech and discriminatory language is offensive and unacceptable, as is harassment and threatening another player.”

Call of Duty is among the most popular shooters in the world, and like several other titles, players often end up developing their own slang, gestures, and in-game habits. Some of these habits go beyond the regular gameplay mechanics and you can find them to be a bit controversial. Among them is teabagging, which is a term that has been around for a long time within the gaming community.If you are an avid gamer, you could have heard about or actually performed the act of teabagging. Essentially, it is a way of taunting other players, and there are mixed opinions about the same. Some consider that it is harmless taunting; however, there are also others who see it to be toxic and disrespectful.This article answers the question of whether you can get banned for teabagging opponents in Call of Duty.In simple terms, you can understand teabagging to be an act of repeatedly crouching over the body of an enemy that you have taken down. Within Call of Duty, you simply perform this after you manage to kill an opponent, standing tall over their dead body. Although there is no actual gameplay advantage to this, the act of teabagging is believed to be mockery and taunting.To answer the question about whether teabagging is a bannable offense, we will have to check out Activision ’s Call of Duty Code of Conduct . Essentially, the code of conduct doesn’t explicitly list it as a bannable offense. Thus, you cannot get banned for solely tea bagging your opponents in Call of Duty.However, you must keep in mind that other forms of toxicity alongside teabagging can land you in trouble. The Code of Conduct states the following:Accordingly, if you are engaging in any of these acts, you could end up possibly getting banned in Call of Duty. It is important to ensure that the overall gaming environment is safe for everyone to enjoy.In recent times, a post has been spreading on social media platforms stating that teabagging or diddying is a bannable offense. However, it must be noted that the image is not true, and you won’t be banned for the same. Instances like this occur occasionally, with fake images spreading on social media, creating confusion over players.To conclude it all, it can be stated that teabagging isn’t a bannable offense, but it is important to ensure that the gaming environment is free of toxicity for everyone.","Teabagging is an act of repeatedly crouching over the body of an enemy that you have taken down.

Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2

Read More:

GTA 6 was initially slated to be released in the fall of 2025. However, everything changed when Rockstar dropped the release date in the beginning of this month. The game is now going to be released on May 26, 2026.Along with the release date, fans got another solid update a few days after in the form of the highly anticipated Trailer 2. Just like Trailer 1 and the release date launch, Trailer 2 also mentioned the launch of GTA 6 on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 5 Pro and Xbox Series X/S. However, what about the PC fans then?When the Trailer 1 released in December 2023, it left a lot of loose ends. However, a lot of them were sorted out when the Trailer 2 dropped. But it didn’t answer the long-awaited question, ""when will GTA be released on PC?”As per the initial release window, everyone thought GTA 6 will be available on PC after one year of its console release, that is in 2026. However, the console launch is now shifted in 2026 itself, consequently pushing the PC release as well.Now if we follow the past trends of Rockstar Games in terms of releasing GTA installments on PC, then we might get a speculative release date. GTA 4 first launched on PS3 and Xbox 360 in April 2008, and in just eight months, launched on PC.Although, it’s worthy successor, GTA 5, took almost two years to release on PC after being launched on consoles in 2013. So, it means Rockstar poses a clear habit of releasing PC ports a bit later than the console launch.Obviously it has its own reason as well and that is proper optimization. Besides being one of the best games ever, GTA 5 is also one of the most graphically well optimized titles as well. And the credit goes to the two years gap between the console and PC launch.Actually, developing a game for console is a bit easier as compared to PC ports because in consoles, developers get a standard hardware combination for systems to try on. However, in the case of PCs, there are innumerable hardware configurations.So, to make it optimized for all kinds of PC specs, developers will surely need some time. And keeping in mind the graphical intensity and hardware specification demands of GTA 6 , this game might take the longest time to surface on PCs.Rockstar is also not going to make the blunder with GTA 6, what it did with GTA 4. GTA 4 was an absolute mess on PCs, having poor optimization. Many things the short span of eight months wasn’t enough to shift from consoles to PCs, but Rockstar hasn’t yet fixed it even today, whereas the modders did.Now it’s time for the verdict. When will GTA 6 be available on PC? Actually it doesn’t have a proper answer, but players shouldn’t expect the game at least until 2027. They might have to wait longer, and only Rockstar has the definite answer.","GTA 6 was initially slated to be released in the fall of 2025. The game is now going to bereleased on May 26, 2026.

Is Escoffier worth pulling?

Do not bother leveling up her Normal Attack talent.Escoffier works in Cryo Hydro core teams because her kit suits Freeze compositions. She pairs well with:Her ability to reduce resistance helps amplify the performance of characters who might have trouble dealing with tougher enemies.If you want a character who provides consistent off-field Cryo damage, heals the team, weakens enemies’ resistance, and offers versatile support, Escoffier is worth investing in.

Fortnite leaks hint at 'Glider release' feature for quicker landings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/fortnite/fortnite-leaks-hint-at-glider-release-feature-for-quicker-landings/articleshow/121112924.cms,"Image via Epic Games

What is the Glider release mechanic?

Potential impact on competitive and casual matches

Fortnite players may soon get a new way to drop into battle, thanks to a leaked feature that could significantly change early-game strategies. According to several reliable sources in the Fortnite community, Epic Games is testing a “Glider Release” mechanic, allowing players to cut their glider mid-air and hit the ground faster than ever before.The information, first leaked by well-known Fortnite data miner @Wensoing and later confirmed by @HYPEX on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), has sparked discussions among fans and competitive players alike.As it stands, players in Fortnite are required to glide a fixed distance before hitting the ground. The glider automatically opens once they reach a certain height, which helps prevent fall damage but often slows down landings significantly.The Glider Release mechanic appears to change that. According to leaks, players will be able to manually open - and then release, their glider during descent. This gives them more control over landing speed and location, but also introduces the threat of fall damage if they drop from too high.The mechanic could introduce a new skill gap, rewarding experienced players who can calculate the optimal point to release their glider and land without damage.Early landings are a key part of Fortnite, especially in competitive modes where getting to high-value loot areas first can decide the outcome of a match. With Glider Releasing, players might reach the ground much faster, helping them grab weapons and secure positions before anyone else.Some leaks suggest that landing in water will negate fall damage, something already seen in other parts of the game. This could lead to new strategies, such as aiming for lakes or rivers to land safely while descending at full speed.However, the community has also expressed concern. If players can drop too quickly, there’s a chance it could unbalance the game, especially in competitive play. Some fans worry about exploits, like diving from maximum height to beat other players to the ground every time.For now, the Glider Release mechanic remains just a leak, nothing has been officially announced by Epic Games. But with multiple reputable insiders discussing it, there’s a good chance we may see it tested or introduced in a future update.Whether it adds more excitement or causes gameplay issues, one thing is clear - Fortnite may be getting a fresh twist to how matches begin.","Glider Release mechanic could allow players to cut their glider mid-air.
