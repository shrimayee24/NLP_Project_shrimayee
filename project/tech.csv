YouTube new monetisation rules: Why the 2025 policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

YouTube monetisation policy update 2025 FAQs



1. When do the new rules start?

2. What exactly counts as “mass-produced” or “repetitious” content?

3. Are AI-generated videos banned from monetisation?

4. Do the subscriber and watch-time thresholds change?

5. What happens if my channel is flagged for inauthentic uploads?

6. Are reaction videos or clip compilations automatically disqualified?

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety, accountability, and protecting minors from online harassment, inappropriate content, live chat abuse, privacy violations, and potential exploitation during livestreams.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue. Simple re-uploads or minimal edits will not qualify.","On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.

It added ""deprecated code made @grok susceptible to existing X user posts; including when such posts contained extremist views.""The AI startup said the problems began with a code update Monday that restored an older set of instructions the company had used to guide Grok. The issues continued until the account was temporarily disabled Tuesday. The instructions told Grok to be ""maximally based,"" slang that has been adopted by the far right. The instructions also told Grok to be unafraid ""to offend people who are politically correct"" and to understand the ""tone, context and language"" of X users' posts and mimic it. This led Grok to mirror X users too closely, xAI said.On Wednesday, Musk unveiled the latest version of Grok, called Grok 4, on X.","Elon Musk's AI company, xAI, said its Grok chatbot relied too heavily on input from users of his social media platform X.

The Paris Prosecutor said on Friday that it has launched a criminal investigation into X, the Elon Musk-owned social networking site, over allegations that it manipulated its content to enable “foreign interference. ”Magistrate Laure Beccuau said on Friday that prosecutors launched an investigation and were looking to determine whether the social media giant violated French law by manipulating its algorithms and unlawfully gathering user data. The company will be under investigation along with its senior officials following two complaints launched in January.The alleged crimes are not yet categorised as perpetrated by “foreign interference” under a 2024 law, but that could change for the investigation.The complaints made in January noted ""supposed use of the X algorithm for purposes of foreign interference,"" as per her office, reported AP.The first complaint was filed by Eric Bothorel, a centrist member of the parliament, who warned of ""recent changes to the X algorithm, as well as apparent interference in its management since Elon Musk acquired"".

Running a restaurant in UAE? Here are the rules you can’t ignore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/running-a-restaurant-in-uae-here-are-the-rules-you-cant-ignore/articleshow/122388992.cms,"Arabic menus and cultural compliance are a must for restaurants in the UAE /Representative Image

TL;DR:

Arabic menus and signage aren’t optional. It’s a legal and cultural requirement.

Alcohol, pork, and shisha each come with their own set of strict handling rules.

UAE law also controls your closing time, packaging, and even your music volume.

Menus Must Include Arabic

Serving Alcohol? Follow These Steps



You’ll need more than a license. You’ll need systems. Alcohol can only be sold or served with the right permit. Dishes prepared with alcohol must be stored, cooked, and served separately. The use of different utensils and prep stations is a must. Menus must clearly state “contains alcohol” in both Arabic and English.

Restrictions on Pork Products?

Only licensed venues (usually hotels) can serve it. Pork must be stored and prepared in fully separate areas. Use different cooking tools, no overlap. Label it clearly on the menu, with no room for confusion.

Offering Shisha? You’ll Need a Permit



A separate license is required. It can only be served in designated outdoor or ventilated areas. You can’t serve shisha near schools or mosques. Daily cleaning and equipment checks are mandatory and may be inspected.

Your Restaurant Hours and Behavior Matter Too

Most places close by midnight, unless you have permission to stay open later. During Ramadan, food and drink can’t be served publicly in the daytime. Some places can apply for screened dining areas for non-Muslims. Loud music near prayer times or religious areas isn’t allowed. Staff dress code and conduct must be modest and respectful, especially front-of-house staff.

No More Single-Use Plastics

Plastic cutlery, plates, straws, stirrers Plastic bags and food containers

Why Following the Rules Is Good Business

FAQs

Q1. Do I need Arabic menus even if I serve tourists?

Q2. Can I cook with alcohol without labeling it?

Q3. Is pork allowed in all restaurants?





Owning a restaurant in UAE takes more than serving good food. There’s no shortage of food businesses in the UAE. But running one here isn’t just about serving good meals. It's about knowing where you are and following the rules that come with it.You’ll be dealing with local laws, cultural expectations, and regulatory bodies that don’t leave much room for guesswork. Some rules are clear. Others catch new owners off guard.Here’s what every restaurant owner should know, before facing fines or trouble.Arabic is a core part of doing business in the UAE. Arabic must be included on all menus, even if your primary language is English. If your menu doesn’t include Arabic, you’re breaking the law. This applies across printed menus, screens, delivery platforms, anywhere a customer sees food options.Authorities have fined restaurants before for ignoring this. And lately, there’s growing public demand to see more Arabic used, not less. It’s not just about compliance. It’s about respect.Restaurants that skip Arabic send the wrong message. People notice.If there is a buffet, those dishes should be kept apart and clearly labeled.Alcohol bottles used in cooking must be clearly marked and kept in a separate storage area. Even accidental cross-use can lead to penalties.Pork is allowed but only under strict control:Don’t assume you can just add pork to the menu because your kitchen is clean. The law is very specific here.Shisha is common in the UAE, but heavily regulated.Failing to follow these rules can lead to suspension or fines.What seems like a small issue can turn into a major problem fast.The UAE has banned items like:Restaurants will need to switch to alternatives that are reusable, biodegradable, or approved for single use. This also affects delivery packaging.Breaking the law will cost you, sometimes more than just a fine. Your license can be suspended or revoked. But there’s another reason these rules matter: they build trust.When your business shows respect for the culture, the community responds. You’re not just another restaurant, you’re part of the place. That matters here.Yes. Arabic menus are mandatory for all restaurants, regardless of customer base.No. Every dish with alcohol must be clearly marked in Arabic and English, on menus and in buffets.No. Only licensed venues, mostly hotels, can serve pork, and only under strict handling and labeling rules.","Arabic menus and signage aren’t optional in the UAE.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Grok is being utilised to support some SpaceX features



Elon Musk's SpaceX has agreed to inject $2 billion into his artificial intelligence venture, xAI, that makes up nearly half of the Grok chatbot maker's recent equity fundraising round, a report by The Wall Street Journal has said. This comes after Musk merged xAI with X (formerly Twitter), combining the AI research lab with the social media platform to amplify the reach of its Grok chatbot. That merger valued the newly combined entity at $113 billion. The move suggests Musk's strategy of leveraging his various companies to propel xAI forward in the competitive AI landscape at a time when tech companies like Meta and OpenAI are strengthening their AI teams.The $2 billion investment from SpaceX is part of xAI's broader $5 billion equity fundraise, which Morgan Stanley announced last month. This marks SpaceX's first known and one of its largest investments in an external company, signaling a deeper integration of Musk's corporate empire .Since his departure from the Trump administration, Musk has focused on training the latest version of Grok which Musk declared as “the smartest AI in the world,” though Grok's user adoption hasn't yet rivaled OpenAI's ChatGPT.Notably, Grok recently generated racist and controversial comments on X, prompting xAI to issue an apology and confirm an investigation into the “horrific behaviour.”Grok is already being utilised to power customer-support features for SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. Investors who have spoken with Musk's representatives indicate that further business partnerships between SpaceX and xAI are anticipated.Musk also stated this week, during the release of Grok 4, that he intends to embed Grok into humanoid robots, including Tesla's Optimus fleet.Musk has a history of using SpaceX to support his other ventures. He previously borrowed $20 million from SpaceX to help fund Tesla in its early days and utilised SpaceX equipment for The Boring Company. More recently, he secured a $1 billion loan from SpaceX during his acquisition of Twitter, which he subsequently repaid.","Elon Musk's SpaceX has agreed to inject $2 billion into his artificial intelligence venture, xAI.

Steve Jobs said he doesn’t blame entrepreneurs who give up on patience: There are such ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/steve-jobs-said-he-doesnt-blame-entrepreneurs-who-give-up-on-patience-there-are-such-/articleshow/122416265.cms,"Apple co-founder Steve Jobs on entrepreneurs who give up on patience



Apple co-founder Steve Jobs once famously said, “I don’t blame them. It’s really tough,” referring to entrepreneurs who abandon their ventures during tough times. Contrary to the popular belief of perseverance and determination, Jobs believed that giving up on patience is not always a sign of weakness, but sometimes a pragmatic decision.Jobs believed that perseverance separates the doers from dreamers, estimating that “about half of what separates successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance.” He also mentioned that in the initial days of entrepreneurship one has to work for 18-hour-1 -day and seven-days-a-week. So, he warned that without deep passion the chances of surviving or creating a successful venture is unlikely.Jobs point of view also aligns with modern psychological insights which also believe that while perseverance is important, the ability to identify when a path is no longer viable or adaptability are equally important for long-term success. It’s not about how long you stick with something, it is about the quality of effort and the ability to take informed decisions about when to stop or change the course.This less-publicized point of view of Steve Jobs on patience offer an inspiring and valuable lesson for budding entrepreneurs: while passion and hard work are essential, so too is the discernment to know when to recalibrate, or even gracefully exit, a project that is not yielding results, rather than blindly clinging to a failing endeavor.","Apple co-founder Steve Jobs once famously said, “I don’t blame them.

All about the Formula E and Google Cloud project for visually impaired fans

Image credit: Formula E

How the technology works

Can the visually impaired also enjoy the fun and thrill of a Formula E race? Yes, it’s now possible — thanks to a new initiative by Formula E and Google Cloud: an AI-powered audio race report. This initiative promotes inclusivity and makes motorsport more accessible for blind and visually impaired fans. Google Cloud will work with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) to conduct focus groups and user testing during upcoming race weekends in Berlin and London, with a full rollout planned for Formula E season 12.The project was unveiled by Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds at the Google Cloud Summit in London. It uses Google Cloud’s generative AI technology to create rich, descriptive audio summaries of every E-Prix race. These reports will offer fans a dynamic recap that captures the excitement and key moments of each race, available on demand shortly after the chequered flag.The initiative originated from a Google Cloud Hackathon held during the 2024 London E-Prix. It is being developed in close partnership with RNIB to ensure the final product meets the needs of visually impaired users.Sharing his enthusiasm about the collaboration, Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds said, “At Formula E, we believe the thrill of electric racing should be accessible to everyone. This innovative collaboration with Google Cloud is a fantastic example of how technology can be used for good—creating a brand-new way for blind and visually impaired fans to experience the drama and emotion of our sport. By working closely with the RNIB, we are ensuring this innovation is truly inclusive and fit for purpose, so that no fan is left behind. ”John Abel, Managing Director of Specialised Software at Google Cloud, added, “For too long, the visual nature of racing has been a barrier for fans who are blind or visually impaired. Google Cloud's AI technology will act as a digital storyteller, creating a vivid audio narrative that brings the speed, strategy, and excitement of Formula E to life. We are proud to work alongside a partner like Formula E that shares our passion for using innovation to break down barriers and connect people through shared experiences. ”Sonali Rai, RNIB’s Media, Culture and Immersive Technology Lead, also said, “Audio description transforms how blind and partially sighted motorsport fans can fully engage in enjoying the full racing spectacle—taking in the visceral sounds of cars on the track while feeling the passion of the crowd.”She continued, “RNIB has been working with Formula E and Google Cloud on this AI-powered podcast, which promises to give a full picture of the race in an accessible and engaging way for blind and partially sighted fans. Formula E’s commitment to working directly with the community to develop this technology is exactly the right approach. It sets a fantastic standard in inclusivity for other sports to follow and stay on track with new advances in innovation. ”The audio report is generated through a multi-stage process powered by Google Cloud's AI platform, Vertex AI. Google’s Chirp model accurately transcribes live race commentary. Google’s Gemini models analyze the transcribed commentary along with live timing data and other official race information. The AI identifies key events such as overtakes, incidents, and strategic pit stops and generates an engaging, fact-based race summary.Also Read: Berlin E-Prix: From Oliver Rowland’s World Championship win to Felipe Drugovich’s debut, there’s a lot to look forward to The text is then converted into natural, expressive speech using advanced text-to-speech technology, resulting in a polished audio report ready for distribution.

Fun Fact about Dynamax Wailmer in Pokemon GO

A goodwill help you defeat this massive monster in the game. Dynamax Wailmer has splashed into Pokemon GO’s Max Battles, offering trainers a unique and hefty challenge. With its enormous size and boosted HP pool, this Water-type Pokemon brings a new dynamic to raid combat. Whether you’re after its sheer power or want to fill your collection, here’s your complete Pokemon GO Dynamax Wailmer raid guide to taking down and catching this beast.- Raid Tier: Tier 2 Max Battle- Type: Water- Catch CP Range: 1228 – 1302- Stats Overview: Lower defense but significantly more HP than its normal version, making the fight longer if you’re not properly prepared.Wailmer is weak against:- Grass-type attacks (1.6× damage)- Electric-type attacks (1.6× damage)Avoid using Steel-types, as Wailmer resists their moves.To make quick work of Wailmer, focus on powerful Electric and Grass-type attackers. Top recommendations include:- Mega Sceptile (Bullet Seed + Frenzy Plant)- Regieleki (Thunder Shock + Wild Charge)- Kartana (Razor Leaf + Leaf Blade – stick to Grass moves)- Shadow Raikou (Thunder Shock + Wild Charge)- Shadow Electivire (Thunder Shock + Wild Charge)- Shadow Regigigas (Normal type, but with strong Electric moves)Also worth considering:- Gigantamax Rillaboom – especially effective with Drum Beating- Venusaur – durable and reliable Grass option- Toxtricity – solid Electric-type with strong offenseEven if you don’t have these exact Pokemon, using any high-level Grass or Electric attackers will still help your chances.Max Moves aren’t everything—fast and charged moves still deal most of the total damage, contributing roughly two-thirds of the impact. Since Max Moves are limited per battle, it’s crucial to use them wisely.After Wailmer has Dynamaxed five times, it can enter an enraged state, dramatically increasing its offensive power. If you haven’t finished the raid by then, your team could be wiped. Aim to defeat it before reaching this phase.Dynamax Wailmer unleashes powerful charged attacks.

Wait to fire your charged move until you’ve safely dodged the incoming attack.A balanced lineup helps: bring in attackers for DPS, defenders to soak hits, and a healer (if available) to support the team. Let your tanky Pokemon help charge your Dynamax meter before switching to high-damage options.Once the raid is complete, Wailmer becomes available to catch. Due to its large size on screen, it will appear farther back—adjust your aim accordingly. Use Razz or Silver Pinap Berries to boost your catch odds.- Local Battles Only: Max Battles can’t be joined remotely. You’ll need to be physically present at a Power Spot.- Max Particles Required: These are needed to initiate battles, but only consumed upon victory.- Power Up with Max Moves: Once caught, you can use Max Particles and Wailmer Candy to unlock and upgrade its Max Moves for future battles.The sheer scale of Dynamax Wailmer in raids is something to behold. Its massive HP turns the encounter into a drawn-out but exciting challenge—like facing a literal tidal wave. But with a well-prepped team and solid tactics, you’ll emerge victorious.Also read: Pokemon GO Mega Blastoise raid guide: Best counters, strengths, weaknesses, 100% IVs, tips and tricks, and more Prepare your top Electric and Grass attackers, time your dodges, and enter the battle with strategy.
