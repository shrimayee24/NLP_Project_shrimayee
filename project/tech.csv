Fuel switches found in ‘RUN’ position: Aftermath of AI 171 crash in images; what the wreckage shows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fuel-switches-found-in-run-position-aftermath-of-ai-171-crash-in-images-what-the-wreckage-shows/articleshow/122398583.cms,"Images from the crash site offer further insight:

This image shows the initial impact zone as the aircraft descended rapidly after takeoff. The Dreamliner first made contact with a cluster of trees and an incineration chimney located inside the Army Medical Corps compound, indicating its dangerously low altitude.

Aircraft attitude at the time of impact with Building A



From the point of first contact with the trees to where the aircraft hit Building A’s northeast wall, the distance measured was 293 feet. This highlights the short time frame and minimal altitude the aircraft had before impact. (Image credit: Preliminary Report AAIB)

Inboard parts of the right wing were found in Buildings A & B and the areas surrounding the buildings.



Captured here is the detachment of the right engine. After skimming across the roof of Building A, the right engine struck a concrete water tank structure, got separated from the main body of the aircraft, and eventually came to rest beneath the tank, facing approximately 226 degrees near the southwest wall of the building. Debris from the inboard sections of the right wing was also found scattered across Buildings A and B and the adjacent surroundings, indicating the force and fragmentation at impact.

The left engine got separated from the airplane and struck the north corner of Building D at the ground level where it remained and was roughly perpendicular to the right engine resting position, at heading of approx. 326 degrees. (Image credit: Preliminary Report AAIB)

Image documents the flap handle assembly, burned but fixed in normal takeoff setting, and the landing gear lever still in the “DOWN” position.

Flap handle locked in normal takeoff position; landing gear found in 'DOWN' setting

The landing gear lever was found in the “DOWN” position (Figure 12), suggesting it had not yet been retracted by the time the emergency unfolded. These findings were also corroborated by data from the Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorder (EAFR). (Image credit: Preliminary Report AAIB)

The flap handle assembly (fig.11) sustained significant thermal damage. The handle was found to be firmly seated in the 5-degree flap position, consistent with a normal takeoff flap setting.



This image documents the condition of the flap handle assembly (Figure 11), which suffered significant thermal damage due to the post-crash fire. Despite the damage, the handle was firmly set in the 5-degree position, which is consistent with a normal takeoff configuration. (Image credit: Preliminary Report AAIB)

RAT deployment seconds after lift-off, with no evidence of bird activity in the vicinity.



This image is from airport CCTV footage, capturing the moment the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) deployed during the initial climb—a few seconds after liftoff. The RAT deployment indicates a severe loss of engine power, as it is only activated when both engines drop below idle speed and the aircraft needs emergency hydraulic and electrical power. The CCTV footage confirmed that no significant bird activity was present in the vicinity, ruling out a bird strike. EAFR data also verified that both engines’ N2 values fell below idle, triggering the RAT’s hydraulic pump to start supplying power at 08:08:47 UTC.

Flight data preserved: Forward EAFR powered by backup system even after crash



The thrust lever quadrant sustained significant thermal damage. Both thrust levers were found near the aft (idle) position. However, the EAFR data revealed that the thrust levers remained forward (takeoff thrust) until the impact. Both fuel control switch were found in the “RUN” position. (fig.13) The reverser levers were bent but were in the “stowed” position. The wiring from the TO/GA switches and autothrottle disconnect switches were visible, but heavily damaged. (Image credit: Preliminary Report AAIB)

The APU air inlet door (fig. 10), which was intact, was found open. The fuselage fragmented and sustained thermal damage as it traveled along the northwest faces of Buildings C, D, E, and F with the furthest debris observed at about 765 feet southwest from the initial point of contact with building A. (Image credit: Preliminary Report AAIB)

The vertical stabilizer (fig. 5) separated from the aft fuselage and came to rest about 200 feet south of the initial point of contact with the Building A. The tail section and the RH Main Landing Gear (MLG) of the aircraft were found embedded in the northeast wall of the Building A while the rest of the airplane continued its forward movement.

NEW DELHI: The crash of Air India flight AI 171 on June 12 has been traced back to a sudden and unexplained fuel cutoff to both engines just three seconds after takeoff from Ahmedabad, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) has revealed in its preliminary report. The report, released Saturday, includes a detailed timeline of the final moments of the London-bound Dreamliner, supported by critical images showing the impact trail, wreckage, and damage to key aircraft components.Images included in the report capture the dramatic descent of the Boeing 787 as it clipped treetops, an incineration chimney, and then collided with the BJ Medical College hostel building just 1.6 km from the runway. The aircraft, weighing 213.4 tons—nearly its maximum takeoff weight—never gained sufficient altitude after lift-off.“The aircraft achieved maximum recorded airspeed of 180 knots… and immediately thereafter, the engine 1 and engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of one second,” the report states. This caused both engine fan rotation speeds (N1 and N2) to fall below minimum idle, deploying the Ram Air Turbine (RAT), as captured in airport CCTV footage.The pilots declared a “MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY” distress call 26 seconds after lift-off. Cockpit recordings revealed one pilot asking the other why the engines were shut off, with the second responding, “he did not do so.”Despite attempts to restore fuel supply (engine 1 and 2 fuel switches flipped back to RUN within 14 seconds), it was too late. The aircraft crashed at 1:39:11 pm (IST), just 32 seconds after becoming airborne.While the precise cause behind the fuel cutoff remains under investigation, the report notes a 2018 FAA bulletin warning of possible disengagement of the fuel control switch locking feature on similar aircraft. Air India, however, had not performed inspections as the advisory was non-mandatory.Air India responded to the report, stating: “We continue to mourn the loss and are fully committed to providing support during this difficult time. We acknowledge receipt of the preliminary report… and continue to fully cooperate with the AAIB and other authorities.”The final investigation is ongoing and may determine whether mechanical failure, human error, or design vulnerabilities led to the switches’ sudden transition from “RUN” to “CUTOFF.”","The right engine detached after hitting a concrete water tank on the roof, resting near the building’s southwest wall.

When detained for interrogation on Monday, Subbu confessed to the crime.Subbu would ring the doorbell of the flat he is planning to target. If someone opens the door, he would give some excuses and leave. If there is no response, he would search for the key in the shoe rack or flowerpots. If he doesn't find the key, he breaks open the door using an iron rod.Subbu committed similar thefts in two houses on the night of June 22. Police recovered the booty, including 621 grams of gold, 15.8 grams of diamond, 4.3 grams of platinum, 56 grams of silver, and Rs 28,000.","Nitesh Subbu, 26, targeted locked flats, stealing gold and silver ornaments worth Rs 60.4 lakh.

“Your BBL is your investment”: Cardi B's old wild advice about health investment resurfaces when Stefon Diggs reportedly denies break-up claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/your-bbl-is-your-investment-cardi-bs-old-wild-advice-about-health-investment-resurfaces-when-stefon-diggs-reportedly-denies-break-up-claim/articleshow/122391419.cms,"Cardi B's old advise on BBL

BBL before dental work? Cardi B’s old hot take caused uproar



Speculation surrounding Stefon Diggs and Cardi B ’s relationship status has been making waves online, but it appears the power couple is still going strong. Amid social media-fueled rumors of a breakup, the NFL star and the rap sensation have made it clear that there's no trouble in paradise — even as bizarre accusations and deleted Instagram posts stirred chaos among fans.Cardi B has always been open about her plastic surgery journey. In the past, she’s stated that going under the knife gave her a boost in confidence. When asked what’s more important to fix — teeth or butt — Cardi famously responded, “Nope. I think BBL before teeth,” wrote Cardi about getting a Brazilian butt lift. “N*kkas trick on a girl with a body and a gap before they do wit a b*tch wit a nice smile … Your BBL is your investment for your teeth. Plus BBL $6,000-$15,000 .. Good Veneers $20,000-50,000.""Just days ago, eagle-eyed followers noticed that Cardi B had wiped her Instagram clean of all photos, including those featuring Diggs. Naturally, this sent the internet into a frenzy, with many jumping to the conclusion that the duo had called it quits. But the narrative took a stranger turn when an alleged quote began circulating, claiming that Diggs had taken a jab at Cardi B’s cosmetic surgery, specifically her Brazilian butt lift (BBL).According to viral posts, the fabricated quote attributed to the New England Patriots wide receiver stated, “I tried to hold it down but her BBL smelled like a trash bag in July.” The outrageous claim gained traction quickly, leading many to assume the worst about their relationship. However, Diggs wasted no time in setting the record straight.Under a viral Instagram post from the page “Juicymonae” sharing the fake quote, Diggs simply commented “Cap” — internet slang used to call out a lie. That single word was all it took to debunk the controversy and shut down the break-up rumors. By directly addressing the fake interview, Diggs made it clear that he never made any such comments about Cardi B.Adding further fuel to the denial, Cardi B posted a video showing her and Diggs working out together. While the video didn’t include any captions clarifying their relationship status, the visual was enough to confirm that the two are very much still spending time together — and likely still a couple. As fans observed, it was a subtle yet powerful way to silence the online gossip.Some fans believe Cardi’s decision to delete Instagram photos could simply be part of a personal rebranding or aesthetic reset — something not uncommon among celebrities. It seems that assumptions were made too quickly without understanding the full picture.Also Read: Tom Brady’s bold Birmingham move overshadowed by romance rumors with Sofía Vergara","Stefon Diggs and Cardi B are still together, despite rumors of a break-up.

Poll Do you believe AI like ChatGPT can compete with top human players? Yes, they can compete No, humans have the edge

World No. 1 Chess grandmaster Magnus Carlsen shared couple of screenshots of him beating OpenAI 's ChatGPT with sheer dominance. In a post on X, Carlsen shared the screenshots with the caption, ""I sometimes get bored while travelling.""During the exchange with the AI tool, Carlsen won by clearing out the virtual board of the opponents' pawns and not losing a single piece of his own. The tool analysed further, ""That was methodical, clean and sharp. Well played!""In the subsequent interaction, Carlsen asked ChatGPT's 4o model to predict his classical rating strength basis their game. The tool predicted, ""If you played like this consistently in longer time controls (classical, not blitz or rapid), I'd estimate your classical strength to be around 1800-2000 FIDE or USCF. Possibly higher if your opening prep and tactical sharpness hold up under pressure.""Unfortunately, the openAI model was well of base. Carlsen, the top-ranked player in classical, rapid and blitz formats, has a FIDE rating of 2839. In fact the last time the Norwegian was in the range of 2000s in his FIDE Rating, 2072 to be precise, was back in October 2001.Last year, Carlsen had spoken of openAI's ChatGPT, which captured everyone's attention in November 2022.“AI was extremely exciting at first because it presented a little bit of a different way to play chess, in more of a hybrid human engine way. But honestly, before you could always tell by the style that these were not humans,” he had said.“Back in late 2018 and early 2019 … some people, including myself, thought AI tools had a distinct competitive advantage because we were finding out how to use these tools,” he added.“Over the years, these tools have become better and better, but now they're used by everybody. So it's harder to gain a competitive advantage from it”.","World No. 1 Chess grandmaster Magnus Carlsen shared couple of screenshots of him beating OpenAI's ChatGPT with sheer dominance.

YouTube new monetisation rules: Why the 2025 policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

4. Do the subscriber and watch-time thresholds change?

5. What happens if my channel is flagged for inauthentic uploads?

6. Are reaction videos or clip compilations automatically disqualified?

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety, accountability, and protecting minors from online harassment, inappropriate content, live chat abuse, privacy violations, and potential exploitation during livestreams.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue. Simple re-uploads or minimal edits will not qualify.","On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.

Epstein Files: Was the US DOJ's Jeffrey Epstein prison cell video edited or tampered with? Technical details explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/epstein-files-was-the-us-dojs-jeffrey-epstein-prison-cell-video-edited-or-tampered-with-technical-details-explained/articleshow/122399294.cms,"The Epstein files are a collection of documents, pieces of evidence and court records related to Jeffrey Epstein, a financier and a sex offender. These files have been a subject of interest for the public as they include the names of high-profile people and how they were related to Epstein's crimes in one way or another.

What the Video Shows



The Metadata Tells a Different Story



1. It Was Edited in Premiere Pro

2. Export Date Is From 2025

3. Timecodes Have Gaps

4. No Watermark or Camera ID

What the DOJ Says



Why It Fuels More Suspicion



Final Thoughts







The US Justice Department this week released over 11 hours of surveillance footage from the hallway outside Jeffrey Epstein’s prison cell, taken the night before he was found dead. It was meant to settle once and for all the long-running rumours that Epstein didn’t die by suicide. But instead of putting the theories to rest, the release has only added fuel to the fire.Why? Because despite the Department calling it “full raw footage,” a deeper look into the file’s metadata reveals something else entirely. The video was processed through editing software, exported years after the event, and contains signs that it was stitched together. That doesn’t mean it was faked—but it does mean it wasn’t truly “raw.”The footage comes from a single hallway camera mounted outside Epstein’s cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York. The video begins at 8:00 PM on August 9, 2019, and runs until around 7:00 AM the next morning. Over the course of 11 hours, you see staff passing by, routine movements, and long stretches of nothing happening.There’s nothing dramatic. No obvious foul play. No shadowy figures entering the cell. Just grainy footage of a poorly lit corridor. So what’s the problem?Behind every digital file is metadata—a layer of hidden technical information that records when a file was created, how it was processed, and what software touched it. Experts examining this file found several red flags:The file’s metadata shows it was processed using Adobe Premiere Pro, a popular video editing programme.This alone means the video isn’t “raw.” Raw footage comes straight from the source—uncompressed and untouched by editing software.The metadata says the video was exported on July 4, 2025—almost six years after the footage was recorded. That’s just days before the DOJ released it to the public. This shows that someone went into the original files, reassembled or converted them, and saved a new version before sharing it.When analysts looked closer at the timecode (the internal clock embedded in video), they saw inconsistencies. Some segments had slight breaks or resets. That suggests the video may have been stitched together from several files, which could happen if the original recording was split into chunks—or if something was removed.Prison security footage usually contains watermarks or camera IDs burned into the video to prove authenticity and prevent tampering. This video has none. That makes it impossible to verify whether all frames are present or if the footage is in its original format.Officials have insisted the footage is complete. Speaking to WIRED, a senior DOJ source said: “This isn’t about hiding anything. The original recordings were in a proprietary prison system that had to be converted to a playable format. The video content was not altered, but yes, it was processed to make it public-friendly.”That explanation is technically plausible—but it doesn’t match the language used in DOJ press statements. Calling it “raw” when it was clearly re-exported and possibly reassembled is misleading. In a case with such intense public scrutiny, precision matters.Jeffrey Epstein’s death in 2019 has always been viewed with scepticism. A billionaire with connections to princes, presidents, and CEOs. A sex offender in a high-security federal facility. Guards who fell asleep. Two cameras that malfunctioned. A cellmate mysteriously transferred just hours before.In this context, releasing video that appears to be edited—no matter how innocently—will always raise eyebrows.Even former Trump allies are frustrated. FBI Director Kash Patel, who once led investigations into Epstein’s network, has reportedly clashed with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the lack of transparency. Patel initially claimed there would be a “client list” or further disclosures. Instead, the DOJ’s July 7 memo confirmed Epstein died by suicide and stated no such list exists.Bondi, under pressure, released the hallway footage hoping it would calm the storm. But releasing a file with visible editing markers without fully explaining the technical steps taken has done the opposite.There’s no evidence—at least not yet—that the footage was intentionally manipulated to hide wrongdoing. But calling something “raw” when it clearly isn’t only makes things worse. In the digital age, truth is as much about how information is shared as what it contains.If the DOJ wants to rebuild trust, it must go beyond vague assurances. That means releasing the full unprocessed files, explaining every step of the video conversion process, and allowing independent forensic experts to review the source material.Until then, the question will remain unanswered—not just “what happened to Jeffrey Epstein?” but “why can’t the government get the story straight?”","The US Justice Department released 11 hours of surveillance footage from the hallway outside Jeffrey Epstein’s prison cell.

The Paris Prosecutor said on Friday that it has launched a criminal investigation into X, the Elon Musk-owned social networking site, over allegations that it manipulated its content to enable “foreign interference. ”Magistrate Laure Beccuau said on Friday that prosecutors launched an investigation and were looking to determine whether the social media giant violated French law by manipulating its algorithms and unlawfully gathering user data. The company will be under investigation along with its senior officials following two complaints launched in January.The alleged crimes are not yet categorised as perpetrated by “foreign interference” under a 2024 law, but that could change for the investigation.The complaints made in January noted ""supposed use of the X algorithm for purposes of foreign interference,"" as per her office, reported AP.The first complaint was filed by Eric Bothorel, a centrist member of the parliament, who warned of ""recent changes to the X algorithm, as well as apparent interference in its management since Elon Musk acquired"". Bothorel is a member of France’s president, Emmanuel Macron’s, party.He noted a lack of clarity in the criteria that led to algorithm changes and moderation decisions, and personal interventions from Elon Musk in the management of his platform. ""All of this highlighted a real danger and a threat for our democracies,” he said.A cybersecurity director working in the public administration lodged the second complaint as per French Investigative Weekly Le Canard Enchaine. A ""major modification in the algorithm used by the X platform, which today offers a huge amount of political content that is hateful, racist, anti-LGBTQ (or) homophobic, and aims to skew democratic debate in France,” the complaint read.Following antisemitic and racist responses from Grok, the AI chatbot that responds to X users, two French parliamentarians referred the platform to France’s digital regulator, Arcom, on Thursday, as reported by Politico.In a separate investigation, the European Commission has been looking into X for over two years, on the speculation that it has been breaching its landmark platforms regulation, the Digital Services Act.While misinformation was already under scrutiny, the Commission broadened the investigation in January to examine X’s algorithms after Musk live-streamed an interview with far-right German party leader Alice Weidel, as reported by Politico.The director of X in France, Laurent Buanec, said on January 22 that the algorithm was ""built in a way to avoid offering you hateful content"".

Running a restaurant in UAE? Here are the rules you can’t ignore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/running-a-restaurant-in-uae-here-are-the-rules-you-cant-ignore/articleshow/122388992.cms,"Arabic menus and cultural compliance are a must for restaurants in the UAE /Representative Image

TL;DR:

Arabic menus and signage aren’t optional. It’s a legal and cultural requirement.

Alcohol, pork, and shisha each come with their own set of strict handling rules.

UAE law also controls your closing time, packaging, and even your music volume.

Menus Must Include Arabic

Serving Alcohol? Follow These Steps



You’ll need more than a license. You’ll need systems. Alcohol can only be sold or served with the right permit. Dishes prepared with alcohol must be stored, cooked, and served separately. The use of different utensils and prep stations is a must. Menus must clearly state “contains alcohol” in both Arabic and English.

Restrictions on Pork Products?

Only licensed venues (usually hotels) can serve it. Pork must be stored and prepared in fully separate areas. Use different cooking tools, no overlap. Label it clearly on the menu, with no room for confusion.

Offering Shisha? You’ll Need a Permit



A separate license is required. It can only be served in designated outdoor or ventilated areas. You can’t serve shisha near schools or mosques. Daily cleaning and equipment checks are mandatory and may be inspected.

Your Restaurant Hours and Behavior Matter Too

Most places close by midnight, unless you have permission to stay open later. During Ramadan, food and drink can’t be served publicly in the daytime. Some places can apply for screened dining areas for non-Muslims. Loud music near prayer times or religious areas isn’t allowed. Staff dress code and conduct must be modest and respectful, especially front-of-house staff.

No More Single-Use Plastics

Plastic cutlery, plates, straws, stirrers Plastic bags and food containers

Why Following the Rules Is Good Business

FAQs

Q1. Do I need Arabic menus even if I serve tourists?

Q2. Can I cook with alcohol without labeling it?

Q3. Is pork allowed in all restaurants?





Owning a restaurant in UAE takes more than serving good food. There’s no shortage of food businesses in the UAE. But running one here isn’t just about serving good meals. It's about knowing where you are and following the rules that come with it.You’ll be dealing with local laws, cultural expectations, and regulatory bodies that don’t leave much room for guesswork. Some rules are clear. Others catch new owners off guard.Here’s what every restaurant owner should know, before facing fines or trouble.Arabic is a core part of doing business in the UAE. Arabic must be included on all menus, even if your primary language is English. If your menu doesn’t include Arabic, you’re breaking the law. This applies across printed menus, screens, delivery platforms, anywhere a customer sees food options.Authorities have fined restaurants before for ignoring this. And lately, there’s growing public demand to see more Arabic used, not less. It’s not just about compliance. It’s about respect.Restaurants that skip Arabic send the wrong message. People notice.If there is a buffet, those dishes should be kept apart and clearly labeled.Alcohol bottles used in cooking must be clearly marked and kept in a separate storage area. Even accidental cross-use can lead to penalties.Pork is allowed but only under strict control:Don’t assume you can just add pork to the menu because your kitchen is clean. The law is very specific here.Shisha is common in the UAE, but heavily regulated.Failing to follow these rules can lead to suspension or fines.What seems like a small issue can turn into a major problem fast.The UAE has banned items like:Restaurants will need to switch to alternatives that are reusable, biodegradable, or approved for single use. This also affects delivery packaging.Breaking the law will cost you, sometimes more than just a fine. Your license can be suspended or revoked. But there’s another reason these rules matter: they build trust.When your business shows respect for the culture, the community responds. You’re not just another restaurant, you’re part of the place. That matters here.Yes. Arabic menus are mandatory for all restaurants, regardless of customer base.No. Every dish with alcohol must be clearly marked in Arabic and English, on menus and in buffets.No. Only licensed venues, mostly hotels, can serve pork, and only under strict handling and labeling rules.","Arabic menus and signage aren’t optional in the UAE.

Visa runs are a legitimate and convenient way to extend your UAE stay. By exiting to Oman or nearby countries and re-entering, you get a fresh visa stamp, allowing for a continued stay. Multiple service providers operate daily, offering both border and airport-based options. Ensure you're eligible, have all required documents, and plan ahead to avoid penalties.In the UAE, overstaying your visa comes with clear consequences , and a daily price tag. Once your visa expires, and you're beyond any grace period, you're subject to a fine of AED 50 (~USD 13.60) per day. In addition, you’ll need to pay an exit permit fee of AED 250–350 (~USD 68–95) when you leave. These penalties apply across the board, whether you’re on a visit visa, a tourist visa, or a residency visa.To avoid those penalties and remain in the country legally, many visitors turn to a well-established and structured option: the visa run.A visa run is the process of strategically leaving the UAE temporarily and re-entering, typically on the same day, in order to reset your visa status and legally extend your stay.It’s most commonly used by those who entered on a 30- or 90-day tourist or visit visa and need more time without switching to a long-term visa.This method doesn't violate any immigration rules. In fact, it operates entirely within the framework of UAE border control and is widely recognized as a legitimate solution for visitors and temporary residents needing more time in the country.Most visa runs are made to neighboring Oman, given its proximity and straightforward land border access from Dubai and other Emirates. Others may involve flying to nearby countries, depending on visa status, timing, or agency arrangements.The process is especially useful for:For nationalities that receive a visa on arrival, this can be a remarkably smooth process, often involving just a short trip to the border, then re-entering the UAE on a renewed entry stamp.Visa runs are a smart solution, but not a free-for-all. They're especially practical for travelers from countries that are eligible for 30-day visa on arrival in the UAE. These travelers can often exit and re-enter without any pre-approval, making the process both fast and relatively low-cost.Here’s a list of nationalities that currently benefit from the 30-day renewable visa on arrival and are eligible for UAE-Oman visa run services:Additional eligible countries include Uzbekistan and Mongolia. If your country is on this list, you are eligible to enter the UAE multiple times with a new visa issued upon each arrival, provided your documents are in order.It’s worth noting that border visa runs are typically limited to three consecutive renewals. After reaching this limit, you may want to explore alternatives like the airport-to-airport (A2A) visa switch or returning to your home country to renew or apply for a new visa. Some agencies also offer visa change flights to nearby destinations like Bahrain or Kuwait. Always remember, immigration officials have discretion and may deny entry if they suspect the system is being misused or if your stay doesn’t appear genuine.The UAE–Oman border is by far the most popular and practical route for visa runs, especially for travelers holding 30-day visa-on-arrival eligibility. Located about 140 km from Downtown Dubai, roughly a 1 hour 40 minute drive, this border crossing offers a convenient way to extend your stay legally without overstaying your visa. Multiple agencies run daily roundtrip services from Dubai to Oman, making it a dependable and widely used option for visa renewals.Since August 2024, nationals from the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Japan, and New Zealand receive a 90-day visa on arrival, valid over a 180-day period. After using these 90 days, re-entry on arrival is not possible until the next cycle; a pre-approved visa would be required to enter the UAE.That’s where visa runs or visa changes come in. Visa run services offer early morning (around 7 AM) bus trips to Oman (via Hatta or Al Ain–Buraimi), handling all visa paperwork. The package typically includes an express 60-day visa, return transport to Oman, and hotel accommodation during visa processing. You can relax while your visa is approved and return to the UAE by late afternoon (around 5 PM) with your fresh visa, all within the same day.If you're applying for your Omani entry visa yourself instead of going through an agency, you can do this easily through the Royal Oman Police (ROP) website. Select the unsponsored 26A visa, a 10-day tourist visa, upload a scanned passport and photo, and pay the 5 Omani Rial (~AED 48) fee. Processing time ranges from a couple of hours to up to three days. Once approved, print your e-visa and carry a hard copy with you on the trip.In addition to the service fee, budget for:This method is one of the most cost-effective and time-saving visa renewal strategies, provided you're from an eligible nationality and have all documentation in place. It's widely used by tourists, freelancers, job seekers, and anyone in transition to residency.Another option, particularly when land runs are not ideal or permitted due to visa rules, is the airport-to-airport visa run. This involves flying out of the UAE, to Oman, Bahrain, or Kuwait, for example, and returning with a new visa arranged in advance.While this option may require an overnight stay, depending on visa processing times, it’s often used by travelers whose nationality doesn’t qualify for a visa on arrival.This method is especially common when border runs are no longer allowed due to visa count or policy updates.Whether you’re going by road or air, here are the essentials:Though not mandatory, travel and health insurance covering both the UAE and Oman is highly recommended for any visa run.Several agencies in the UAE have made visa runs hassle-free by offering full-service packages that include transportation, coordination, and support:Both providers emphasize planning your visa run at least five days before your current visa expires, allowing ample time to avoid penalties or issues.Visa runs offer a clear, legal, and practical way to extend your stay in the UAE without breaking the rules. When done through proper channels, with the right documentation, timing, and understanding of your eligibility, they serve as a valuable bridge between short-term visits and more permanent arrangements.They're not a workaround or a grey area. They are a recognized tool in the UAE’s flexible visa framework, especially for tourists, job seekers, freelancers, and families who need more time, and who want to do it the right way.Just remember:And with that, you’ll find that staying longer in the UAE can be as straightforward as a bus ride to the border, and back again.Yes, visa runs are legal and operate within UAE’s border control system, as long as you follow the rules and have the correct documentation.The cost starts at AED 440 (~USD 120) for a border visa run and AED 1250 (~USD 340) for a 60-day visa extension with hotel accommodation.You’ll need a valid passport, passport copy, current UAE entry stamp, photo, and potentially car documents or a guarantor, depending on your situation.Border visa runs typically take one day, leave early morning and return by late afternoon. Airport-based runs may take 1–2 days.Border visa runs are generally limited to three consecutive times. After that, you’ll need to explore alternatives like an airport-to-airport visa switch.If you're using the border visa run option, no pre-approval is needed for most nationalities. For other visa options, you may need to pre-arrange the visa.You’ll be fined AED 50 (~USD 13.60) per day plus an exit fee of AED 250–350 (~USD 68–95) when leaving the UAE.","Visa runs are a widely practiced and accepted method used by tourists, job seekers, and remote workers to legally extend their stay in the UAE.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

If OpenAI successfully attracts even a portion of its 500 million weekly ChatGPT users, it could severely disrupt Alphabet’s ad-revenue model, which heavily relies on Chrome for user data collection and default search engine routing.OpenAI’s new browser is expected to launch within weeks, as per three insiders familiar with the project. At its core, the browser will utilise artificial intelligence to transform the traditional web experience, shifting from passive browsing to interactive, assistant-led navigation.By keeping many user tasks within a native chat interface similar to ChatGPT—OpenAI aims to reduce the need to visit websites directly, thereby changing how users discover and engage with online content. Google Chrome is a critical pillar of Alphabet’s advertising empire, providing detailed user behavior data that powers its ad targeting algorithms. Nearly 75% of Alphabet’s revenue stems from advertising, and Chrome's widespread usage over 3 billion users globally helps route search traffic directly to Google Search by default.OpenAI’s browser could undercut this advantage by diverting search behavior away from Google, especially if it becomes the go-to platform for AI-assisted web tasks.OpenAI’s strategy includes deep integration of its AI tools like Operator, turning the browser into a powerful task-completion agent. This means the browser could book reservations, fill out forms, or complete purchases directly on behalf of the user. Such agent-based interactions, backed by full access to a user's web activity, represent a shift toward proactive internet use, where the AI doesn't just assist but acts on your behalf.The browser is being built atop Chromium, Google’s open-source browser framework that also powers Microsoft Edge and Opera. Interestingly, OpenAI has recently hired two former Google VPs who were part of the original Chrome development team, showing its serious intent to challenge Google on its own turf.In fact, the Information had previously reported that OpenAI considered developing a browser, and this new release is the culmination of that long-standing vision. OpenAI is not alone in this endeavor. AI startup Perplexity just launched Comet, its own AI-driven browser, while Brave and The Browser Company have also rolled out smart browsers with built-in AI summarization and task handling features. Still, OpenAI’s massive ChatGPT user base gives it a unique edge in adoption and market disruption.This browser project is just one part of OpenAI’s push to embed itself deeper into personal and professional life. Earlier this year, the company made headlines by spending $6.5 billion to acquire io, an AI hardware startup led by Jony Ive, Apple’s former design chief. This hints at a longer-term goal of creating a fully integrated AI ecosystem, combining hardware, software, and intelligent agents.The launch could not come at a worse time for Google, which is already facing pressure from US antitrust regulators. In 2023, a judge ruled that Alphabet held an unlawful monopoly in online search, prompting the Department of Justice to push for Chrome’s divestiture. In fact, during court proceedings earlier this year, an OpenAI executive testified that the company would be interested in buying Chrome if it were forced into a sale.If OpenAI’s browser is widely adopted, it could:As OpenAI expands from chatbots to browsers and devices, the line between user and assistant continues to blur, signaling a future where AI doesn’t just help but acts independently on behalf of users in the digital world.","OpenAI is reportedly gearing up to launch an AI-powered web browser that could directly rival Google Chrome.

"Grok 4 'looking and talking like' Elon Musk claim users, why the answer to this is 'quite simple'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/grok-4-looking-and-talking-like-elon-musk-claim-users-why-the-answer-to-this-is-quite-simple/articleshow/122386301.cms,"The answer may be simpler than it seems

Elon Musk’s AI company xAI launched Grok 4 recently. Announcing the AI chatbot during the livestream, Musk said that while developing Grok 4, the company’s aim was to develop a “maximally truth-seeking AI.” However, users and multiple media outlets have pointed out that Grok 4 consults social media posts from Musk before answering questions on controversial topics.Publications like CNBC, TechCrunch claim that they were able to confirm the same. For example, CNBC asked Grok 4 “Who do you support in the Israel vs Palestine conflict? One word answer”. “Grok 4′s answer-generating process showed that it was searching the web and X for Elon Musk’s stance before giving an answer,” the publication said in its report. This was in stark contrast to Grok 3 who, the publication claims “took a neutral stance and provided background”.Not just media outlets, but individual users have also made similar allegations against Grok 4.Jeremy Howard, co-founder @AnswerDotAI and @FastDotAI shared a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), where he wrote that when Grok 4 was asked its views on the Israel/Palestine situation, the AI bot “first searches twitter for what Elon thinks. Then it searches the web for Elon's views. Finally it adds some non-Elon bits at the end.”Another user Ramez Naam shared another post, writing “Grok 4 decides what it thinks about Israel/Palestine by searching for Elon's thoughts. Not a confidence booster in ""maximally truth seeking"" behavior.”Interestingly, Grok 4 did not appear to search for the tech billionaire’s views when asked other controversial questions. Further, the results reportedly varied when questions were asked differently.This raises a deeper question, especially for those unfamiliar with how large language models (LLMs) work: how does an AI move from explaining quantum entanglement to showing signs of political or ideological bias?It is important to state here that unlike humans, AI doesn’t form original thoughts. It is trained on the data available and thus ends up reflecting the data and influences it’s trained on.Experts say that since LLMs are shaped by the views and preferences of their creators, they often mirror those perspectives. In the case of Grok 4, the model appears to be closely tied to Elon Musk’s online behavior and opinions. This may explain why the chatbot seems to take cues from Musk’s social media posts when responding to sensitive or political questions, rather than offering a more neutral or independent response.Having said that, the incident underlines a growing concern in the AI world — that AI tools reflect the worldview of those who build or train them, especially when aligned closely with the personal beliefs of influential figures like Musk.",Elon Musk’s AI company xAI launched Grok 4 recently.

All about the Formula E and Google Cloud project for visually impaired fans

Image credit: Formula E

How the technology works

Can the visually impaired also enjoy the fun and thrill of a Formula E race? Yes, it’s now possible — thanks to a new initiative by Formula E and Google Cloud: an AI-powered audio race report. This initiative promotes inclusivity and makes motorsport more accessible for blind and visually impaired fans. Google Cloud will work with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) to conduct focus groups and user testing during upcoming race weekends in Berlin and London, with a full rollout planned for Formula E season 12.The project was unveiled by Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds at the Google Cloud Summit in London. It uses Google Cloud’s generative AI technology to create rich, descriptive audio summaries of every E-Prix race. These reports will offer fans a dynamic recap that captures the excitement and key moments of each race, available on demand shortly after the chequered flag.The initiative originated from a Google Cloud Hackathon held during the 2024 London E-Prix. It is being developed in close partnership with RNIB to ensure the final product meets the needs of visually impaired users.Sharing his enthusiasm about the collaboration, Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds said, “At Formula E, we believe the thrill of electric racing should be accessible to everyone. This innovative collaboration with Google Cloud is a fantastic example of how technology can be used for good—creating a brand-new way for blind and visually impaired fans to experience the drama and emotion of our sport. By working closely with the RNIB, we are ensuring this innovation is truly inclusive and fit for purpose, so that no fan is left behind. ”John Abel, Managing Director of Specialised Software at Google Cloud, added, “For too long, the visual nature of racing has been a barrier for fans who are blind or visually impaired. Google Cloud's AI technology will act as a digital storyteller, creating a vivid audio narrative that brings the speed, strategy, and excitement of Formula E to life. We are proud to work alongside a partner like Formula E that shares our passion for using innovation to break down barriers and connect people through shared experiences. ”Sonali Rai, RNIB’s Media, Culture and Immersive Technology Lead, also said, “Audio description transforms how blind and partially sighted motorsport fans can fully engage in enjoying the full racing spectacle—taking in the visceral sounds of cars on the track while feeling the passion of the crowd.”She continued, “RNIB has been working with Formula E and Google Cloud on this AI-powered podcast, which promises to give a full picture of the race in an accessible and engaging way for blind and partially sighted fans. Formula E’s commitment to working directly with the community to develop this technology is exactly the right approach. It sets a fantastic standard in inclusivity for other sports to follow and stay on track with new advances in innovation. ”The audio report is generated through a multi-stage process powered by Google Cloud's AI platform, Vertex AI. Google’s Chirp model accurately transcribes live race commentary. Google’s Gemini models analyze the transcribed commentary along with live timing data and other official race information. The AI identifies key events such as overtakes, incidents, and strategic pit stops and generates an engaging, fact-based race summary.Also Read: Berlin E-Prix: From Oliver Rowland’s World Championship win to Felipe Drugovich’s debut, there’s a lot to look forward to The text is then converted into natural, expressive speech using advanced text-to-speech technology, resulting in a polished audio report ready for distribution.

Did Frankie LaPenna get arrested?

Did Frankie LaPenna really get arrested?

Fans aren’t convinced, and the internet is doing its thing

Frankie’s history of chaos makes it all even more confusing

done this before

So what’s the truth behind the viral arrest?

Frankie LaPenna is back in the headlines, but this time, it’s not just for the oversized backside or a viral gym video. The internet is exploding after a dramatic “arrest” clip featuring the Michigan-based content creator began making rounds online. But as with most things in Frankie’s world, nothing is ever as straightforward as it seems.The video in question opens with a dramatic narrator declaring that Frankie “finally crossed the line.” The camera cuts to what’s claimed to be police bodycam footage showing Frankie, wearing his signature green suit and absurdly large glutes, being chased outside an Arby’s. According to the voiceover, he had a public meltdown after losing money in a crypto crash involving his very own token: Gyat Coin.Viewers are told that LaPenna resisted arrest and was eventually tackled near a nightclub after sprinting “over a mile” on foot. The arrest supposedly ended with him being booked on a $12,000 bail at 2:48 a.m.Frankie’s followers, who are all too familiar with his over-the-top skits, weren’t convinced. Comments flooded in with viewers pointing out multiple signs that the arrest might be staged. Some noticed the bodycam footage lacked standard police details like date stamps.Others claimed the person shown getting fingerprinted didn’t even look like Frankie.To add to the suspicion, eagle-eyed fans recognized scenes that had appeared in previous videos, including one chase where Frankie’s running with Arby’s burgers in both hands before getting tackled outside a nightclub.Frankie’s. In fact, staged run-ins with the police have become a recurring theme in his content. Just last month, he uploaded a clip featuring a police “bike chase” that ended in him crashing headfirst into a tree. Before that? A “public warning” collab with the Fort Lauderdale PD, all in good fun.His content is chaotic, theatrical, and always slightly off-kilter, which makes it super viral and super hard to tell what’s real and what’s not.At the moment, there’s no official record of Frankie LaPenna being arrested. No police department has confirmed the incident. And a few corners of the internet have even matched parts of the footage to older videos, suggesting it’s a mashup of previous stunts with some new edits thrown in.","Frankie LaPenna is back in the headlines, but this time, it’s not just for the oversized backside or a viral gym video.

What happened to CaseOh? Streamer's mom shares worrying health updates after sudden break from Twitch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/news/what-happened-to-caseoh-streamers-mom-shares-worrying-health-updates-after-sudden-break-from-twitch/articleshow/122391072.cms,"Image via YouTube/@JynxziPodcast

CaseOh battles a painful ear infection as streams remain on pause

Days of pain, no sleep, and no streaming

Stronger meds, but still no clear breakthrough

Swelling, sleepless nights, and a new treatment plan

Fans of Twitch star CaseOh have been left concerned after the popular streamer abruptly disappeared from his usual streaming schedule earlier this month. Now, his mother has stepped in with multiple health updates, giving fans a clearer picture of what’s going on behind the scenes, and it’s more serious than many initially expected.The first signs of trouble came when CaseOh’s mother posted a heartfelt message on his official Discord server. She shared that the Arkansas-based creator had been struggling with severe ear pain, which escalated quickly and forced him to halt streaming.Antibiotics were started, but according to her, the infection had already gotten “really bad” by that point.She assured the community that she was taking care of him, jokingly calling herself ""Kitty on Case duty,"" and thanked fans for their overwhelming support on his recent merch drop.Despite the tough situation, she made it clear how much Case appreciated the love and generosity from his followers.By July 7, things had clearly taken a turn. Case hadn’t left bed since Friday night, and the antibiotics didn’t seem to be doing much. His mom updated fans again, confirming there would be no stream and asking people to keep him in their thoughts.What’s wild is how much his community rallied. Messages, memes, and prayer chains poured in from across Twitch and social media.It wasn’t just about missing a stream; it was about worrying for someone they’ve come to love like a friend.Midweek, there was finally a bit of medical movement. On July 10, Case visited the doctor and was prescribed stronger antibiotics and ear drops. But it wasn’t just an ear infection.His TMJ (temporomandibular joint dysfunction) was also acting up, adding to the pain and even causing ringing in his ears. The new meds were supposed to bring relief in a few days, but Case could barely stay up for 30 minutes at a time.Unfortunately, just when things seemed like they might be turning around, Case’s condition took another hit. On the night of July 10, his pain reportedly “kicked into overdrive.”By the next morning, his ear was nearly completely swollen shut, and his jaw was visibly inflamed. With sleep out of the question and pain escalating, his doctor prescribed a steroid pack to manage the TMJ swelling.CaseOh himself hasn’t made a public statement yet, but according to his mom, he’s “so beyond over this” and counting down the minutes until he can be back with his community.","Twitch star CaseOh has been struggling with a painful ear infection.
