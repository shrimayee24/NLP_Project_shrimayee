"Google has ended support for this Android operating system, here’s how users will be affected",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-has-ended-support-for-this-android-operating-system-heres-how-users-will-be-affected/articleshow/111697324.cms,"Google has discontinued Play Service updates for Android Lollipop , ending a decade of support from the app marketplace. This decision affects both Android 5.0 and 5.1, which last received a security update in March 2018. Play Services updates differ from security updates as they provide new APIs, security fixes, and compatibility features with the latest Play Store apps.The cessation of these updates means that compatibility with certain Play Store apps may break shortly for Lollipop smartphones.As of October 1, 2023, Android 13, 12, and 11 users accounted for almost 60% of the entire Android user base. Android 11, released in 2020, is the second most popular version with a 21.6% share. In contrast, Android Lollipop, which was released in 2014, accounted for less than 1% of Android phone owners in October. The end of Play Services support marks the final stage of Lollipop's decline, following the end of official updates several years ago.This move places Android Lollipop in the same category as Android 4.4 KitKat, which saw its final Play Services updates in July 2023, around 10 years after its release. KitKat's last security update was six years before its Play Services support ended. Following Lollipop, Android Marshmallow is expected to be the next version to lose Play Services support.Currently, Android smartphones receive around seven years of promised security updates, a significant improvement over the four years provided for Lollipop, KitKat, and earlier versions. The Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, for instance, are guaranteed Android OS and security updates until October 2030. The Google Pixel 8a, launched this year, will receive updates until 2031.With the end of Play Services updates for Lollipop, users will face potential compatibility issues with newer apps, signalling a shift towards modernising the Android ecosystem and encouraging users to upgrade to newer devices and software versions.","Google has discontinued Play Service updates for Android Lollipop.

"Shaping Our AI Future: Madhumita Murgia on Agency, Ethics, and Resistance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/shaping-our-ai-future-madhumita-murgia-on-agency-ethics-and-resistance/articleshow/111693124.cms,"TOI Bookmark Interview With Madhumita Murgia

Excerpts from an interview:Q: Can you tell us about what Code Dependent is about?A: I've been writing about tech since 2012. And when I started off, it was all about the disruption and the innovation that tech entrepreneurs bring to society and how it's really changed the way that we live, the way we work, the way we interact with each other over the last decade or so.I've been very optimistic about tech entrepreneurship so for me, the obvious thing would have been to write a book about the sort of opportunities of AI and the hugely positive ways it might influence and change our lives. But, in the decade that I have been reporting on, really the impact of technology on business, on society, I started to notice a lot of darker undercurrents. And I started writing this more than two years ago. So this was prior to the whole ChatGPT kind of explosion. But I could already see how AI had seeped into our lives in these very invisible ways, but very powerful ways, like recommendation systems on social media, or telling us what to listen to on Spotify, or what to watch on Netflix or Amazon Prime Video and so on. And so I wanted to understand how is it changing lives around the world today. And what does that tell us about our future? So I went looking for human stories around the world, across nine countries that I've featured in my book. And through each of these stories of ordinary people and their interactions with AI, I've tried to explore the ripple effects and the consequences of automation on our lives and try and help us to grapple with what our world might look like as it becomes increasingly automated.Q: What is interesting is that you have these case studies, nine countries, whether it is to the scrubbing teams in Africa, to the data mining which is happening in other countries, but there is a sinister edge to it all, which is very worrying.A: When I started out, the book was about finding stories of all kinds, not necessarily leaders of companies building AI products. I think there's so much focus on the other side of the coin, which is the rest of us, and how we experience technology, how we use it and how it's going to change the way we live. Through my stories, I discovered that there were a lot of unintended harms, and a lot of the consequences that I was finding were the opposite of what was intended when these systems were rolled out. I can give you an example. I interviewed a single mother in Amsterdam called Diana. She has two young sons who, at the time of this encounter, were 14 and 16, or 14 and 15. And the Amsterdam govt had created an algorithm, a predictive system, to figure out which young people would go on to commit serious crimes. And her two boys had ended up on this list. One list was for children who had already committed crimes, and they were predicted to commit even worse crimes in future. And the other one was for mostly brothers and siblings of these children who had, in some cases, never even committed a crime. And the goal was not to imprison them in advance but to help these families and to prevent those crimes from occurring. But in practice, it really tore apart these families. It made the parents feel that they had done something wrong. Many of these were single mothers who felt that their children would be taken away from them. And so it ended up having the opposite effect from what was hoped. And this comes up again and again when we try and implement automation into very sensitive parts of our society and daily life. So I think, yes, it did end up being darker and more sinister than even I had expected. But I think that's the reality of how things are today. And I hope that, for me, it's about sending a message saying, so what are we going to do about it? If this is how things are today, how can we change this story? How can we participate and shape it to be a brighter future?Listen to the interview here:Q: A lot of those who have been born in this digital age think that any tool which comes their way is acceptable and accessible can be adopted.A: That's why I kind of chose to tell my story through the lens of people. My hope is that we won't, even a generation younger than me won't sleepwalk into a world where a few companies control the sort of automation of so much of our society, from entertainment to dating, to the way we learn at school and to the relationship with our doctors, with our govt. I think it's really important for us to have agency in this discussion because it's happening now.Q. You can have agency if you recognise you have free will and you have a right. What do you do when you seem to believe that this is the world?A: I think we as humans tend to have this automation bias, which is that if it's a machine that hands out a decision or tells you an answer, you tend to trust it, because somehow we are hardwired into believing that computers are more accurate, more efficient than us. And this has been transferred into our relationship with AI. And I think, for me, a huge part of what I hope to educate and sort of bring to people's awareness who read my book, but also my reporting more broadly, is that that isn't how AI works. Let's take self-driving cars as an example, which require AI to run. No matter how many thousands of hours these cameras have racked up driving around and trying to gather data and predict, we still haven't managed to predict every single edge case. This is why these cars end up having accidents. It's very difficult to predict human behaviour in particular, because it's chaotic and it doesn't follow definitive patterns. And we're trying to bring AI into these domains, into human creativity, like writing and making art and movies, but also in deciding who should get bail or who should be given a govt welfare benefit and things like that. We should always have human accountability for these systems, and we shouldn't be treating them like calculators that have the answers.Q: How is this over-reliance on digital going to impact human society in the long run?A: We forget that behind these systems are just a few companies from currently a small corner of the world, which is the west coast of the US. And these are the puppet-masters behind these systems. They collect the data that we are giving to these systems by talking to them, writing, uploading documents and so on. And ultimately they are profit-making entities. When you are interacting with a system that's going to talk to you and tell you you should do this, or this is an interesting thing, you should buy or read or kind of influence your thinking through what it says, then it's very easy for advertisers to manipulate you because they kind of understand the ways that you think and the ways that you speak.Q. It parallels the kind of imperialistic ways of conquering the physical world in the 19th century, during the first industrial revolution.A: I look at examples of Western companies coming, say, to India to collect health data, using Asha workers as data collectors from the front lines, but never really reporting back what they are doing with that data. This concept of data colonialism , you start to see that these companies pop up all over the world supporting govts and becoming the infrastructure that govts rely on or hospitals rely on. They have moved far past just being consumer product companies, similar to in the ways that the East India Company grew to be much more than just a corporation.Q: Collective will and energy can push back.A: The entire final third of my book is actually looking at resistors and people who are fighting back against a faceless algorithm or a boss who's just a computer software. You have collectives, you have unions in Latin America, in Africa and in Europe and many other parts of the world for gig workers who are fighting back. I talk about Maya Wang, who's a human rights activist in China who's fighting back against the Communist Party, and finding a way to break through the tyranny there in many ways, even though she's just one person in the face of it. And that, I think, is what will help us to come together and decide, you know, what are our lines in the sand? What's okay to have automation? And we need to speak up now because it's being rolled out.","Madhumita Murgia has been writing about tech since 2012.

Ranging from 300 to 900, a higher score indicates a stronger likelihood of loan approval. Banks and financial institutions use this score to assess the risk associated with lending money.1. Go to the official CIBIL website and click on 'Personal CIBIL score,' then 'Get Your Free CIBIL score.' Follow the link provided and fill in all the required details.2. If you don’t have a PAN Card, you can use an alternative identification such as Passport, Voter ID, Driver’s License, or Ration Card. Enter the number of the chosen ID.3. Provide your date of birth, PIN code, and select your state. Finally, enter your mobile number and click on ‘Accept and Continue’.4. Authenticate your identity by entering the OTP (One-Time Password) delivered to your mobile device on the next screen. Click 'Continue' to proceed.5.

Click on ‘Go to Dashboard’ to access and view your CIBIL score.The factors influencing the new CIBIL score, as stated on the CIBIL website, include:1. Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5. Number of new accounts opened and number of accounts closed: Opening or closing accounts can affect your score, so managing these actions wisely is important.","Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity.

Limit management



New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

New NPS rule from April 1 : The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has enhanced National Pension System (NPS) security by adding a new layer called two-factor Aadhaar authentication . Starting April 1, all users logging into the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) system with passwords must use this feature, as per the PFRDA circular dated March 15, 2024.According to ET, using two-factor authentication greatly lowers the risk of unauthorised access to the CRA system . This added layer ensures the safety of NPS transactions and protects the interests of subscribers and stakeholders.The login process for NPS CRAs is changing. Following the circular, Aadhaar-based authentication will now be combined with the current user ID and password login system. This update enables access to the NPS central record-keeping agency (CRA) system through two-factor authentication.Here's how to log in to NPS using 2-factor authentication:1. Visit the NPS website: https://enps.nsdl.com/eNPS/NationalPensionSystem.html2. Click on 'Login with PRAIN/IPIN.'3. Select the PRAIN/IPIN tab, and a new window will open.4. Enter your user ID and password.5. Complete the Captcha verification.6. A window will prompt for Aadhaar authentication and send an OTP.7. Enter the OTP received on your registered mobile number.8. Submit the OTP.To bolster security and protect the interests of subscribers and stakeholders, the CRA system will now use Aadhaar-based authentication for login.

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

This decision underscores Google's growing focus on integrating Android 's capabilities directly into ChromeOS.Launched in August 2023, Lacros was designed to address a pain point for Chromebook users.By separating the Chrome browser from the core ChromeOS system, Google aimed to deliver faster and more frequent browser updates without requiring a full OS update. Lacros offered the potential for Chromebook users to experience the latest features and security patches in the Chrome browser more quickly.However, Google's recent announcement reveals a change in course. The company believes it can achieve ""similar objectives"" by leveraging the ongoing integration of Android's underlying functionalities within ChromeOS. This approach suggests that Google might be phasing out the need for a separate browser update system altogether.While the specific details remain under wraps, Google's decision to prioritize Android integration hints at the future of ChromeOS browsing. It's possible that future Chromebooks might not require a separate Chrome browser update system, with updates being delivered seamlessly through the core ChromeOS framework. This could lead to a more streamlined and user-friendly browsing experience for Chromebook users.With the Lacros experiment coming to a close, ChromeOS users will be looking forward to more details from Google regarding its future plans for browser updates and the evolving role of Android within the ChromeOS ecosystem.","Google has announced the end of the Lacros experiment, an initiative aimed at independently updating the Chrome browser on Chromebooks.

“My family. I took those who no one wanted. The discarded, the forgotten. I gave them a purpose. They're so happy that you remembered them. Because being a glutton for punishment doesn't make abandonment hurt any less. Forsaken, alone, begging for mercy as the buzzards circled. There's been loss; too much. But grief is the price you pay for love. But now, we must set the captives free, so they need no master. Do you think I... Do you think we are sick?""

This week on WWE RAW , Bo Dallas found his way into Adam Pearce’s office with a rather interesting proposition for SummerSlam . Based on the exchange between the two of them, Uncle Howdy could be facing Chad Gable at the biggest event this summer.Bo Dallas hasn’t been seen in the ring since 2019, and has been making sporadic appearances on screen through VHS tapes, alongside his alter ego, Uncle Howdy.With the recent revelation that he indeed is Uncle Howdy, and the leader of the Wyatt Sicks, there’s a high chance that he’ll be competing in the ring very soon.As of now, it’s likely that Uncle Howdy will be competing against Chad Gable at WWE SummerSlam. Furthermore, considering that The Fiend made his debut at the event, Uncle Howdy will follow suit.Earlier in the episode, the commentators found a video that was left for them. The video was equally eerie to all the other tapes featuring Uncle Howdy. In the new video, Dallas says:It’s currently unclear why the newly formed faction is targeting Chad Gable, but it will be worth seeing how WWE plans on executing the storyline for the newly formed Wyatt group, which includes Joe Gacy, Dexter Lumis, Erick Rowan, and Nikki Cross for now.Being present at SummerSlam is going to be beneficial for both parties at this point in time. The Wyatt Sicks and Chad Gable need the exposure that the upcoming event can easily provide. While WWE has not created a very supernatural aura surrounding Uncle Howdy at this point, they could do so in the near future to give the character a new dimension.Also read: Damian Priest Throw Out ‘Gentleman’s Agreement’, offered a rematch to Seth Rollins","Bo Dallas hasn’t been seen in the ring since 2019, and has been making sporadic appearances on screen through VHS tapes, alongside his alter ego, Uncle Howdy.
