Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

AI's ""jagged intelligence"" problem threatens AGI timeline

Major tech players still years away from true AGI





Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has issued a stark warning about artificial intelligence's critical flaw: inconsistency. Speaking on the "" Google for Developers"" podcast, Hassabis revealed that even the most advanced AI systems can ace elite mathematical competitions yet fail at elementary school problems—a vulnerability he says must be fixed before reaching artificial general intelligence (AGI).""It shouldn't be that easy for the average person to just find a trivial flaw in the system,"" Hassabis stated, highlighting how Google's Gemini models enhanced with DeepThink can win gold medals at the International Mathematical Olympiad but ""still make simple mistakes in high school maths.""Hassabis described current AI as having ""uneven intelligences"" or ""jagged intelligences""—excelling brilliantly in some dimensions while being easily exposed in others. This characterization echoes Google CEO Sundar Pichai's term ""AJI"" (artificial jagged intelligence) coined earlier this year to describe systems with uneven capabilities.The DeepMind chief emphasized that solving this inconsistency requires more than just scaling up data and computing power. ""Some missing capabilities in reasoning and planning in memory"" still need to be cracked, he explained, calling for better testing methodologies and ""new, harder benchmarks"" to precisely map AI strengths and weaknesses.Despite predicting AGI's arrival ""in the next five to 10 years"" in April, Hassabis acknowledges significant hurdles remain. His concerns align with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman 's recent assessment following GPT-5's launch, where Altman admitted the model lacks continuous learning capabilities—something he considers essential for true AGI.The warnings underscore a growing recognition among AI leaders that current systems' propensity for hallucinations, misinformation, and basic errors must be addressed before achieving human-level reasoning—a cautionary tale reminiscent of social media platforms' early failures to anticipate consequences at scale.",Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has issued a stark warning about artificial intelligence's critical flaw: inconsistency.

Rise of Chinese AI chip companies

China to tech companies: You cannot buy AI chips from Nvidia





Nvidia, the American semiconductor giant, has seen its dominance in China’s advanced chip market vanish, with its market share dropping from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls, according to CEO Jensen Huang. Speaking at a Citadel Securities event in New York earlier this month, Huang revealed that Nvidia is completely barred from selling its high-performance AI chips, including the A100, H100, and H200 models, to Chinese companies since restrictions began in 2022.A video of the interview was released recently. Huang expressed hope for a policy shift, stating, “We will continue to explain and inform and hold on to hope for a change in policy.” He emphasized that Nvidia’s exclusion from China not only harms the company but also has broader implications for both China and the U.S. “What harms China could oftentimes also harm America, and even worse,” Huang said. He further highlighted China’s significant role in global AI development, with roughly 50% of the world’s AI researchers.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's remarks come as China carries on with a nationwide push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.Chinese AI and semiconductor contenders have rushed to launch domestic alternatives, eroding Nvidia’s once-dominant market share. Huawei’s advancements, including clustering methods to bypass Nvidia’s technology and cutting-edge manufacturing techniques, signal China’s aggressive push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.Despite receiving US approval to sell a less powerful H20 chip tailored for the Chinese market, Nvidia faces further challenges. Chinese authorities launched a security investigation into the H20, and local clients were advised to avoid the product, further limiting Nvidia’s foothold. Huang warned that excluding Nvidia from China risks ceding the market to domestic competitors like Huawei Technologies, which recently unveiled an ambitious AI chip roadmap.“It’s a mistake not to have those researchers build AI on American technology,” Huang said, raising concerns about balancing U.S. technological leadership with global collaboration. As China accelerates its domestic chip development, Nvidia’s absence from the market could reshape the global AI and semiconductor landscape.Nvidia recently got shut out of the Chinese market after China’s internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, reportedly banned domestic tech companies from buying Nvidia AI chips. According to a report by Financial Times, the Chinese agency also told tech companies, including TikTok-parent ByteDance and Alibaba, to stop testing and ordering Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D server, a device designed specifically for the market in China.",N Nvidia's dominance in China's advanced chip market has dropped from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls.

Sales roles protected while support jobs disappear









Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is delivering contradictory messages about AI's role in the workplace. While his company recently eliminated 4,000 customer support positions in favor of AI agents, he told TBPN, a live daily YouTube show, this week that AI lacks something essential for sales roles—insisting artificial intelligence cannot replace human salespeople because it lacks the irreplaceable value of face-to-face communication.""AI doesn't have a soul. It's not that human connectivity,"" Benioff said, emphasising that face-to-face communication remains essential. Despite his company's aggressive AI deployment, he's now hiring between 3,000 and 5,000 new salespeople, aiming to reach 20,000 account executives this year.The hiring announcement comes months after Marc Benioff revealed on The Logan Bartlett Show podcast in September that Salesforce had slashed its customer support workforce from 9,000 to approximately 5,000 employees. ""I need less heads,"" he stated bluntly, explaining that AI agents now handle 50% of customer interactions that humans once managed.The job cuts have proven financially beneficial for Salesforce, reducing support costs by 17% since early 2025. The company's AI agents have completed over a million customer conversations, demonstrating the technology's capability to replace human workers in certain functions.Marc Benioff's distinction between roles reveals a strategic vision: AI can handle routine support tasks, but complex sales relationships still require human touch. He pointed to networking at Salesforce's Dreamforce conference as proof, noting the St. Regis Hotel bar was ""filled"" with customers ""talking to each other and connecting, going more deeply, having that human touch.""The CEO's stance contrasts sharply with broader industry trends, where over 64,000 tech workers have been laid off this year. Companies including Microsoft, Meta, and Google have all reduced headcount while investing heavily in AI, with customer service and sales roles ranking among the most vulnerable positions to automation.Benioff maintains this isn't dystopian but ""reality,"" even as his company exemplifies the dual nature of AI's workplace impact: eliminating some jobs while supposedly protecting others based on perceived irreplaceability of human connection.","Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is delivering contradictory messages about AI's role in the workplace.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Tonight, stargazers across the United States have a cosmic treat: the Orionid meteor shower peaks, offering up to 20 shooting stars per hour. From New York to Los Angeles, the best viewing is after midnight until dawn, with clear, dark skies giving skywatchers a front-row seat to Halley’s Comet debris streaking across the night sky. Don’t miss this annual celestial spectacle—perfect for a late-night blanket and a hot cocoa under the stars.If you love a little magic in the night sky, tonight is your chance! The Orionid meteor shower, born from debris left by Halley’s Comet, is lighting up the sky. Peak viewing starts late October 20 into the early hours of October 21, 2025, giving skywatchers across the Northern and Southern Hemispheres a stellar show.This year, you can expect up to 20 meteors per hour streaking across the sky, creating a dazzling display of “falling stars.” The best part? No telescope needed, your eyes are enough to enjoy the spectacle.The best time to see the Orionids in 2025 will be during their peak activity, which occurs on the night of Monday, October 20, into the early morning of Tuesday, October 21. For U.S. viewers, the key viewing window is between midnight and dawn.During the peak, observers under a clear, dark sky can expect to see an average of 10 to 20 meteors per hour.Pro-Tip: You do not need to look directly at the Orion constellation. Meteors will appear across the entire sky. In fact, looking 45 to 90 degrees away from Orion will give you longer, more impressive meteor streaks due to an effect called foreshortening.Even if you can’t reach these far-off locations, any dark spot away from city lights will dramatically improve your meteor viewing experience. Remember to bring a blanket, snacks, and binoculars if you have them.This year’s Orionid meteor shower comes at a perfect astronomical timing: it coincides with a new moon. That’s great news for stargazers because a new moon means the sky is naturally darker, with no moonlight washing out the faint meteors. Without the interference of a bright moon, even the smallest, faintest meteors become visible to the naked eye. This makes it easier to spot streaks shooting across the sky at up to 66,000 mph, producing the iconic “falling star” effect that makes meteor showers so magical.Another advantage this year is the late October timing. During this period, much of the United States experiences cooler, crisp autumn nights, which often coincide with clearer skies. Unlike summer evenings that may be hazy or humid, fall nights offer better air transparency, helping meteors appear brighter and more vivid. For US viewers, this combination of a new moon, cool autumn skies, and the Orionids’ peak activity makes 2025 a particularly prime year to witness the meteor shower.Even casual stargazers or families watching from their backyard can enjoy a spectacular display of up to 20 meteors per hour, creating a true “sky full of falling stars” experience that’s hard to forget. The Orionids aren’t just any meteor shower, they’re remnants of Halley’s Comet, streaking through our skies after millions of years. Tonight is a chance to witness 20 meteors per hour, make wishes, and share the moment with friends and family. So grab your blanket, maybe a thermos of cocoa, and head outside - your personal cosmic show awaits.","The Orionid meteor shower peaks tonight across the US, offering up to 20 meteors per hour for stargazers.

UK launches first digital ID: Is it similar to India's Aadhaar? Full details of the plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-launches-first-digital-id-is-it-similar-to-indias-aadhaar-full-details-of-the-plan/articleshow/124630189.cms,"AI image used for representative purpose

Why UK government launched this plan



What is the use of ID?



How Veteran can use access digital IDs?



Is it similar to India?







The UK government launched the digital version of its ID scheme on Friday, intended for former members of the armed services.This ID will mean passports, driving licenses, national insurance cards, and many more being virtual, instead of—or as well as—being stored in a shoebox or under socks in a drawer, Sky News reported.The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.The govt claims the initiative is designed to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for those without status to secure employment.Ministers contend that the ability to obtain jobs is a primary attraction for migrants entering the UK unlawfully. Under the new system, employers will no longer be able to depend on National Insurance numbers—which currently serve as part of proof of the right to work—or on paper-based verification methods, BBC reported.""At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy—people sharing National Insurance numbers for example. The idea is that having a picture attached would make it—in theory—harder to abuse that system,"" a government spokesperson explained.The digital IDs, which will be app-based and stored on smartphones akin to the NHS App or digital bank cards, will contain information such as the holder's residency status, name, date of birth, nationality, and a photograph.Sir Keir, when announcing the scheme, stated: ""You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that.""From today, Friday 17 October, it will give ex-soldiers a seamless way to confirm their status in person and will include information already featured on their physical card with the security features that protect their personal information.Ministers hope the digital veteran card will show how the technology works and quash public concerns about privacy and security.Veterans will now be able to hold their credentials in a smartphone app called Gov.uk One Login. The govt had previously announced that digital credentials, including the veteran card, would be stored in an app named Gov.uk Wallet. It now states it will “transition to talking about [One Login] as the Gov.uk Wallet” as more govt-issued credentials become available digitally. The credential will be stored under encryption in the app, similar to how a train or concert ticket is held in an Apple or Google wallet, The Guardian reported.Verification using face ID or a fingerprint will be required to access it, and the govt claims it is safer than physical IDs. Another version of the credential will be held by the Ministry of Defence, and as more IDs are added, the information will remain with each issuer and in the citizens’ app, ensuring there is no central database of all ID data, thereby avoiding what some have feared could be a “honeypot for hackers”.India has well established digital ID system. India’s digital ID system, Aadhaar, is significantly larger and more detailed than the UK’s planned system.New Delhi stores citizens’ fingerprints, eye scans, photos, home addresses and phone numbers, with the system processing approximately 80 million authentications daily.Under Aadhaar, every Indian citizen receives a 12-digit number intended to replace numerous paper documents. All adults and children over the age of five must provide biometric information. The system verifies identities for activities such as opening bank accounts or applying for new SIM cards. It also aimed to streamline the disbursement of govt benefits, providing holders with instant proof of identity and access to basic services.Aadhaar and UK's digital ID seems to be same.India also have other apps like DigiLocker, where you can store all the important documents like Aadhar Card, Pan card, driving license digitally at one place, Digi Yatra and many more.The UK's digital ID seems to be following the similar model of India. Like DigiLocker, UK is introducing Gov.UK Wallet. Few days ago, UK PM Keir Starmer made his first trip to India and hailed India’s ID system as a “massive success”.During his trade-centric visit to Mumbai, Starmer also met with Nandan Nilekani, co-founder and chair of Indian tech services group Infosys, who led the govt body responsible for delivering the ID database more than a decade ago.",The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.

On Cam: First Visuals Of Priceless Napoleon Jewels Robbed In Brazen Daylight Louvre Heist I Paris

What was stolen



Video sparks questions and investigation







The Louvre Museum, the world’s most-visited cultural landmark, was abruptly closed on Sunday following a daring daylight heist in the Apollon gallery, home to France’s crown jewels. A video of the incident has gone viral on social media, showing a suspect allegedly cutting through a glass display case with a mini chainsaw.According to French authorities, four balaclava-clad thieves arrived outside the museum along the Seine around 9:30 am, roughly half an hour after visitors began entering. The suspects used a truck with a basket lift and an extendable ladder to reach a second-floor balcony window. They then employed angle grinders and other power tools to smash glass displays and grab the priceless Napoleonic jewels.The robbery lasted less than 10 minutes, interior minister Laurent Nunez said, describing the culprits as “an experienced team who had clearly scouted the location.” As alarms sounded, the thieves fled on motorbikes, leaving behind some items, including Empress Eugenie’s crown and the Regent diamond, valued at more than US$60 million (£45m).The stolen items include a tiara, earrings, and a sapphire necklace from the jewellery sets of Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense, as well as pieces from the Marie-Louise set. These historic pieces were housed in the Apollon gallery, a hall built by Louis XIV in 1661, which later inspired the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles.Police are now analysing the viral video obtained by BFMTV, which appears to show one of the suspects trying to access a jewellery case. Authorities are probing how the thieves bypassed museum security, and who could be the potential buyers of such priceless, historic items.","Four balaclava-clad thieves arrived outside the museum around 9:30 am, roughly half an hour after visitors began entering.

A billionaire’s private life under scrutiny







Eric Schmidt, the 70-year-old former Google CEO, has been accused by his 31-year-old ex-girlfriend, Michelle Ritter, of abuse, stalking, and what she described as “absolute digital surveillance.” According to court filings obtained by The New York Post, Ritter alleged that Schmidt used his influence, wealth, and technical expertise to monitor her private communications and control her access to finances and property.The former couple’s relationship reportedly began in 2020, when Ritter was a student at Columbia University. The pair are now locked in a legal dispute involving multimillion-dollar settlements, a failed AI startup, and allegations of psychological control. Ritter claims Schmidt employed private investigators, coerced her into silence, and locked her out of shared business accounts and homes.Court filings reveal that Ritter and Schmidt maintained both romantic and business ties through Steel Perlot, an AI-focused venture into which Schmidt invested roughly $100 million. Ritter accuses Schmidt of using his power to impose “a system of total control” and claims he tracked her movements digitally.Schmidt, who remains married to philanthropist Wendy Schmidt, has denied the allegations through his attorneys, describing them as “demonstrably false” and “a misuse of the judicial process. ” Most filings remain sealed ahead of a December 2025 court hearing.In her filings, Ritter alleges that Schmidt pressured her to sign false declarations denying any misconduct while cutting off her access to shared assets and residences in New York, Miami, and Los Angeles. She further claimed her parents were followed by private investigators tied to Schmidt’s security detail. Despite withdrawing a previous restraining order after an apparent settlement, Ritter says Schmidt failed to fulfil his obligations and continues to pursue her through arbitration — a move she characterises as an attempt to “suppress exposure of his misconduct and abuse. ”This is not the first time Schmidt’s personal life has drawn public attention. Reports from Forbes and The Information have detailed turmoil within Steel Perlot, describing it as a chaotic venture entangled with personal and professional conflicts. Schmidt, whose net worth is estimated at $44.8 billion, has long been known for maintaining an open marriage and relationships with younger women. As the latest legal battle unfolds, the case reignites debate about privacy, power, and accountability in Silicon Valley’s elite circles — where technology, money, and influence can easily blur personal boundaries.","Michelle Ritter, 31, accuses former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, 70, of abuse, stalking, and what she described as ‘absolute digital surveillance’ Ritter claims Schmidt employed private investigators, coerced her into silence, and locked her out of shared business accounts and homes.

Kuwait's new rule: Mosques cannot install surveillance cameras without Ministry permission,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/kuwaits-new-rule-mosques-cannot-install-surveillance-cameras-without-ministry-permission/articleshow/124699894.cms,"Kuwait’s Awqaf Ministry issues strict new guidelines for mosque surveillance – monitoring, oversight and accountability now firmly in state hands / AI generated image for Illustration purposes only

What’s happening? Mosque surveillance rules in Kuwait

Any individual or organisation wishing to install or operate security cameras inside a mosque must first receive authorisation from the ministry.

Donations of cameras must be reported before installation: if someone offers a donation of surveillance equipment, the mosque’s imam or muezzin must notify the ministry before proceeding.

Any existing camera systems that were installed without ministry approval must be disclosed immediately.

The imams and muezzins will be held legally accountable if they fail to notify the ministry of unapproved systems.

The ministry states this is part of a broader effort to standardise mosque operations, protect mosque facilities and ensure the safety of worshippers.

Why the change?

Protection and safety of worshippers & facilities: The ministry explicitly says the aim is to safeguard the mosque premises, maintain safety, and ensure transparency.

Administrative control & oversight: By centralising supervision of camera systems, the ministry can ensure that installations comply with law and policy, rather than having ad-hoc or external parties setting up systems independently.

Standardising practices across mosques: The directive emphasises the goal of standardisation of mosque operations and functioning under governmental supervision.

Legitimacy of donations and external offers: Since mosques sometimes receive donated surveillance equipment (as happened in the past) the ministry appears to want to regulate that process tightly. For example, older reports show a corporate donation of 3,000 cameras to mosques in Kuwait from 2017.

Impacts and practical implications





On October 19, 2025, Kuwait’s Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs issued a nationwide directive mandating that all surveillance cameras within mosques must receive prior approval from the ministry. This move places imams and muezzins under legal obligation to comply, marking a significant shift in the oversight of religious institutions across the country.Kuwait's Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs has announced a new policy requiring all surveillance cameras in mosques to be approved by the ministry before installation. This directive, issued on October 19, 2025, mandates that imams and muezzins report any existing unapproved camera systems and prohibits unauthorized installations. The policy aims to standardize mosque operations, ensure transparency, and safeguard the facilities and worshippers.Key points:In short: New oversight means all surveillance inside mosques now must go through official channels.The ministry's decision comes in response to concerns over unauthorized surveillance installations and the need for centralized oversight. By requiring prior approval, the ministry seeks to maintain control over security measures in religious spaces, ensuring they align with national regulations and standards.This move also addresses potential privacy issues and aims to prevent misuse of surveillance systems.Several motivations appear behind this tightening of rules:Thus, the change reflects a move to ensure that mosque-surveillance is neither fragmented nor uncontrolled.The new rules have clear implications for mosques, imams, worshippers, and donors. Under the directive, no mosque can unilaterally accept or install surveillance cameras from external parties, including companies or donors, without prior ministry approval. Transparency is now mandatory: any offer of surveillance equipment must be reported before installation, and existing systems installed without authorization must be declared. Imams and muezzins carry legal responsibility for failing to comply, elevating the policy from mere guidance to enforceable law. All systems will fall under the ministry’s administrative oversight, which will likely regulate how cameras are installed, managed, and monitored. For donors, this means that contributions of surveillance equipment will require navigation through the approval process, replacing the previous practice of direct donations or installations. Overall, the directive establishes the ministry as the central gatekeeper for all mosque surveillance.For mosques across Kuwait, this policy means that any new surveillance installations must go through the ministry's approval process. Imams and muezzins are now legally responsible for promptly reporting any unapproved systems and ensuring compliance with the new regulations. Donors wishing to contribute surveillance equipment must also notify the ministry before installation. This centralized approach aims to streamline security measures and maintain uniformity across all religious institutions.","Kuwait’s Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs issued a nationwide directive mandating that all surveillance cameras within mosques must receive prior approval from the ministry.

Black Points system: How does the new program work?

Steps to avail services

Visit the Abu Dhabi Police platform on the first floor of Mushrif Mall Centre during the program period. Choose between point reduction (if under 24 points) or licence reinstatement (if suspended). Pay the applicable fee (Dh 800 for reduction, Dh 2,400 for reinstatement). Attend the educational courses and workshops in person. Complete the program to have points reduced or licence reinstated.

Quick recap

Date Time Location Eligibility Service Process Mode Fee (AED) Oct 20 – Nov 20, 2025 4 pm – 10 pm Mushrif Mall Centre, Abu Dhabi Drivers with fewer than 24 black points Reduce Black Points Attend traffic safety workshops In-person only 800 Oct 20 – Nov 20, 2025 4 pm – 10 pm Mushrif Mall Centre, Abu Dhabi Drivers with suspended licences (24+ points) Reinstate Licence Enroll in rehabilitation courses and complete education In-person only 2,400





Abu Dhabi Police has launched a key initiative allowing drivers to reduce traffic black points or reinstate suspended licences, running from October 20 to November 20, 2025. This one-month program operates daily between 4 pm and 10 pm at the Mushrif Mall Centre, first-floor Police platform, and aims to promote safer roads through education, making it easier for motorists to rectify violations.Black points are demerit points given out for serious traffic violations and accumulate according to how dangerous the offence is. Once a driver hits 24 points within a year, their licence usually gets suspended. This program gives drivers two clear options: lower their black points or reinstate a suspended licence.If you have fewer than 24 black points, you can attend specially designed workshops and educational courses to reduce up to eight points from your record. These sessions focus on educating drivers about traffic rules, safe driving habits, and the consequences of violations. The fee for this course is Dh800.For those whose licences have been suspended after surpassing 24 points, the route to reinstatement involves enrolling in a more comprehensive rehabilitation course. Upon successful completion and payment of Dh2,400, your driving licence can be restored. This educative approach helps ensure that reinstated drivers are better informed and more cautious moving forward.Importantly, the program is strictly an in-person affair. Motorists must physically be present at the Mushrif Mall Centre during the dates and timings because there is no online registration or virtual participation option. This ensures that participants get the full benefit of interacting with trainers and engaging in the corrective sessions.The initiative clearly reflects Abu Dhabi Police’s ongoing dedication to community safety by actively encouraging voluntary compliance and shared responsibility rather than resorting solely to fines and suspensions. It also builds on earlier successful efforts such as similar awareness programs launched at major events like the Abu Dhabi International Hunting and Equestrian Exhibition (ADIHEX) earlier in the year, reinforcing a culture of mutual respect and proactive participation.Black point penalties continue to stay on a driver’s record for one year, and avoiding violations during that time can help clear them. Drivers also have the ability to contest fines or have points transferred if the actual offender is identified. Along with various awareness campaigns, such as “A Day Without Accident,” these efforts collectively aim at fostering a safer road environment for all.In summary, Abu Dhabi aims to encourage safer driving habits, reduce accidents, and improve overall road safety . Mark your calendar, take advantage of this important initiative and get your driving record back on track.","Abu Dhabi Police has launched a key initiative allowing drivers to reduce traffic black points or reinstate suspended licences. Black points are demerit points given out for serious traffic violations and accumulate according to how dangerous the offence is. Once a driver hits 24 points within a year, their licence usually gets suspended. The program is strictly an in-person affair.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124688925,imgsize-169020,width-400,resizemode-4/abu-dhabi.jpg"

Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier has ramped up his investigation into Roblox, the hugely popular online gaming platform, issuing a criminal subpoena after evidence surfaced that sexual predators are exploiting the game to target minors.“Multiple investigations have revealed that sexual predators are using Roblox to access, communicate with, and groom minors,” Uthmeier said in a video posted on X. “Roblox profited off of our kids while exposing them to the most dangerous of harms. They enabled our kids to be abused. Companies like Roblox have become breeding grounds for predators to get to and have access to our kids.”The attorney general said predators have used the in-game currency, Robux, to bribe children into sending sexually explicit images. He added that victims accuse Roblox of failing to enforce adequate safety measures and of not warning parents of the risks.“These criminal subpoenas will enable us to gather more information for our prosecutors about the criminal activity taking place on Roblox’ platform as well as evidence on the predators that are out there and the victims that are abused,” Uthmeier said.Roblox responded that it shares the goal of keeping children safe and will continue to cooperate with the investigation, according to Florida Phoenix.“We have a strong record of working with law enforcement and investing in advanced safety systems to help protect our users and remove bad actors. To safeguard users, we prohibit the sharing of images and videos in the chat, use filters designed to block the exchange of personal information, and we are working to implement age estimation for all users accessing chat features,” the company said.Uthmeier appeared on Fox & Friends First to explain the investigation, noting that Florida authorities have arrested over 1,000 child predators this year alone, many linked to Roblox. He described predators posing as children, engaging in long-term conversations, and in some cases, committing physical abuse.Roblox has previously appeared on the National Center on Sexual Exploitation’s Dirty Dozen list for 2023 and 2024, which highlights entities accused of enabling or profiting from sexual abuse.",Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier has issued a criminal subpoena to Roblox.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

The campaign aims to promote the use of digital platforms for certificate submission, ensuring greater accessibility for pensioners.On the first day of this campaign, over 1.8 lakh pensioners successfully generated their digital life certificates, highlighting the growing adoption of technology among pensioners. This indicates a positive trend towards digitalization and the effective use of biometric authentication methods.A life certificate is an official document that verifies a pensioner's living status, required annually to continue receiving pension benefits.All pensioners, including family pensioners, must submit a life certificate to maintain their pension payments.Pensioners under 80 must submit their life certificate between November 1 and November 30 each year. Super senior citizens (80 and above) can submit theirs starting from October 1, with the same deadline.If the life certificate is not submitted by the deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting the following month.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online via the Jeevan Pramaan portal, through doorstep banking agents, using biometric devices at post offices, or in person at bank branches.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online by using the Jeevan Pramaan portal and completing biometric verification through designated apps.Yes, pensioners can submit their life certificates in person at their respective banks or post offices.Generally, you will need your Aadhaar number for biometric verification, along with any other identification or pension-related documents as required by your pension disbursing authority.Pensioners can check the status of their life certificate submission through the Jeevan Pramaan portal or by contacting their bank or pension disbursing authority.Yes, if your submission fails, you can reapply and submit your life certificate again using the same methods available to you.",Submission window for 'Jeevan Pramaan Patra' opens for pensioners under 80 with a deadline of November 30. Pensioners can opt to have a bank agent visit them at home to facilitate the submission of their life certificate. This method is particularly beneficial for those with mobility issues.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114942014,imgsize-53514,width-400,resizemode-4/114942014.jpg"

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

“We're relying a lot on Alibaba's Qwen model. It’s very good. It’s also fast and cheap.”

What Airbnb ’s new AI customer service agent can do



“I think the social features, the community, that’s probably the most differentiated part of Airbnb. People are the reason why I think Airbnb is such a sticky service.”

Why Airbnb is not being integrated into ChatGPT



“quite ready”

“I didn’t think it was quite ready,”

“almost self-contained”





Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky stated that the company typically does not use OpenAI 's latest models extensively in production for its AI tools. He noted that there are often faster, cheaper alternatives available. Recently, the travel app maker announced that it has updated its in-app artificial intelligence customer service agent, which was rolled out to all US users in English in May. The update allows customers to take more actions without needing a live representative. In an interview, Chesky revealed that the agent is built on 13 different AI models, sourced from providers including OpenAI, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s Qwen model, Alphabet Inc.’s Google , and other open-source providers.Chesky said to Bloomberg:He specifically praised the Alibaba model, saying,Airbnb's new AI-powered customer service agent now includes action buttons and links that allow users to handle tasks such as changing or cancelling reservations on their own.This update has resulted in a 15% decrease in users requiring help from a live representative and reduced the average resolution time from nearly three hours to six seconds. The company also plans to introduce Spanish and French language support later this year, followed by 56 additional languages next year.Apart from the AI agent, Airbnb has also introduced new social features aimed at helping users connect and enhancing travel recommendations within the app. Guests can now share their Airbnb profiles with others after booking an experience, and travellers who joined the same tour can message each other. However, conversations continue only if the recipient accepts the message request.More features are planned for next year, and Chesky said these could eventually support user-generated content on the platform.Chesky also noted that he has decided not to integrate the company’s app with OpenAI’s ChatGPT because the platform’s tools aren’tyet. He added that Airbnb will continue to monitor the development of ChatGPT’s app integrations and could consider collaborating in the future, similar to other travel platforms such as Booking Holdings and Expedia Group.Chesky said, explaining that because Airbnb is a community of verified users, OpenAI would need to build a platform strong enough for Airbnb’s app to function in anway within ChatGPT, the report noted.Chesky, who is friends with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman , said he has even advised the company on its new third-party developer features. Meanwhile, OpenAI has declined to comment but pointed to a recent blog post describing the app integration system as a developer preview with more updates expected, the report added.","Airbnb has updated its in-app artificial intelligence customer service agent.

Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has released a tool called DeepSeek OCR. This new open-source tool is designed to extract text from image files of pages with high efficiency. The project converts complex papers into a format that AI models can process quickly, with minimal memory or power consumption. The tool is designed to meet the high demand for large language models (LLMs) that must process both visual and textual data. DeepSeek OCR can process more than 200,000 pages of data per day on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. Scaling this to a small cluster could allow training sets for larger AI models to accumulate overnight. Developers can download DeepSeek OCR from GitHub or Hugging Face and integrate it into their own applications.DeepSeek-OCR starts with an image of a document, such as a scanned report or a newspaper page. Its first stage, called DeepEncoder, has about 380 million parameters and uses Meta’s Segment Anything Model (SAM) to divide the image into sections like text blocks or charts.SAM processes smaller parts of the image efficiently, even for large 1,024×1,024 pixel files. The visual data is then reduced from 4,096 patches to 256 tokens using a compact two-layer setup. These tokens go into a modified version of OpenAI ’s CLIP model, which links image and text understanding while keeping processing needs low.Next, a decoder powered by DeepSeek’s 3-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts model (DeepSeek-3B-MoE) takes over. Only about 570 million parameters are used at once, allowing the system to perform strongly while remaining efficient. When given the compressed tokens and a prompt, it generates text in clean formats like Markdown.DeepSeek-OCR adjusts its process based on the document type. For simple files like slides, it uses fewer tokens (around 64). For complex layouts like books or reports, it uses about 100 tokens for a balance of speed and accuracy. In dense cases, such as newspapers, it switches to “Gundam mode,” using up to 800 tokens and techniques like tiling to handle detailed layouts.On the OmniDocBench test, which measures document parsing performance, DeepSeek-OCR performed well using fewer tokens compared to other systems. It required only 100 tokens where competitors used hundreds or thousands, and it produced fewer text errors, particularly in English and Chinese documents.","DeepSeek OCR can process more than 200,000 pages of data per day on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.

LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman has warned that Silicon Valley’s obsession with software may be creating a blind spot, leaving companies at risk of missing the next major AI opportunities. Speaking on the a16z podcast recently, Hoffman said the tech industry’s mindset that “everything should be done in software” has driven decades of success but now limits innovators from spotting new possibilities. The belief, he said, now risks keeping innovators from seeing new opportunities.Hoffman questioned during the podcast “What are the areas where the AI revolution will be magical?”“That's probably where I've been putting the majority of my co-founding time, invention time,” he said.Hoffman highlighted biology and healthcare as areas ripe for AI-driven transformation, saying AI tools could guide scientists toward promising experiments even if predictions are correct only a small fraction of the time. He clarified that he isn't betting on AI being able to design drugs independently. Instead, AI tools could guide scientists toward the most promising experiments, he said.“This is not a needle in a haystack; it’s like a needle in a solar system,” he said, explaining how AI could accelerate research in ways humans alone cannot.He added that the next iconic AI companies may come from sectors most investors consider slow, complex, or heavily regulated, rather than the traditional software space.""I've been thinking about the intersection of the worlds of atoms and the worlds of bits,"" Hoffman continued, adding ""What are things that elevate human life?""Hoffman’s warning reflects a growing trend in AI for healthcare, where companies like Microsoft and Nvidia are already deploying AI for hospital operations, medical imaging, and drug discovery. His comments urge Silicon Valley to expand its focus beyond software if it wants to lead in the next generation of AI innovation.","LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman says Silicon Valley's obsession with software is creating a blind spot.

The launch marks a major step in Anthropic’s push to democratize access to agentic AI tools. “We’re continuing to put Claude Code everywhere, helping it meet developers wherever they are,” said Cat Wu, Product Manager at Anthropic.Claude Code goes beyond autocomplete tools like GitHub Copilot by enabling developers to spin up autonomous agents that can tackle complex coding tasks. These agents can write, debug, and optimize code with minimal human input, making them ideal for rapid prototyping and large-scale development.Key features include:Wu revealed that Claude Code has grown 10x in users since May and now contributes over $500 million in annualized revenue. She also noted that 90% of Claude Code’s own product is written by Anthropic’s AI models.Anthropic joins a competitive field of AI coding tools, including offerings from Google, OpenAI, and GitHub. While early tools focused on line-by-line suggestions, Claude Code represents a shift toward agentic generation, where developers manage AI assistants that operate more independently.Despite concerns that AI coding tools may slow developers in complex environments, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei remains bullish. He predicts that AI will soon write 90% of code for software engineers—a reality already unfolding inside Anthropic itself.","Anthropic has officially brought its AI coding assistant, Claude Code, to the web.
