A video is doing rounds on social media , that captured a 23-year-old man, identified as Mukesh Kumar , lying still on a busy road in Kasganj, pretending to be dead.In the video, it can be seen that his 'lifeless' body was covered with a white bed sheet, cotton was stuffed in his nostrils, and a flower garland around his neck, creating a disturbingly realistic scene.However, as the video concluded, Kumar abruptly came to life, erupting in laughter. The astonished bystanders realised they had been tricked into witnessing an elaborate prank and promptly notified the authorities.Consequently, local police arrested Kumar for causing public disturbance and mischief. The video, shared on X, was captioned, ''In #UttarPradesh's Kasganj district, a young man pretended to die by lying down in the middle of a busy intersection. The police have arrested the ' reel star ' Mukesh Kumar.""According to Shri Rajesh Bharti, additional superintendent of police, the incident took place at the Raj Cold Storagearea in Kasganj, Uttar Pradesh. In a video statement, he said, ''The man has made a video by sleeping on the road and creating a shock through his video. Taking cognisance of this, we have arrested the man identified as Mukesh Kumar and necessary action will follow.""The stunt video has triggered widespread criticism from social media users, who condemned Kumar for his insensitive and attention-seeking behaviour. His reckless attempt at going viral has provoked outrage and raised concerns about the perils of social media obsession.One user commented, ''Reel makers are ready to go to any extent,'' while another remarked, ''I never thought people would stoop so low for views.'' A third user wrote, ''The world is full of strange and crazy people, they should be given training to make good reels.'' Another added, ''This reel disease is increasing.''","A video is doing rounds on social media that captured a 23-year-old man, identified as Mukesh Kumar, lying still on a busy road in Kasganj, Uttar Pradesh.

The bed in what looked like a hotel- room was decorated with photographs of the couple on all sides with flower petals and the question “Will you marry me?” Written in flowers at the centre of the bed.

The happily engaged female superstar flaunted her engagement ring in the subsequent photographs on her posts.Valkyria is officially signed with WWE since January 20, 2020.

Iran launches new research satellite into orbit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iran-launches-new-research-satellite-into-orbit/articleshow/113360365.cms,"Iran on Saturday blasted a new research satellite into orbit, state media said, in the latest such development for an aerospace programme that has long faced Western criticism. ""The Chamran-1 research satellite was successfully launched and put into orbit by the Ghaem-100 carrier.""The satellite, which weighs around 60kg, is designed to test hardware and software systems for orbital manoeuvre technology, the TV report said.The device was designed and built by Iranian Electronics Industries affiliated with the defence ministry, state TV said.Western governments including the United States have repeatedly warned Iran against such launches, saying the same technology can be used for ballistic missiles, including ones designed to deliver a nuclear warhead.The Ghaem-100 rocket which carried the latest satellite is manufactured by the aerospace organisation of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps . The carrier is the country's first three-stage solid-fuel satellite launcher, and official media reported its use in Jan as to send a satellite for the first time into an orbit above 500km. afp","The Chamran-1 research satellite was successfully launched and put into orbit by the Ghaem-100 carrier.

The release of Meghan’s book could further inflame tensions between the Sussexes and the Royal Family , particularly following the mixed reception of Harry's memoir, Spare.Bower also criticized Meghan’s acting career, remarking, “The problem is, she isn’t a great actress. Her acting career ended long before she arrived in London - that’s why she came here. She couldn’t find any more work after Suits.”Speculation about Meghan’s autobiography has been circulating since Harry’s book gained attention in early 2023. Some publishing experts believe it is strategic for the couple to delay further releases, as maintaining public interest is crucial. An insider noted, “Fans are fickle. Disappoint them once, and a book can freefall into irrelevance super quickly, even with the momentum of something like Spare behind it. Their team, who are good at what they do, wants to make the angry mobs salivate for it before throwing Meghan’s story to the masses because even the bad press is good press for this couple.”","Royal expert Tom Bower has highlighted the lucrative possibilities of such a book, predicting it could significantly boost their income.

Hobby apps over dating apps? Why fitness and reading platforms are the new matchmakers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/hobby-apps-over-dating-apps-why-fitness-and-reading-platforms-are-the-new-matchmakers/articleshow/113214577.cms,"Strava sees significant growth

Hobby platforms turned social networks

Why the shift?

The changing landscape of social apps

Dating apps like Tinder and Bumble are no longer the go-to platforms for singles seeking love. Instead, people are now turning to Goodreads and Strava , apps initially designed for running, reading, and other hobbies, to find their perfect match.Strava, the popular fitness app known for tracking running and cycling activities, has experienced a substantial 20% increase in user numbers over the past year, according to Sensor Tower and reported by The Guardian.This surge in users has prompted Strava to introduce a new messaging feature, allowing users to connect while tracking their fitness goals.Other hobby-based apps are also seeing a boost in users. Ravelry, a social network for knitting enthusiasts, now boasts a user base of over 9 million. Goodreads, the platform for book lovers, has accumulated more than 150 million members. Meanwhile, Letterboxd , an app for movie enthusiasts, has seen its user base explode from 1.8 million in March 2020 to over 14 million this summer. The app’s impressive 55% growth in monthly active users highlights the increasing popularity of these niche social networks.Dr Carolina Are, a social media researcher at the Centre for Digital Citizens at Northumbria University, explains that these hobby-based apps allow users to connect through shared interests, creating a more engaging and less contentious environment. This focus on common passions reduces the need for stringent content moderation and enhances the overall user experience.Letterboxd’s editor-in-chief, Gemma Gracewood, adds that the app’s design, which includes in-line comments and a community-focused approach, discourages public shaming and amplifies the positive interactions among users. Similarly, Goodreads and Strava offer messaging features that foster connections without the risk of public shaming prevalent on other platforms.As users increasingly migrate from traditional social networks and dating apps, new platforms are emerging as havens for genuine connections. With many abandoning Elon Musk’s social network due to controversies over free speech, apps like Bluesky and Threads are seeing a resurgence, while hobby-based platforms continue to thrive.Are suggests that the lower expectations and less sexually charged atmosphere on these hobby apps create a more relaxed environment for users seeking meaningful connections. Unlike traditional dating apps, which can often feel like a “dating supermarket,” these platforms offer a refreshing alternative for those looking to find love through shared interests.","Strava, the popular fitness app known for tracking running and cycling activities, has experienced a substantial 20% increase in user numbers over the past year.

Prince William's royal plans: No room for Harry and Meghan after becoming king?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/prince-williams-royal-plans-no-room-for-harry-and-meghan-after-becoming-king/articleshow/113146748.cms,"The William-Harry rift deepens

As Prince William gears up for his future role as King , it seems there's no room for reconciliation with his brother, Prince Harry , and sister-in-law, Meghan Markle . According to an insider speaking to OK! Magazine, William's strategy is ""swift and final,"" setting the stage for a significant shift in Royal Family dynamics.The source revealed that William has a clear vision for his reign, which involves a deliberate distancing from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.This approach aligns with previous reports suggesting that the Sussexes will be relegated to the periphery of royal life, with no hopes for reintegration.""William is already strategizing for his time as King, and he doesn’t see a future for the Sussexes within the Royal Family,"" the insider said. ""The prevailing sentiment is that bringing them back into the fold would be a mistake.""According to a former palace staff member, William might even consider issuing a Letters Patent to strip the Sussexes of their HRH titles, although their Dukedom could only be addressed by Parliament. This move would ensure a formal and irreversible separation from the royal family.The tensions between William and Harry have been well-documented, particularly following the release of Harry’s memoir, Spare. One notable point of contention for William has been Harry’s depiction of Kate Middleton’s supposed coldness towards Meghan. Insiders report that William has been reticent about discussing Harry lately, suggesting the rift remains wide and deep.The brothers' strained relationship was evident at a recent memorial for their uncle, Sir Robert Fellowes. Attendees noted that William and Harry kept their distance, barely acknowledging each other's presence.As Prince William prepares for his future role, it appears the divide between him and Harry is set to become a defining feature of his reign, leaving the Sussexes on the fringes of royal life.","Prince William's strategy is ""swift and final,"" an insider told OK!

He then asked someone, presumed to be his mother, to read it to him.Since being posted, a video had received nearly 3 million views and over 73k likes.Social media users praised Trump for this gesture and echoed Smith in criticising the media for not highlighting such actions.

In the images, the utilitarian bins come to life with carefully arranged accessories - cameras, headphones, tickets. Some displays get elaborate, adding designer purses and makeup, while others simply arrange commonplace items in a nicer way.A recent video showed a creator's monochrome variations for different cities. Others opt to display the contents of their gadget-filled personal carry-on item or their favourite book. For Hitha Palepu , the author of ""How to Pack: Travel Smart for Any Trip"", the trend is one of her ""biggest travel pet peeves and icks"" for several reasons: inconsideration of fellow travellers and security staff, ""gross"" hygiene and an unrealistic portrayal of the messy - and often stressful - realities of travel. (A 2018 study found that the plastic trays carry more cold germs than airport toilets.)As if the base line anxiety of travel weren't enough to deal with, adding ""annoyed"" to the roster of emotions might send some travellers like Celeste Hernandez, 27, over the edge. ""The way I'm waiting for TSA to yell at me just because I'm taking my sweater off,"" she said, en route to Houston from New York. But some said onlookers were too quick to be grumpy about the latest influencer trend. The posts, many said, were meant to be expressive, celebrate the joy of travel or bond with friends.The Transportation Security Administration is aware of the trend, but a spokesperson said the agency had no problem with it ""as long as the staged glamour photos are not causing delays or issues with other passengers in the checkpoint.""The trend may have started as a way to help sell products. A video on this topic was a marketing attempt by Sarin Jivalagian, the founder of an online store for vintage bags . She and her friends arranged a photoshoot on some benches after the security line at Hollywood Burbank Airport in California. Some people jumped to conclusions, she said, assuming that she had been holding up the line. ""Did you do this in Des Moines, Iowa?"" One commenter asked, ""because where did they let you take up this much time in TSA????"" Even if pictures are taken after security, ""that's one less bin to get through security seamlessly,"" Palepu, the author, said.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What users can do

Hackers have reportedly infected over 1.3 million TV streaming boxes that are running on software based on Android Open Source Project ( AOSP ) that allows developers to create custom variants of the Android OS for their own devices. Google has also said that the infected devices are not running Android TV.According to a report by France-based cybersecurity company Doctor Web , hackers have installed a new Vo1d backdoor malware that allows them to take full control of the devices.“Doctor Web experts have uncovered yet another case of an Android-based TV box infection. The malware, dubbed Android.Vo1d, has infected nearly 1.3 million devices belonging to users in 197 countries. It is a backdoor that puts its components in the system storage area and, when commanded by attackers, is capable of secretly downloading and installing third-party software.The largest number of infections have been detected in Brazil, Morocco, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Malaysia, Algeria and Indonesia.The cybersecurity company explains that there are multiple variants of the malware that are used to infect systems depending on the version of software they are running. They all can download and run executables when commanded to monitor specified directories. Another versionResearchers believe these software versions have been targeted because they commonly run outdated software with vulnerabilities.""One possible infection vector could be an attack by an intermediate malware that exploits operating system vulnerabilities to gain root privileges. Another possible vector could be the use of unofficial firmware versions with built-in root access,” the company says.To prevent infection by this malware, users can check for and install new firmware updates as they become available. These boxes must be disconnected from the internet in case users see any unexpected activity. Users are also advised to not install Android applications as APKs from third-party sites on Android.Google has also clarified that the infected devices are not running Android TV.“These off-brand devices discovered to be infected were not Play Protect certified Android devices. If a device isn't Play Protect certified, Google doesn’t have a record of security and compatibility test results.

Used PUBG chatrooms to communicate

In a disturbing development, militants in Swat , Pakistan, reportedly employed tactics inspired by the popular video game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) to carry out an attack on a local police station. According to a report in news agency ANI, the militants utilised PUBG 's in-game chat rooms to communicate and coordinate their activities, making it difficult for authorities to track their movements.This use of technology allowed them to evade electronic surveillance and plan their attack with relative ease.On August 28, the Banr police station in Swat came under attack, resulting in the death of one police officer and injuries to two others. Following the incident, a thorough investigation was launched by district police.Initial analysis of CCTV footage led investigators to believe that a hand grenade was used in the attack. However, further investigation revealed that the militants had instead employed an improvised explosive device (IED) constructed from a power bank.Dr Zahidullah , the district police officer of Swat, disclosed that the militants had used PUBG as a tool for training and motivation. The game's chat rooms provided a secure platform for communication, enabling them to maintain contact with their group members and families in Afghanistan.Through investigation, authorities identified one suspect and subsequently apprehended several others with connections to a local militant group led by Murad alias Rehmatullah, affiliated with the bannedTehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan .The arrested suspects revealed that they used PUBG chat rooms to communicate with their group members and families in Afghanistan. To avoid detection, they frequently changed their mobile phones and SIM cards.Dr Zahidullah noted that the families of the arrested militants, who had fled to Afghanistan during Operation Rah-i-Rast in 2009, remain involved in militant activities. Approximately 2,000 families of militants from Swat are believed to be residing in Afghanistan.","Militants in Swat, Pakistan, employed tactics inspired by the popular video game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) to carry out an attack on a local police station.

Anand Mahindra encounters ‘Mumbai-style traffic jam’ in Venice: Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/anand-mahindra-encounters-mumbai-style-traffic-jam-in-venice-watch/articleshow/113389568.cms,"Anand Mahindra encountered a traffic jam in Venice

How the users reacted to the post

Mahindra Group chairman, Anand Mahindra recently shared an observation on social media : he encountered a traffic jam in Venice, Italy, that reminded him of the chaotic traffic in Mumbai. However, to his surprise, he found the Venetian traffic jam to be less stressful.Mahindra posted a 30-second video of the Venetian canal filled with boats, highlighting the resemblance to Mumbai's busy roads.He noted that despite the congestion, the atmosphere in Venice was far more relaxed and enjoyable compared to the hectic pace of Mumbai's traffic.“Traveled all the way to Venice only to run into a Mumbai-style traffic jam! (Ok, I admit this traffic pile-up is less stressful…)”, wrote Mahindra in a post shared on X (formerly known as Twitter).Agreeing with Mahindra, X users also started sharing their own experiences of traffic jams in different cities. Here are some of the user reactions:‘In monsoons, you can visit Delhi instead of Venice. You will get a similar experience at a fraction of the cost.‘That’s a humorous way to put it! It’s funny how certain experiences, like traffic jams, can be so universally familiar, even in a city as picturesque as Venice. And it’s good to know that this one is a bit more relaxing!’‘At least, there are no other vehicles in Venice except boats. I loved the island. Alternative - if you have strong legs, you can walk, no traffic jam.’‘Looks like Mumbai traffic decided to follow you all the way to Venice! At least this one comes with better views and a bit more charm’","Anand Mahindra encountered a traffic jam in Venice, Italy, that reminded him of the chaotic traffic in Mumbai.
