'Maut ka kuan' gets global spotlight but its riders are barely hanging on,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maut-ka-kuan-gets-global-spotlight-but-its-riders-are-barely-hanging-on/articleshow/113141217.cms,"As a ' maut ka kuan ' ( well of death ) pro, Rubel Sheikh, a native of Malda, West Bengal, has been flirting with danger for over a decade. Ironically, fame or money still hasn't come his way even though the viral music video of Indian rapper Hanumankind aka Sooraj Cherukat has catapulted his sport from small-town melas to the global spotlight. ""For Rs 18,000-20,000 a month, we endanger our lives daily for the entertainment of others.Those who shoot videos with our stunts go viral. Can we also make videos and increase our audience? But we don't know how to edit,"" rues Sheikh, the sole earning member in his family of five.The 28-year old is a builder too, using nuts and bolts to join the wooden beams for the 22-ft-high arena. He then scales its near-vertical walls with Maruti 800 cars and old Yamaha and Pulsar bikes.'Well of Death', known as 'maut ka kuan' in India, is a daring motorbike or car stunt performance that originated in early 20th-century American carnival sideshows. Riders defy gravity as they loop endlessly around a wooden cylinder, suspended by sheer centrifugal force. They pop in and out of cars to hold and release riders while still in motion, thrilling audiences watching from above.The spectacle used to be a staple of circuses and melas in the pre-cable and internet era. Munira Abdul Sattar Madni, who began riding in 1971 when she was 7, was the first female rider to take on this death-defying act, inspired by her father who built these structures across the country.Despite a glut of motorcycle influencers performing heart-stopping wheelies for an internet audience today, the 'maut ka kuan' performances still hang on, like its riders, in smaller towns and villages.Accidents are common. In April, a stuntman and his female associate were injured after the car had a flat tyre midway. Last year, nearly nine people were injured after a bike stuntman lost control and rammed into the audience at a fair in West Bengal's Asansol.""Once you start your vehicle inside the well, there is only danger. But we can't wear a helmet while doing these stunts. Riders have to look sideways and back to interact and collaborate. Someone or the other keeps breaking an arm or a leg. We give full hospital support to fix it,"" says Sajan Seth, who started a small company of 'maut of kuan' performers after 15 years in the profession. He is now camped at a mela in Raiganj in the Uttar Dinajpur district of West Bengal and plans to entertain the 20-odd visitors with a Maruti 800 riding the well. Two other bikers will slip off the edge of their seats to add some more drama. ""When we were new, we would get terrible vertigo. Now, we are used to it,"" says Seth, who trained under an 'ustad' for a couple of years in Jammu & Kashmir.Rising fuel costs and modest ticket prices mean the profit margin is slim. Old models of Maruti and Yamaha RX100 are stripped of silencers so that the roar heightens the thrill for audiences who often dangle currency notes from the edge of the well for riders to catch mid-stunt. ""The high-pitched sound of the bikes prevents us from getting permission to perform in big cities. This is a major issue, restricting us to smaller towns and villages although we would like better opportunities,"" says Anil Khan, 46, who has been a rider for 30 years now.Several professional stunt artists in the film industry have tried the well of death, albeit with more protection and support. Saharanpur-based stunt double Javed Gauri, who enacted the 'Maut Ka Kuan' sequence for Salman Khan in the 2019 film 'Bharat', has the highest respect for practitioners of the sport. ""It is the most dangerous of all the vehicular stunts I know. It has the maximum chance of death. And if even one biker falters, others invariably go down with him,"" says Gauri, who says he has pulled off motordrome acts on a scooty in melas in Saharanpur. ""I have also done it for college and corporate shows for brand promotions. I got my stunt double gig for 'Race 3' in Dubai after Salman bhai was impressed by my performance in 'Bharat',"" says Gauri.Sheikh, currently near India's border with Bhutan where he will perform at an expo, is far from finding fame. When the show season passes, he returns to the village and tills the fields. Yet, the thrill of the well keeps calling him back. ""It makes me happy to see the audience happy,"" he says.","'Well of Death', known as'maut ka kuan' in India, is a daring motorbike or car stunt performance that originated in early 20th-century American carnival sideshows.

While the technical features are expected to be impressive, the pricing across various regions has been a significant point of interest, given the price variation due to local taxes, duties, and market strategies.Below is a detailed breakdown of the expected prices for each iPhone 16 model across various countries.To determine the cheapest country to buy the iPhone 16 based on the latest exchange rates, here is a comparison of the prices in local currencies:Thus, the USA is expected to offer the iPhone 16 at the lowest price of $799.The price differences across countries for the iPhone 16 series can be attributed to several factors:Many countries, such as India and those in the European Union, impose high taxes and import duties on electronic goods. This results in a higher retail price for the iPhone 16 in those regions compared to countries with lower or no import duties.Exchange rates play a crucial role in determining iPhone prices in different countries. Apple adjusts its pricing to maintain profitability across regions with varying currency strengths. For instance, a country with a weaker currency may see higher prices due to fluctuations in exchange rates.Apple is expected to introduce notable design enhancements across all four models of the iPhone 16 series. One of the key features is the inclusion of a dedicated capture button on all models. Additionally, the entire lineup is rumored to sport a glossy titanium finish, offering not only a sleek and premium look but also better scratch resistance compared to the stainless steel finishes of earlier models.The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are anticipated to have larger displays, measuring 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches, respectively. On the other hand, the standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will maintain the same screen sizes as their predecessors but will feature slight design tweaks such as a new vertical camera layout and additional physical buttons.For the Pro models, photography capabilities are expected to be significantly improved, with the inclusion of a 48MP Ultra Wide camera and a Tetraprism 5x optical zoom lens. The standard iPhone 16 models are likely to feature a vertical camera arrangement, potentially supporting spatial video recording.In terms of battery capacity, the iPhone 16 is rumored to have a 3,561mAh battery, the iPhone 16 Plus a 4,006mAh battery, the iPhone 16 Pro a 3,577mAh battery, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max a 4,676mAh battery. The Pro models may also incorporate stacked battery technology for enhanced capacity and longevity.

NEW DELHI: Football stars are known not only for their extraordinary talent on the pitch but also for the lavish lifestyles that come with their success.Among the most luxurious possessions of these athletes are their private jets .

Nile crocodiles: A fearsome species

Cassius: The largest crocodile

A massive 16-foot, 700 kg Nile crocodile named Henry , has been officially recognised as the world's oldest crocodile at 123 years old. The crocodile has fathered over 10,000 offspring with his six mates, according to the zoo where he inhabits.Henry, known for his big size and fearsome fangs, is nearly equivalent to that of a minibus. He was born on December 16, 1900, in the Okavango Delta, Botswana , a Unesco World Heritage Site .In the early 1900s, Henry was believed to have preyed on children from a local Botswana tribe. Frustrated with his deadly behavior, the tribe sought the help of renowned hunter Sir Henry Neumann in 1903. Instead of killing Henry, Neumann opted to capture him, sentencing the crocodile to a lifetime in captivity.Henry has spent the last thirty years at the Crocworld Conservation Centre in Scottburgh, South Africa. He is admired from a safe distance at the conservation centre, far removed from his violent past.Nile crocodiles, found across 26 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, are known for their aggressive nature. These apex predators inhabit various aquatic environments, including lakes, rivers, swamps, and marshes. Known for their brutality, Nile crocodiles often prey on animals such as zebras and porcupines. Tragically, hundreds of people fall victim to these formidable predators each year.Although Henry holds the title of the oldest crocodile, Cassius, a 16-foot saltwater crocodile from Australia, is known as the largest. Captured in 1984, Cassius is a prominent feature at the Marineland Melanesia Crocodile Habitat on Green Island, off the coast of Queensland. In 2011, he was officially recognized by Guinness World Records as the world’s largest living saltwater crocodile.","Henry was born on December 16, 1900, in the Okavango Delta, Botswana.

Cosplay: Fantasy meets reality: Why Chinese women are hiring female cosplayers to play dream men,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/fantasy-meets-reality-why-chinese-women-are-hiring-female-cosplayers-to-play-dream-men/articleshow/113095221.cms,"Bringing dream man to reality



Day out in the city



A new kind of relationship



Raising the bar



Emotional satisfaction in a new era



In the final years of high school, Xu Yunting, a Chinese teenager, stumbled upon an unusual side gig—transforming herself into male video game characters and taking their female fans on dates. What started as a way to make pocket money became part of a burgeoning trend in China, known as "" cos commissioning "".This unique job has taken off in China, with many young women using their purchasing power to transform digital fantasies into real-world experiences.The trend has sparked massive interest online, where social media platforms are buzzing with posts about cos commissioning.The concept? Fans of romance games hire female cosplayers to become their favorite male characters and accompany them on dates, creating a fusion of virtual fantasy and reality.Xu Yunting has perfected the art of embodying male characters from popular romance games. One of her most-requested roles is ""Jesse,"" a sensitive musician from ' Light and Night ,' a mobile game produced by tech giant Tencent that allows players to fall in love with various fictional men.Feng Xinyu, a lively 19-year-old, is one of Xu’s regular clients. For Feng, real-life men—whom she refers to as ""3D men""—don’t hold the same appeal as the perfect, fictional characters she encounters in games.“I’m just not interested in dating real guys,” Feng explains. “Game characters are more idealised and fulfilling to me.”'Light and Night' has become a favorite for young women like Feng. It promises a deeply immersive love experience, allowing players to develop emotional connections with their virtual suitors. Players like Feng, who identify as ""dream girls,"" often form intense emotional attachments to the game’s characters. Cos commissioning takes this to another level, bringing these 2D beaus into the real world.Feng has hired Xu three times now to play Jesse, each time paying roughly $70. However, Feng recently splurged on a much more expensive trip with another Jesse cosplayer, spending $2,800 for a multi-day experience. In the end, though, she decided that Xu captured the essence of Jesse better and returned to her for another date.“She’s just like the character,” Feng said to the AFP team. ""It feels like we were meant to be together.""Feng greeted Xu with delight when they met at the metro station. The two held hands and chatted happily as they embarked on their date, which Feng had meticulously planned and paid for.Starting with a relaxing tea break to an indulging hotpot dinner. Their date also included a doll-painting workshop and a cake-decorating class—activities where they were just one of many cos commission pairs.Businesses have taken notice of the trend. Employees at the cake-decorating class shared that they now regularly see cos commission couples. What began as a niche phenomenon is rapidly becoming mainstream.Experts suggest that cos commissioning isn’t just about fantasy—it’s about control and empowerment. The women paying for these experiences get to design their ideal relationship, free from the uncertainties and frustrations of dating real men. They also feel safer and more understood in these interactions, especially since many of the cosplayers, like Xu, are women themselves.“In these interactions, it doesn’t matter what gender the cosplayer is,” says Tian Qian, a professor at Fudan University. “What matters is that the cosplayer becomes a vessel for the client’s emotions, bringing their fantasy to life.”For many young women, the appeal of these interactions lies in their ability to construct an idealized, heteronormative relationship. Conservative social norms around gender roles still dominate Chinese society, often reinforced by state media and popular culture.Zhou Zixing, another academic, has observed that cos commissioning gives women an opportunity to experience relationships on their own terms, where their desires are prioritized.Xu, who enjoys bringing fictional characters to life, believes the experience of dating game characters can positively influence her clients’ expectations of real-life partners.""The men in these games are high-quality,"" Xu explained. ""By experiencing this kind of relationship, I think women can raise their standards in real life and avoid settling for less.""Xu’s mother, Fang Xiuqing, initially struggled to understand her daughter’s work. ""At first, I couldn’t believe this was something my daughter would do,"" Fang admitted. But over time, she has come to see cos commissioning as a harmless and enjoyable activity that brings joy to others.“It’s a hobby more than a job,” Fang said. “She’s happy doing it, and she makes other people happy too.”As the cos commissioning trend grows, it offers more than just a paid service—it provides emotional satisfaction for those who engage in it. Fudan University’s Tian Qian describes it as “emotional sustenance,” saying that even though the interaction is transactional, it still gives clients a sense of being cared for and seen.In a society where traditional dating norms can feel limiting, cos commissioning offers a creative and controlled way for women to engage in romance. For many, it’s not just about meeting their dream game character—it’s about constructing a relationship that caters to their needs, desires, and fantasies in ways real-world relationships often can’t.As this phenomenon continues to expand, it challenges conventional ideas of love and companionship, offering a glimpse into the evolving ways in which people form connections in the digital age.","'Cos commissioning' is a growing trend in China.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision. The US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business. Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103974505,imgsize-166292,width-400,resizemode-4/103974505.jpg"

Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram , has recently become the subject of widespread speculation after older photos of him resurfaced online. These images have led many to wonder whether the billionaire entrepreneur underwent plastic surgery to enhance his appearance. Adding to the intrigue, Durov was recently arrested in France, raising further questions about the man behind the popular messaging app.Pavel Durov, a 39-year-old entrepreneur originally from Russia, is best known as the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.Telegram quickly gained popularity for its strong emphasis on user privacy, offering end-to-end encryption and other security features that set it apart from competitors. As of now, Forbes estimates Durov's net worth to be around $15.5 billion. Despite his success in the tech industry, Durov has managed to maintain a relatively low profile—until now.Durov's recent arrest in Paris has added a new layer of complexity to his public image. He was detained in France on charges of suspected complicity in running an online platform involved in illicit activities, including child exploitation, drug trafficking, and fraud. While these allegations are serious, it is the sudden focus on Durov's physical transformation that has captured the internet's attention.Pavel Durov has been active on social media platforms like Instagram since 2011, regularly sharing photos from his travels around the world. In his recent posts, Durov appears with a full head of hair and a toned physique, often posing shirtless in various locations. However, these recent images stand in stark contrast to older photos where Durov was seen with a noticeably receding hairline.The drastic change in his appearance has fueled rumours that Durov may have undergone plastic surgery, including a possible hair transplant. A popular post on X (formerly Twitter) by a well-known account shared a side-by-side comparison of Durov's old and new photos, sparking a flurry of online discussions. The post reads, ""Pavel Durov (Telegram CEO) before his hair transplant and plastic surgery,"" and has since gone viral.The speculation around Durov's transformation has been met with a variety of opinions online. On Reddit, users have debated whether the changes in Durov's appearance are the result of surgical procedures or simply better grooming and styling.One Reddit user commented, ""This isn't a hair transplant. His hair is too thick and full to have this kind of drastic change from a HT. Most likely he's wearing a hair system (wig).""Another user added, ""There's speculation that it's not a transplant, but rather a hair system because his hair loss was much more advanced in the first picture, so when the operation happens, the resulting hairdo never looks as full as his.""Some users believe the changes are the result of plastic surgery, with one theorising, ""This is well-done surgery.""However, not everyone is convinced that surgery is involved. One Reddit user opined, ""Honestly, I think a lot of the facial 'changes' are simply due to the much better angle and lighting in the second photo.""As the speculation continues, it's clear that Durov's transformation—whether natural or assisted—has caught the public's eye. The intense scrutiny of his appearance highlights the challenges that come with being in the spotlight, especially for someone as private as Durov. Whether or not he has undergone any procedures, the discussions around his looks reflect a broader societal fascination with image and success.","Pavel Durov, 39, is the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali recently offered unconventional advice to star batter Babar Azam amid his ongoing struggles with form.In a candid statement on his YouTube channel, Basit urged Babar, 29, to consider marriage, suggesting it could be a transformative step in his life both on and off the field.""I know how a player feels when he is not performing well.I request Babar's parents to get him to marry,"" Basit said, emphasizing the emotional stability that marriage could bring.""Like an elder brother, I want to tell him, ‘Shaadi kar le bhai, ab umar zyada ho gayi hai teri’ (Get married, brother, you’re old enough now),"" Basit added, expressing his concern for Babar’s well-being and performance.This advice came after Babar's underwhelming performance in a Test series against Bangladesh. Despite his reputation as one of the world’s best batsmen, Babar has struggled in recent matches, managing just 31 and 11 runs in the second Test against Bangladesh.His prolonged slump, spanning 16 Test innings without a half-century, has raised alarm among fans and analysts alike.Basit's suggestion highlights the pressures top athletes face when they hit a rough patch, both mentally and emotionally.While unusual, his advice aims to address the psychological toll that prolonged poor form can take on a player. Marriage, according to Basit, could provide the emotional grounding that might help Babar rediscover his rhythm.As fans continue to debate the reasons behind Babar’s lean patch, Basit Ali’s comments have added an interesting twist to the conversation. Whether or not Babar takes this advice remains to be seen, but his next moves will surely be under the spotlight.","Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali has offered unconventional advice to star batter Babar Azam.
