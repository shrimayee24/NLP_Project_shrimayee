NEW DELHI: The ministry of home affairs on Thursday notified the schedule for upcoming houselisting and housing phase of Census 2027, replicating each of the 33 questions that were proposed to be asked in Census 2021 before the pandemic forced its postponement.The fields of information sought to be collected in the housing phase of Census, scheduled to be conducted between April 1 and Sept 30, include the building number; predominant material of floor, wall and roof of the census house; use of the census house and its condition; as well as household number.Information will have to be furnished on total number of persons residing in the household, name and sex of the head of the household; and if he/she belongs to the SC, ST or other category. Also included are fields pertaining to ownership status of the house; number of dwelling rooms in possession of the household; and number of married couples residing in the household.As regards amenities, respondents will need to apprise the census authority - either digitally through the census app or during the enumerator's visit - of the main source of drinking water, main source of lighting, access to and type of latrine, waste water outlet and availability of bathing facility.Information will also be sought on availability of LPG or CNG connection in the household and the main fuel used for cooking. Household amenities and facilities to be mapped shall include transistor, radio, TV, internet access, mobile phone or smartphone; and mode of transport. Respondents will also need to share details of the main cereal consumed in the household. The mobile number of the household (head or any other) will be collected but used only for census-related communications.The exercise will be spread over two phases, that is, houselisting and housing census to be conducted from April 1 to Sept 30, 2026, followed by population enumeration between from Feb 9 and Feb 28, 2027, with the 00:00 hours of March 1, 2027 being the reference date (except for Ladakh and snow-bound areas and non-synchronous areas of J&K, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand). The population enumeration phase will also capture caste, a first since the 1931 census.","Ministry of home affairs has notified the schedule for upcoming houselisting and housing phase of Census 2027.

You’re 'not addicted' to screen: What is doomscrolling and why it feels impossible to stop?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/youre-not-addicted-to-screen-what-is-doomscrolling-and-why-it-feels-impossible-to-stop/articleshow/127096913.cms,"Late-night scrolling through distressing news, known as doomscrolling, is a stress response, not a lack of discipline. Our brains, wired for survival, interpret constant negative information as a threat, leading to anxiety and sleep issues. Understanding this helps shift focus from self-blame to managing stress and practicing digital hygiene for peace

The impact of increased usage of social media

You are doomscrolling

News about violence, war, disasters, and crime

Political conflict and outrage

Social media arguments and abuse

Videos that trigger fear, anger, or helplessness

Endless updates that never seem to end

.

The survival instincts

Why it feels compulsive

Why has this become worse recently

.

Why saying 'just stop' doesn't work

The emotional cost

Understanding changes everything

Doomscrolling is a signal, not failure

It’s late at night. The house is quiet. You are tired but not sleepy. Your phone is already in your hand. You tell yourself you will just check one thing. One headline. One update.Thirty minutes pass. Then an hour.You feel worse than before. Your chest feels tight. Your mind is racing. You are angry, anxious, or numb. You put the phone down, but sleep still does not come easily.The next morning, you blame yourself.“I need better discipline.”“I should stop this habit.”“I am addicted.”Doomscrolling is the act of repeatedly consuming negative or distressing news online, even when it begins to affect your mood and mental state. It usually happens without planning. You open your phone to check one update, and then keep scrolling through bad news, angry posts, or frightening information long after it stops being useful.It usually includes:People often describe it as “mindless scrolling”. But it is not mindless at all. Your mind is actually very alert. Too alert. Doomscrolling happens when your brain believes there is danger and feels the need to stay informed to survive it.That is not laziness. That is not a lack of control. That is stress.When humans feel unsafe, the brain shifts into survival mode. This is not new. Long before phones existed, our brains were wired to scan the environment for threats, pay more attention to bad news than good, and remember danger more clearly than safety. This is how humans survived for thousands of years. When there was a threat nearby, knowing more meant staying alive.Today, the “threat” is no longer a wild animal or a nearby enemy. It is a constant stream of information telling us the world is unsafe. The brain cannot tell the difference between a real danger in front of you and repeated stories of danger on a screen. So it keeps scanning, keeps scrolling, and keeps looking for answers that never come.According to Medical News Today, a 2023 study found that people who already feel anxious about the future are more likely to engage in doomscrolling. A separate study published in 2024 suggested that the modern news media’s strong focus on negative events may fuel doomscrolling and deepen people’s existential worries.Doomscrolling often happens at night. That is when distractions are gone, the mind finally slows down, unprocessed stress surfaces, and phones become an easy way to avoid sitting with difficult thoughts.The brain chooses: “Let me focus on this external crisis instead of my own anxiety.” But this keeps the nervous system active when it needs rest. That is why sleep feels harder after scrolling, not easier.People often say, “I don’t even enjoy it. I don’t know why I keep scrolling.” That confusion comes from misunderstanding what is happening. Doomscrolling is not about pleasure. It is about control.When things feel uncertain, the brain wants more information to reduce that uncertainty. It believes that if it knows more, it can prepare.But modern news and social media do not offer closure. They offer endless updates. There is no clear ending.No final answer. No moment where the brain feels safe enough to stop.So the scrolling continues.Not because you want to.Because your brain thinks it has to.Doomscrolling existed before smartphones. People always worried about the news. But it became far more intense because of three things:24/7 news cycles: There is no pause anymore. No morning paper, no evening bulletin. Bad news updates arrive at all hours.Social media algorithms:Platforms push content that triggers strong emotions. Fear and anger keep people engaged longer.Global uncertainty: Pandemics, wars, economic stress, climate anxiety, political instability. Many people feel the future is unpredictable.The phenomenon of doomscrolling named one of the Oxford English Dictionary’s words of the year in 2020 became widely recognised during the pandemic, when disrupted daily routines drove people to constantly check updates on Covid 19 cases and deaths.When stress becomes constant, the brain stays in survival mode for longer. Doomscrolling is one result of that.If doomscrolling were just a habit, simple advice would work. “Put your phone away”, “Have self-control"", “Do a digital detox”. But most people have tried these things. They may work for a day. Or a week. Then the scrolling returns.That is because stress responses cannot be switched off with willpower alone. Telling someone under stress to “just stop” is like telling someone anxious to “just calm down”. It sounds logical. It feels dismissive. And it often increases shame. Shame makes stress worse. And stress fuels doomscrolling.According to Psychology Today, young adults often find it especially hard to put their phones down. This is partly because the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that helps with impulse control and decision-making, is still developing during this stage of life. As a result, breaking cycles like doomscrolling becomes more difficult.Dr. Manoj Kumar Sharma, a clinical psychologist and coordinator of NIMHANS' SHUT Clinic, co-authored studies that observed that during Covid‑19, compulsive “doomsurfing” and “doomscrolling,” driven by cognitive biases and poor mood regulation, led to anxiety, sleep problems, low motivation, and distress, highlighting the need for digital hygiene and offline coping strategies.Doomscrolling slowly changes how you feel about the world and yourself. People report feeling constantly on edge, angry at strangers, emotionally exhausted, hopeless about the future, guilty for not “doing enough” or numb to real joy.This happens because the brain is not designed to process suffering at a global scale every day. Seeing pain without the ability to act creates helplessness. Helplessness is deeply stressful. Over time, the nervous system stays activated even when there is no immediate danger.Doomscrolling is also often a sign of care. This part is important. Many people who doomscroll care deeply. They care about injustice, they care about others. Their scrolling is not apathy. It is concern without an outlet. But caring without boundaries becomes emotional overload. And the brain responds by staying alert instead of resting.Mayo Clinic Press talks about checking your mood while scrolling, setting time limits, and using reminders to manage screen time.When you understand that doomscrolling is a stress response, your relationship with it changes. You stop asking:“What is wrong with me?” And start asking: “What am I reacting to?” This shift matters. Because you cannot heal what you keep blaming.The first step is not cutting down screen time. The first step is recognising stress. Ask yourself: What am I worried about right now? What feels uncertain in my life? What am I trying to prepare for? You may not have clear answers. That is okay. The goal is not solutions. It is awareness. When the brain feels seen, it does not need to shout as loudly.Instead of forcing control, support regulation.Your scrolling is telling you something. It is saying: “I am overwhelmed.” “I am trying to understand.”“I do not feel safe enough to rest.” Listen to that message instead of fighting it.The goal is not to become uninformed. It is to become regulated. You can care without drowning. You can stay aware without staying anxious.If you are doomscrolling, you are not broken. You are responding to a world that feels heavy. Your brain is doing what it was designed to do — protect you. But protection should not come at the cost of peace.Be gentle with yourself. Lower the noise where you can. Rest is not ignorance. It is survival too. And sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is put the phone down and choose to breathe.","Late-night scrolling through distressing news is a stress response, not a lack of discipline.

India has a river that flows backwards: Know which river it is,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/travel/india-has-a-river-that-flows-backwards-know-which-river-it-is/articleshow/126525975.cms,"The Narmada river flows in the opposite direction and here’s why

The origin of the Narmada River

The reason why the Narmada flow westwards

What landscapes does the river support

Dams and projects that lie on the river

Natural sites found along the Narmada

Narmada and its importance for faith and culture





India’s river systems are usually described as following a clear pattern. Most major rivers rise in the Himalayas or the central highlands and travel eastward to the Bay of Bengal, a rule taught early in geography lessons and seldom challenged. Yet one notable river defies this logic. Flowing westward across the subcontinent, it reshapes landscapes, livelihoods, and belief systems along its course. Far from obscure or insignificant, this river is long, deeply revered, and extensively studied, though its direction often surprises first-time learners. The Narmada stands apart not for its size or speed alone, but because its westward journey is dictated by geology rather than convention.The Narmada is the river that flows west instead of east. It is the fifth-longest river in India, spanning around 1,310 kilometres. The Narmada River does not empty into the Bay of Bengal like the Ganga or Godavari do. It travels steadily westward from its source until it eventually reaches the Arabian Sea. The Tapi is another prominent example of the few big Indian rivers that follow this path. The idea that the Narmada runs ""backwards"" originates from the fact that the majority of the region's rivers flow in the opposite direction, eastward.The Narmada River begins near Amarkantak, Madhya Pradesh. The location is forested and serves as a pilgrimage site. From here, the river begins to move westward. It runs across Madhya Pradesh, briefly crosses Maharashtra, and finally enters Gujarat. Its trip ends near Bharuch, where it enters the Arabian Sea. The river's character alters as it travels. In some areas, it cuts through hills and small valleys, but in others, it spreads out and slows. The upper stretches feel isolated, whereas the lower ones feel settled.Geology shapes the Narmada's flow direction. It flows across a rift valley caused by previous tectonic action. The valley slopes east to west. Water follows the slope. The Vindhya Range sits to the north of the basin, while the Satpura Range extends to the south. Because the river passes through this gap, it behaves differently than many others. It does not form a wide delta. Instead, it creates an estuary where it joins the sea.The Narmada basin covers varied terrain. The upper areas are hilly and forested, with fewer people living nearby. Further west, the land becomes flatter and more open. These plains are fertile. Farming depends heavily on the river here. Crops such as wheat, pulses, and cotton are common. The river also supplies drinking water. Over time, canals and reservoirs have extended its reach. Towns and cities along the river rely on it in quiet, everyday ways.Several large dams have been built along the Narmada. The Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat is the most widely known. Others include the Indira Sagar Dam and the Omkareshwar Dam in Madhya Pradesh. These projects generate electricity and supply water for farming and households. They have also changed how the river flows. Over the years, they have been linked to debates about land, displacement, and environmental impact. These discussions continue.The river is also associated with well-known natural features. Near Jabalpur, it passes between tall marble cliffs known as the Marble Rocks. Close by, there is Dhuandhar Falls that send water crashing down in a thick spray, especially during the monsoon. Although these places are not vast, they leave an impression. The river here feels contained. The sound carries. The landscape holds it in place.For numerous individuals, the Narmada signifies more than merely a river. Temples in Maheshwar, Omkareshwar, and Amarkantak attract pilgrims year-round. Some individuals undertake the Narmada Parikrama, an extensive pilgrimage along its banks. The river is regarded as a living entity. Its trajectory has remained consistent across generations. Throughout its extent, faith, establishment, and customary practices persist in expanding around it.","The Narmada is the fifth-longest river in India, spanning around 1,310 kilometres.

The world’s largest beaver dam is so big that you can see it from space,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/the-worlds-largest-beaver-dam-is-so-big-that-you-can-see-it-from-space/articleshow/126520430.cms,"AI-generated

A beaver dam hidden in Canada is clearly visible from space

The actual size of the beaver dam is impressive

This beaver dam was discovered from space

Why beavers build on this scale

What the dam means for the wider park





Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada, which includes northern Alberta and parts of the Northwest Territories, is home to the largest beaver dam ever documented. The structure is located deep within the park, far from roads, towns, and established paths, making it inaccessible by foot. It is so large that it can be seen in satellite photographs from orbit. The dam is approximately 775 metres long at its front edge and spans an area of around 70,000 square metres, keeping back a substantial volume of water. It was initially discovered in 2007 using satellite imaging rather than terrestrial exploration. Further investigation revealed that the dam did not exist before 1980, implying that it was developed over several decades by multiple generations of beavers operating in the same spot.Wood Buffalo National Park spans northern Alberta and parts of the Northwest Territories. It is Canada's largest national park and among the world's largest protected places. The beaver dam is located deep within it, far from roads, cities, and recognised trails.Walking to the place would take several days. The terrain is challenging and slow. Wetlands extend over large distances. Muskeg collapses under weight.The boreal forest closes in densely. Most people who saw the dam up close did not walk there. They arrived on private sightseeing planes, looking down rather than approaching on the ground.According to Parks Canada , from end to end, the front of the dam measures roughly 775 metres. That is close to seven football fields laid side by side. The entire perimeter of the dam area approaches 2,000 metres. Its surface area covers about 70,000 square metres.The pond created behind the dam is thought to be around one metre deep. That would place the volume of water at roughly 70,000 cubic metres. Another way to see it is through scale. A standard dump truck carries about 10 cubic yards. By that measure, the dam holds back the equivalent of more than 90,000 dump trucks of water. Seen as ice, it would fill around 1,600 hockey rinks.According to BBC Wildlife , no explorer stumbled across this dam by chance. No ranger logged it during patrol. It was first noticed in 2007, not on the ground, but in satellite imagery. The structure was large enough to be visible from space.Further images, including those provided by NASA, showed that the dam did not exist before 1980. That suggests it could be up to 45 years old. Over that time, it grew slowly, piece by piece, shaped by water flow and repeated work rather than a single effort. The location helped keep it hidden. With no nearby access routes, there was little reason for people to pass through.Beavers are often described as ecosystem engineers. They change landscapes by design, even if that design follows instinct rather than a plan. By felling trees and packing wood, mud, stones, and vegetation together, they redirect water and create ponds.In the case of this dam, multiple generations of beavers worked on the same structure. Each added material where it was needed. Over time, the dam expanded and strengthened, holding back runoff from the Birch Mountains at the southern edge of the park. The result is not just a barrier but an entire water system shaped by animals rather than machines.Wood Buffalo National Park is known for more than its size. It supports wood bison, whooping cranes, and the Peace Athabasca Delta, one of the largest inland freshwater deltas in the world. The beaver dam fits quietly into that setting.It supports wetlands, slows water movement, and creates habitat for other species. It does not draw crowds or require fences. It simply exists, doing its work out of sight. Even now, most people will never see it directly. The dam remains where it was built, surrounded by forest and water, changing its corner of the park a little at a time.","The beaver dam is located in Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada.

“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work”

Who was Thomas Alva Edison



What this Thomas Edison quote means



“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.”

Why this quote still matters



How people relate to it today







People remember Thomas A. Edison as one of the most important inventors. He worked on a lot of ideas and had thousands of patents over the course of his life. Many of his inventions are now a part of daily life, like the electric light bulb and sound recording devices. But Edison was known for more than just what he made. People also knew how he thought about work, hard work, and success., is one of the most popular things he has said. Edison talks about a simple habit that a lot of people have. People often look for opportunities in things that seem fun, easy, or rewarding right away. It's easier to ignore something when it looks hard or requires a lot of work. Edison thought this was where a lot of people went wrong. He says that opportunities don't usually come in a polished or attractive way. Instead, it often comes in a quiet way that looks like work that needs to be done.Thomas Alva Edison was born in 1847 in the US. He was curious about how things worked from a young age. As he got older, this curiosity turned into a habit of trying new things and making old ones better. Edison worked on many projects at once and thought that progress came from working hard over and over again instead of getting quick results.Some of the most important things he invented were the electric light bulb, phonograph, and the motion picture camera. He also built labs where groups of people could work together on long-term experiments. Edison thought that being patient, testing things out, and working hard every day were all important parts of coming up with new ideas. A lot of historical records say that he saw innovation as a normal part of his job, not a flash of genius.Edison said,He was using a simple picture to explain a common reaction. Overalls are clothes that people wear to do physical or practical work. Edison used this picture to show that opportunities often seem normal and hard to get.A lot of people think that success will come quickly or with little work. They might want results right away, without having to learn, practice, or fail along the way. Edison said that real opportunities usually require work first and pay off later. Because of this, people sometimes miss out on chances that could have helped them grow.This idea is still important because it shows how people make choices every day. Students might not want to study subjects that need more practice. Workers might not want to do tasks that seem hard. People may put off their personal goals if they seem hard or uncertain. Edison's words remind readers that trying hard doesn't mean you've failed; it usually means that something important is possible.The quote tells people to think about work in a new way. Instead of viewing work as a hindrance, it proposes perceiving it as an integral component of the opportunity.This quote is often used in classrooms, offices, and talks about how to grow as a person. Teachers use it to show how important it is to be consistent. Employers share it to show that hard work pays off in the long run. People think about it when they are deciding whether or not to take on tasks that need a lot of patience.Edison's words still ring true because they describe a reality that many people know. At first, opportunities may not seem appealing, but those who are willing to put in the work often reap the benefits in the end.","Thomas Alva Edison was one of the most important inventors of the 20th century.

Artificial intelligence is no longer something people only argue about in tech conferences or future forecasts. It is already quietly shaping daily life in profound and often unexpected ways. From customer support chats to recommendation engines, from coding tools to medical research, AI is now part of how work gets done efficiently. And according to Bill Gates , the pace of change is about to speed up even more dramatically.In his latest annual letter, The Year Ahead, the Microsoft co-founder lays out a clear message. AI will reshape society, economies, and jobs faster than most people expect. Gates says he remains optimistic about technology, but this time his optimism comes with serious warnings. The benefits are real. So are the risks. And ignoring either would be a grave mistake.Gates has spent decades watching technology alter economies and daily life. In his letter, he says AI is different from past waves of innovation. Not just faster, but broader. He argues that artificial intelligence could affect more parts of society than any previous human-made tool.He points to progress already happening. AI is accelerating disease research, improving climate modelling, and expanding access to digital education.Tasks that once took years can now be completed in months, sometimes weeks. For Gates, this is proof that AI can solve hard problems if used well.But he also stresses that hope alone is not a strategy. Institutions, governments, and workers are not fully prepared for how quickly these changes are arriving. Without planning, the speed of AI adoption could leave many people behind.One of Gates’ biggest concerns is how AI could be misused. As advanced tools become more accessible, the barrier to harmful use drops. He has warned that open-source AI systems could be exploited by bad actors, including non-state groups.In particular, Gates has raised alarms about biological threats. He suggests that AI-assisted misuse could pose risks even greater than naturally occurring pandemics. That is not a casual statement. It reflects a growing fear among researchers that powerful tools, in the wrong hands, could scale harm faster than ever before.Gates argues that global cooperation is essential. Clear rules, oversight, and governance structures are needed. At the same time, he acknowledges the tension. Too many restrictions could slow beneficial innovation. Too little could invite danger. Finding the balance will not be easy.Jobs sit at the centre of Gates’ warning. He says AI makes it possible to produce more goods and services with less human labour. That reality will change how companies hire and how work is valued.Some of this is already visible. In software development, AI tools help programmers write, test, and maintain code faster. Gates notes that developers can now be significantly more productive, which lowers costs and reshapes team structures.He also points to sectors like warehouse operations and phone-based customer service. As AI systems improve, these roles are likely to face pressure. Automation will not arrive all at once, but it will arrive steadily.Gates does not frame this as doom. He frames it as a disruption that needs preparation.Beyond job losses, Bill Gates talks about how work itself might change. If AI boosts productivity enough, shorter workweeks could become possible. The same output, fewer hours. It sounds appealing. But he is careful not to present it as automatic.Whether these gains benefit most people depends on policy choices. Who owns the productivity gains. How companies share them. Without thoughtful decisions, Gates warns that efficiency could concentrate wealth instead of spreading it.This is where governments and institutions matter. AI alone will not deliver fairness. People have to decide what to do with the gains it creates.","Bill Gates says AI will reshape society, economies, and jobs faster than most people expect.

Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok banned from generating sexualised images,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-ai-chatbot-grok-banned-from-generating-sexualised-images/articleshow/126537596.cms,"In response to mounting backlash and regulatory scrutiny, Grok AI has ceased the creation of explicit images of real individuals. xAI has introduced stringent technical measures to curb misuse, particularly addressing concerns around deepfake content involving women and minors. Furthermore, image generation and editing services are now reserved for paid X subscribers, with geoblocking mechanisms implemented to filter illegal material.

We also report accounts seeking Child Sexual Exploitation materials to law enforcement authorities as necessary.

Updates to [@]Grok Account

We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis.

This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.

Additionally, image creation and the ability to edit images via the Grok account on the X platform are now only available to paid subscribers. This adds an extra layer of protection by helping to ensure that individuals who attempt to abuse the Grok account to violate the law or our policies can be held accountable.

Grok AI restricts image editing features to paid X users

Elon Musk warns, ‘Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will …’





Grok the AI chatbot of Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence firm xAI will no longer be able to generate sexualised or revealing images of real people. The company took this decision after the mounting criticism and regulatory scrutiny. In a post blog post share on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the company company confirmed that it has implemented technological measures in to order to prevent Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people.

The Tesla CEO was responding to a post on “inappropriate images” generated by grok.DogeDesigner, followed by Elon Musk wrote in the post: “Some people are saying Grok is creating inappropriate images.

All is not well between Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Meta's highest-paid employee as the company's new reporting structure shows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/all-is-not-well-between-meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-and-metas-highest-paid-employee-as-the-companys-new-reporting-structure-shows/articleshow/126526041.cms,"Meta's new reporting structure reveals friction between Mark Zuckerberg and Alexandr Wang, his $14 billion hire. Wang finds Zuckerberg's micromanagement suffocating, while staff question his leadership of Meta's AI ambitions. A recent restructuring centralizes infrastructure decisions above Wang, indicating Zuckerberg's desire for tighter control over the company's significant AI investments.

Wang's inexperience becomes liability for Mark Zuckerberg as AI race intensifies

Meta reorganizes infrastructure chain of command above Wang





Meta's newest reporting structure is exposing something leadership has tried to hide—friction between CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his highest-paid employee, Alexandr Wang. Multiple sources close to the company reveal that Wang, the 28-year-old founder Zuckerberg recruited for $14 billion, finds the CEO's hands-on management suffocating. At the same time, current staff question whether Wang has the chops to lead Meta's $600 billion AI bet.The tension surfaced this fall during a crucial meeting. Wang's TBD Lab team and longtime executives Chris Cox and Andrew Bosworth clashed over strategy. Cox and Bosworth wanted Wang's new AI model trained on Instagram and Facebook data to boost the company's core advertising business. Wang pushed back hard. He argued the goal should be catching up to OpenAI and Google's models first, worrying that customizing training for product tasks would slow progress.It's an us-versus-them mentality that's become impossible to ignore inside Meta. Wang's researchers view the old guard as mere product managers stuck in the social media era. They're chasing superintelligence while everyone else cares about feeds and ads. Some staff even questioned whether $2 billion was quietly shifted from Bosworth's Reality Labs budget to Wang's team—though Meta's spokesperson denied the figure, the whispers persist.The cracks widened when Yann LeCun, Meta's legendary AI scientist and a Turing Award winner, bolted in November rather than report to Wang. Sources say LeCun bristled at serving under someone whose background was data labeling, not cutting-edge AI research. Before that, Nat Friedman, another big hire, faced pressure to move faster. The rushed launch of Vibes, Meta's AI video feed, frustrated his team who felt forced to compete with OpenAI's Sora before they were ready.Wang told associates that Zuckerberg's micromanagement feels suffocating. Yet here's the irony—Zuckerberg hired him specifically because he needed someone he could control, someone young and ambitious enough to execute his vision of ""personal superintelligence."" The CEO's reputation for obsessing over chosen projects means TBD Lab gets his undivided attention. That laser focus looks less like support and more like surveillance, the report said.This week, Zuckerberg announced Meta Compute, a new top-level initiative reporting directly to him. He's putting Santosh Janardhan and Daniel Gross in charge, with Dina Powell McCormick handling government relations. The move effectively centralizes infrastructure decisions above Wang, suggesting Zuckerberg wants tighter control as Meta burns through billions. If Wang thought he had autonomy, this announcement proved otherwise. The company's trajectory suggests Zuckerberg's betting everything on AI—and he's not delegating that to a 28-year-old anymore.The restructuring carries real risks. Wang's TBD Lab only lost two researchers during their first vesting period in November, suggesting the team still has some loyalty. But the organizational shuffle sends a message that nobody—not even the $14 billion hire—operates without Zuckerberg's constant oversight. Scale AI, the startup Zuckerberg invested in to poach Wang, is already losing credibility in the market. Private investors have slashed its valuation from $29 billion to as low as $7.3 billion. If Wang's leadership at Meta falters, it raises uncomfortable questions: did Zuckerberg overpay for the wrong person, or is he simply incapable of trusting anyone with real power?","Alexandr Wang, Meta's highest-paid employee, finds Mark Zuckerberg's hands-on management suffocating.

Wordle arrives each morning without much ceremony, yet it still asks for attention. Wordle consists of one word, five letters, and a small grid that continuously fills and empties. Some days pass quickly. Others do not. Today’s puzzle sits somewhere in between, with early guesses offering hints but little comfort. The game remains unchanged, but habits form around it, coffee cooling nearby, phones tilted just enough. Colour feedback nudges choices rather than explaining them, and progress feels indirect. Players often circle the answer without realising it. January 22 brings another of these quiet tests. It does not shout its difficulty. Instead, it waits. A few sensible guesses help. Rushing usually fails. Today, players must approach the solution carefully, letter by letter.Wordle challenges players to uncover a hidden five-letter word in six attempts. After each guess, tiles change colour to show how close you are.Using this feedback to refine each new guess is the core of the game.If today’s puzzle is proving stubborn, these clues focus on structure rather than spelling.They are intended to guide rather than solve.Reviewing eliminated letters and leaning on common consonants may help reduce the remaining options and bring the solution into view.The answer to Wordle #1678 on January 22, 2026, is:Meaning: To make a slight, sharp sound, as of glasses striking togetherWhether you solved it on your first guess or needed a few clues, Wordle remains a fun way to sharpen your mind every day. Come back tomorrow for fresh hints and another word challenge.","Wordle challenges players to uncover a hidden five-letter word in six attempts.

No outdoor loudspeakers this Ramadan: Saudi Ministry issues clear mosque rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/no-outdoor-loudspeakers-this-ramadan-saudi-ministry-issues-clear-mosque-rules/articleshow/127232745.cms,"No outdoor loudspeakers this Ramadan/Representative Image

Outdoor loudspeakers restricted to Adhan and Iqama





Circular outlines Ramadan mosque preparations





Iftar arrangements and facility readiness









As Ramadan approaches, Saudi authorities have reaffirmed strict rules governing mosque operations, with a renewed focus on sound discipline, prayer timing, and preparations for worshippers. The measures are intended to preserve the sanctity of prayers while ensuring comfort, order, and consideration for surrounding communities during the holy month.Minister of Islamic Affairs, Call and Guidance Sheikh Abdullatif Al-Sheikh confirmed that mosques across the Kingdom will not be allowed to use external loudspeakers during prayers throughout Ramadan. He clarified that outdoor speakers may be used only for the Adhan, the call to prayer, and the iqama, the second call that signals the start of congregational worship.The restriction applies to all prayers during the fasting month and is aimed at maintaining calm during worship, while limiting noise beyond mosque premises.The announcement followed the release of a circular by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Call and Guidance on Tuesday, setting out detailed instructions for mosque readiness ahead of Ramadan.The circular stressed strict adherence to official prayer times in accordance with the Umm Al-Qura calendar.It specifically highlighted the importance of calling the Isha prayer at its designated time and observing the prescribed duration between the Adhan and the iqama for each prayer.Mosques were instructed to organise iftar meals only in designated courtyard areas. The ministry also emphasised the responsible management of water donations to meet mosque requirements, while discouraging the accumulation of large quantities in storage facilities.Relevant departments were directed to strengthen the work of mosque caretakers and maintenance teams to ensure that facilities are clean, safe, and fully prepared for Ramadan. Particular attention was placed on women’s prayer areas, which the ministry said must receive the same level of care and readiness as other sections of mosques.According to the ministry, the guidelines are designed to ensure that worshippers experience a high level of organisation and care throughout Ramadan. Officials said the measures aim to create a calm, orderly, and spiritually enriching environment inside mosques, while also maintaining respect for nearby residential areas during one of the busiest periods of the Islamic calendar.","Saudi authorities have reaffirmed strict rules governing mosque operations.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

UAE weather today

Is it really going to rain?

Road safety alerts

Stay Updated: Monitor the NCM’s ""Red"" and ""Yellow"" alerts before heading out on long drives.

Drive Cautiously: Be prepared for sudden fog patches on major highways like E11 and E311.

Outdoor Prep: If you’re planning a desert camp, ensure your gear is moisture-resistant to handle the damp morning air.





After weeks of clear, dry skies, the UAE is bracing for a change in pace as a weak low-pressure system moves in from the east.According to the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM), residents can expect a shift toward more unsettled conditions starting Friday, January 23, 2026.While the weather today remains fair to partly cloudy, a layer of cloud cover is gradually building up, signaling the arrival of a more humid and ""unpredictable"" stretch of the winter season.This atmospheric disturbance, influenced by a similar weak system in the upper atmosphere, means the desert's typical golden sunshine will be shared with patches of grey.While no severe storms are on the horizon, the pattern brings a welcome variety to the season, making it the perfect time to enjoy the outdoors before the humidity levels spike overnight.If you’ve been waiting for a reason to use your umbrella, the weeknd might provide a light opportunity. The NCM has indicated that cloud cover will increase further by Saturday night and Sunday, particularly over coastal and northern areas.There is a tangible chance of light rainfall during this period, especially over the islands and coastal regions.Temperatures are varying significantly depending on where you are in the country.Coastal areas like Dubai and Abu Dhabi are seeing pleasant highs of 19°C to 24°C, while internal regions might hit 25°C.However, the real ""winter"" is happening in the mountains, where daytime temperatures struggle to pass 16°C and nighttime lows have been recorded as low as 5°C to 9°C.Earlier this week, Jebel Jais even recorded a seasonal low of 0.2°C, proving that the UAE's winter ""nip"" is very real.Yes, but rainfall today is more likely to be light rather than heavy. The NCM’s forecast indicates that scattered showers might develop, especially over northern emirates and along the coast.In recent days, light rain has already been observed in parts of the country, and temperatures dipped slightly, a pattern consistent with weak cloud systems passing through.This does not currently suggest widespread storms or heavy downpours, just a gentle wetting rain that may interrupt outdoor plans briefly.One of the most immediate impacts of this weather shift is the rising humidity.Forecasters expect humidity to surge overnight and into Saturday morning, particularly in western areas.This increase often leads to mist or fog formation during the early hours, which can significantly reduce visibility for morning commuters.To ensure a safe weekend, residents are encouraged to:This change in weather serves as a reminder of the unique beauty of a UAE winter. For many, the arrival of clouds and light drizzle is a celebrated event, signaling the peak of ""Karak tea season"" and outdoor gatherings.While the seas remain generally calm to moderate in the Arabian Gulf, the refreshing winds, reaching up to 35 km/h, add a crisp feel to the air.Whether the rain hits your neighborhood or just teases from the clouds, it’s a time to wrap up warm and enjoy the rarest of desert sights: a rainy day in the Emirates.","The UAE is bracing for a change in pace as a weak low-pressure system moves in from the east.

Govt Sends Notice To Elon Musk's X On Grok AI Chatbot Misuse, IT Ministry Seeks Action Report





Elon Musk’s AI chatbot, Grok, created and then publicly shared at least 1.8 million sexualised images of women, according to separate estimates of X data by the New York Times and the Center for Countering Digital Hate.Starting in late Dec, users on the social media platform inundated the chatbot’s X account with requests to alter real photos of women and children to remove their clothes, put them in bikinis and pose them in sexual positions, prompting a global outcry from victims and regulators.In just nine days, Grok posted more than 4.4 million images. A review by NYT conservatively estimated that at least 41% of posts, or 1.8 million, most likely contained sexualised imagery of women. A broader analysis by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, using a statistical model, estimated that 65%, or over three million, contained sexualised imagery of men, women or kids.The findings show how quickly Grok spread disturbing images, which earlier prompted govts in Britain, India, Malaysia and the US to start investigations into whether the images violated local laws. “This is industrial-scale abuse of women and girls,” said Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which conducts research on online hate and disinformation.“There have been nudifying tools, but they have never had the distribution, ease of use or the integration into a large platform that Elon Musk did with Grok. ”X and Musk’s AI start-up, xAI, which owns X and makes Grok, did not respond to requests for comment. The interest in Grok’s image-editing abilities exploded on Dec 31, when Musk shared a photo generated by the chatbot of himself in a bikini, as well as a SpaceX rocket with a woman’s undressed body superimposed on top. The chatbot has a public account on X, where users can ask it questions or request alterations to images. Users flocked to the social media site, in many cases asking Grok to remove clothing in images of women and kids, after which the bot publicly posted the AI-generated images.On Jan 8, X limited Grok’s AI image creation to users who pay for some premium features, significantly reducing the number of images.Last week, X expanded those guardrails, saying it would no longer allow anyone to prompt Grok’s X account for “images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis.” Since then, Grok has largely ignored requests to dress women in bikinis, but has created images of them in leotards. The curbs did not extend to Grok’s app or website, which continue to allow users to generate sexual content in private.","Elon Musk’s AI chatbot, Grok, created and then publicly shared at least 1.8 million sexualised images of women.

A Kansas City man is facing major legal trouble after prosecutors accused him of running a Facebook Marketplace scam in which vehicles were sold to multiple buyers and then stolen back within a day. Authorities say Mamadou Diallo used forged paperwork to make the deals look legitimate, convincing victims to hand over thousands of dollars before the cars disappeared from their driveways. The case has gone viral online, with many reacting in disbelief at how the same pattern reportedly played out again and again across at least eight separate sales.Police reports say the seller listed cars for sale on Facebook Marketplace and met buyers in person to complete the transactions. Buyers believed they were purchasing legally owned vehicles after being given documents that appeared to include valid titles and bills of sale.Within hours, and often within 24 hours, the vehicles were reported stolen, leaving the new owners with no car and no money back.Investigators say the cases followed a repeated pattern across multiple transactions. Buyers purchased either a 2013 grey Honda Civic or a 2013 brown Buick Verano, only for the same vehicle to show up again in another sale soon after.In one reported case, a car was taken back in as little as seven hours, with a theft captured on home CCTV during the early morning.Diallo now faces 14 felony counts, including:If convicted on all counts, he could face up to 98 years in prison, showing how seriously prosecutors are treating the repeated fraud and vehicle theft accusations.Police records link the incidents to May and June 2025, when Kansas City Police received multiple stolen vehicle reports connected to Facebook Marketplace purchases. Investigators later matched the cases based on similarities in listings, vehicles, and paperwork.The charges were announced in January 2026.The story exploded online after being shared widely on X, drawing millions of views. Many users joked that the scheme sounded like an “infinite money glitch” and compared it to Wall Street-style tactics, while others questioned whether the possible sentence is too harsh for a non-violent crime.The case has renewed concerns about the risks of peer-to-peer online sales, especially when large amounts of money exchange hands quickly. Unlike dealership purchases, private sales rely heavily on trust and paperwork, and forged documents can be difficult to detect on the spot.Experts often recommend buyers take extra precautions before paying for a vehicle, including:The case is now being viewed as a cautionary example of how quickly an online deal can turn into an expensive mistake.","Mamadou Diallo is accused of running a Facebook Marketplace scam in which vehicles were sold to multiple buyers and then stolen back within a day.

Why hundreds of bald eagles are flocking to northern British Columbia’s frozen mountains during winter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/why-hundreds-of-bald-eagles-are-flocking-to-northern-british-columbias-frozen-mountains-during-winter/articleshow/126672217.cms,"Source: X

Why British Columbia’s winter landscapes draw bald eagles together



Bald eagles and rare winter group behaviour



What winter eagle gatherings reveal to scientists







In the frozen mountains of northern British Columbia, there was the unusual occurrence of a rare incident in the wildlife scene where the bald eagles were gathered in their hundreds in one spot, and in the middle of winter. Against the background of mountains laden with snow and the icy river valley, the sight was quite outstanding and unusual. For bald eagles, which stand out in their status as symbols of freedom, power, and dominance in nature, it was highly unusual for them to congregate in such huge numbers because they were predominantly lone animals and territorial in their behaviour patterns. The severity of the weather seemed to have had a huge effect on the eagles, as only limited spaces were available and where their feeds were still accessible, forcing unprecedented gatherings that stunned researchers and local communities alike. Such rare congregations offer scientists valuable insight into how climate stress reshapes wildlife behaviour and survival strategies.The northern area of British Columbia is important to the wintering survival of bald eagles. Though much of this area will freeze, there will always be fast-moving rivers that are partially open, providing the eagles with readily available fish. Rivers that support salmon are usually connected, forming pathways to life-sustaining riverways.As winter approaches and the temperature cools, bald eagles from an increasingly vast area will migrate to these feeding grounds, and many will be seen in one small area.The harsh environment imposed by winter causes a shift in bald eagles' normal habits. The immobility brought by snow, the uninhabitability of lakes due to ice, and the shorter daylight hours make energy conservation essential. The habit of securing territories disappears, with eagles seeking locations close to food sources. The movement of prey through the snow-covered environment is predictable, helping the eagles modify their hunting patterns. What seems like a rare concentration of birds is, in actual fact, a decision based on survival that is influenced by the environment.In areas outside breeding colonies or feeding grounds, however, bald eagles tend to be alone. Adults do not compete with each other, particularly around feeding areas. To witness so many of them assemble at one place is a clear indication that their social norms have been temporarily overlooked. Experts say that it is possible only in areas where food is plentiful and accessible. In such areas, even though competition may be a disadvantage, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to observe their flexibility in handling their socialisation.The group behaviours exhibited during winter are very advantageous in several ways. The eagles can view each other in search of food, thus saving time looking for it in the frozen land. Additionally, the dominant eagles will either jump over the ice or find a source of food first as an indirect means of providing for the rest of the group members. The younger and weaker eagles are able to get protection by staying in a group, thus minimising the chances of starvation.Large winter gatherings offer a unique opportunity to study bald eagles under environmental stress. Scientists are able to estimate population size, age structure, feeding patterns, and social tolerance. It helps them to get an idea about the resiliency of the species towards extreme weather and habitat pressure. This kind of data is very crucial in view of changing climatic cycles that disturb food availability and migration behaviour in an ecosystem.The sight of hundreds of eagles in one place often plays the role of a sign of ecological vigour: healthy fish populations, undisrupted waterways, and preserved forest habitats. These aggregations are the natural barometers by which environmental health is spotlighted, emphasising those areas where ecosystems are healthy and working.","The sight of hundreds of bald eagles in one place in British Columbia stunned researchers and local communities.

UAE child digital safety law 2026

Ensuring children only use apps and games suited for their specific age group.



Utilizing parental control tools to block access to adult or harmful materials.



Preventing children from sharing sensitive personal data or the private information of others.



Reporting any digital threats or grooming attempts to the relevant UAE authorities immediately.

Fines for neglect



Looking ahead





In a groundbreaking move to protect the youngest members of society, the UAE has officially enacted the Child Digital Safety Law, a regulation that shifts the focus of online safety from tech companies directly to the home.Under this new legal framework, parents and legal guardians are now held legally accountable for the digital footprints and online activities of their children. This isn't just a set of guidelines; it is a formal recognition that the virtual world is as significant as the physical one.The United Arab Emirates has issued a new Federal Decree-Law on Child Digital Safety aimed at protecting children from online risks and harmful digital experiences. This law took effect on January 1, 2026 and represents one of the most comprehensive approaches to child online protection in the region. It applies not only to digital platforms but also to parents, caregivers and internet service providers.The move is part of the UAE’s broader strategy to make 2026 the “Year of the Family”, putting children’s well-being at the centre of digital policy and safety initiatives. The law outlines specific ""Digital Due Diligence"" that parents are expected to follow.It moves beyond simply checking a child's browser history and enters the realm of active prevention.Guardians are now required to ensure that children are not accessing age-inappropriate platforms, particularly social media apps that have strict 13+ or 16+ age limits. Parents must monitor for signs of cyber-harassment and take immediate action if their child is being targeted or, conversely, if their child is engaging in bullying behavior toward others.Key responsibilities under the new law include:Under the Federal Decree-Law No. 26 of 2025 on Child Digital Safety, the UAE has established a strict penalty structure to ensure that the ""Digital Due Diligence"" is taken seriously. While the law is currently in a grace period for full operational compliance, the legal framework for fines is already clear.Parents and guardians found in significant breach of their monitoring duties, such as allowing children under 13 to bypass age restrictions or ignoring evidence of digital grooming, face administrative fines that typically begin at AED 5,000 for initial instances of neglect.For more severe cases, the law integrates with the existing Wadeema Law, where ""digital abandonment"" can lead to much steeper financial hits. If a child’s safety is directly compromised due to a lack of parental oversight, fines can reach up to AED 50,000 to AED 100,000.Furthermore, repeat offenders or those who intentionally facilitate a child's access to harmful content may see these amounts doubled. Beyond just the money, the law empowers courts to mandate ""digital rehabilitation"" courses for parents, ensuring they gain the technical skills needed to protect their families moving forward.Staying on the right side of the law begins with activating parental controls across all home devices and ensuring that your children only access age-appropriate platforms, strictly avoiding the ""under-13"" social media trap. Make it a habit to perform a weekly digital check-in to monitor for signs of cyberbullying or contact from strangers, and always utilize the Safe Use filters provided by your UAE internet service provider.Most importantly, foster an environment of open communication where your children feel safe reporting suspicious activity, ensuring that your home remains a sanctuary of ""Mindful Digital Citizenship"" rather than a source of legal liability.","The United Arab Emirates has issued a new Federal Decree-Law on Child Digital Safety aimed at protecting children from online risks and harmful digital experiences.

Reality behind the snow





Imagine waking up, looking out your window in Dubai, and seeing the Burj Khalifa draped in a blanket of fresh, powdery snow. That was the dream His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence (lovingly known as Fazza), shared with his millions of followers this Thursday.His Highness, who is basically Dubai’s unofficial ""Chief Storyteller,"" posted a viral image that looked like a scene straight out of a Disney movie, except the ""Castle"" was a world-famous skyscraper.While the photo was a creative ""what if,"" it perfectly captured the mood of a city currently obsessed with the cold. The caption by His Highness, “how the weather will feel tomorrow,” was a cheeky nod to the freezing winds currently whistling through the city's glass towers.While we aren't exactly skiing down Sheikh Zayed Road just yet, the ""Real Feel"" temperature in the UAE is getting pretty close to the vision shared by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan. This week, the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) reported that the mercury hit a bone-chilling 0.2°C on Jebel Jais.For a city built for 45°C summers, this cold snap has changed the way we live:The viral image itself is a masterclass in digital art, likely utilizing AI or high-level editing to show the world what Dubai would look like as a Nordic capital.It’s part of a larger trend where His Highness Sheikh Hamdan uses his platform to highlight the beauty and seasonal shifts of the city in a fun, relatable way.However, the weather scientists at the NCM remind us that while the photo is a fantasy, the Siberian High Pressure system is very real. These winds are pushing clouds across the country and keeping the sun from heating up the desert floor, making this one of the most sustained cold periods the UAE has seen in years. The NCM has even issued warnings about fierce winds, reminding everyone that this winter ""nip"" has some real power behind it.There is something about a cold morning that brings a community together. Whether it’s sharing a viral post from His Highness Sheikh Hamdan or huddling together at a weekend desert camp, the ""Fazza Snow"" photo has become a cultural moment.

How the Darb toll system really works in the UAE



You must register your vehicle with the Darb toll management system to receive legitimate alerts about unpaid tolls or fines.

Registered vehicles are monitored automatically; toll charges are debited from your account or wallet within the official app or platform.

Official Darb alerts always appear via the app or authorised government SMS services, not from foreign or unrecognised numbers.

Tips to protect yourself from toll scams



Ignore Unknown Toll Alerts - If the toll message comes from an unfamiliar number or contains an unusual link, do not click it, even if the amount looks small. Check Your Payments Directly - Open the Darb app or visit the official website to see if there are legitimate pending charges or fines. Don’t Reply to Suspicious Messages - Responding to scam texts, even with “Y” as instructed, can trigger further scam activity or lead to phishing. Report Scam Messages - Forward the suspicious message to your carrier or mark it as spam; consider notifying local authorities or Q Mobility support. Learn Scam Signs - Scammers often use international numbers, grammar errors, URLs that resemble official domains but differ slightly, and urgent language warning of fines.

Fake Messages Sent by Darb Toll Scammers





Motorists across the UAE, especially in Abu Dhabi, have been warned about fraudulent messages lurking in text inboxes that claim to be official Darb toll alerts. These scam notifications say that drivers have pending Darb toll fees and urge them to click on a link or reply “Y” to settle fines quickly. However, authorities say that these are fake messages designed to trick people into clicking malicious links and potentially giving up personal or payment information.Prompted by a spike in user reports and online complaints, transport officials and cybersecurity experts are now sounding the alarm for drivers to remain vigilant and only use authorised government channels to check toll violations or make payments.In recent days, several UAE residents reported receiving SMS messages titled “DARB-Alert” claiming there are pending toll fees, often just a few dirhams and warning that a fine (typically Dh100) and points could be imposed if the fee isn’t paid “today.”The messages often include:However, when investigators looked at these messages, they found red flags:Similar patterns are being discussed across social media threads, with users warning each other not to click the links.One Dubai Reddit user noted the suspicious URL included spelling errors and a non-government “.com” address, something official toll notifications would never use.Q Mobility, the operator of Abu Dhabi’s Darb toll system and part of the Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company (ADQ) has repeatedly warned users to verify any message claiming to be from them. According to a recent social media post from the company, the only trusted channels for toll alerts and payments are:Q Mobility stressed that official notifications clearly identify themselves and never request responses like “Reply Y.” They also do not include unofficial URLs.Cyber scams of this kind are part of a broader trend of phishing and fake alert campaigns targeting UAE residents in recent years. Authorities including Abu Dhabi Police have actively run awareness campaigns like the “Be Cautious” initiative to educate the public about online fraud tactics, from deceptive links to phishing phone calls.These scam messages exploit urgency and fear, suggesting fines or legal penalties, to trick people into acting impulsively. That’s a common tactic in digital fraud, and law enforcement agencies caution against clicking unfamiliar links or providing sensitive personal or financial data.Similar warnings have been issued about traffic fine phishing emails in the UAE, where fraudsters use fake police logos and official-looking layouts to dupe people into clicking links to bogus payment pages.Understanding how the toll system functions sheds light on why you should not trust random messages:If you suspect you genuinely owe a toll payment, you should open the Darb app or log in to darb.qmobility.ae directly, not via a link in a text message.Here’s how residents are being advised to stay safe:With digital payments and e-services becoming the norm for tolls, parking and traffic fines, scams that mimic these systems can cause real harm, from financial loss to identity theft. Authorities across the UAE have consistently advised residents to verify all digital communications before acting.Abu Dhabi’s integrated transport technology continues to evolve, including paid parking integration through the Darb app and new traffic regulations to improve road flow and compliance. But the convenience of these services also attracts fraudsters looking to exploit public trust.Staying informed and cautious is essential to avoiding scams and ensuring that digital traffic services work as intended.",UAE drivers warned about fraudulent messages claiming to be official Darb toll alerts.

Weather patterns drive prolonged winter conditions

Satellite imagery reveals the scale of accumulation

Kamchatka’s geography amplifies winter extremes





Following weeks of severe winter weather, snow has covered a sizable portion of the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia. In December and January, there were frequent storms and extended periods of cold that gradually spread throughout towns, roads, and open spaces. According to local sources, snowfall has reached levels not seen in decades, piling several meters in a little amount of time. This winter, high-altitude wind shifts have caused instability in the broader atmosphere, affecting weather well beyond the Arctic. Although Kamchatka is accustomed to harsh seasons, this one has persisted. The peninsula's volcanic environment is now mostly covered by snow, according to satellite pictures, leaving populations to adapt while conditions continue to shift slowly.In Petropavlovsk Kamchatsky, daily movement became difficult as snow continued to fall and settle. Roads narrowed. Cars disappeared beneath drifts. Entrances to buildings were blocked, sometimes more than once. Public transport stopped and restarted in fits. Residents spoke of short walks becoming longer tasks. Emergency crews focused on keeping key routes open, though progress was uneven. In some areas, snow rose to the height of lower windows.The weight of it was gradual rather than sudden, with each storm adding to what was already there, leaving little chance for clearing to catch up.NASA points to changes greater in the atmosphere earlier in the season. A sudden warming event near the Arctic weakened the polar vortex, allowing cold air to move more freely. The jet stream became less stable, bending and shifting in ways that favoured repeated storms. Kamchatka sits where cold northern air can meet moisture from the Pacific. When that balance holds, snowfall can persist. This winter, the pattern did not break quickly. Instead, it returned again and again, keeping temperatures low and snow falling longer than expected.Mid January images from NASA ’s Aqua satellite show fresh snow across Kamchatka’s mountains and valleys. Volcanic peaks appear as pale circles against darker terrain, a familiar shape but more widely covered than usual.

The pictures do not explain everything. They simply show how much has settled, and how little has shifted.The peninsula’s steep mountains rise quickly from the coast, shaping how storms behave. Moist air lifts, cools, and releases snow as it moves inland. Storms often intensify as they cross the terrain, dropping heavier snow before reaching towns. Residents are familiar with this rhythm. Still, records suggest the recent totals compare with winters from the 1970s. Such seasons place quiet pressure on housing, transport, and power systems. For now, the snow remains, and daily life continues to work around it rather than through it.","7 feet of snow brings Kamchatka to a standstill after weeks of relentless storms.

Life survives where fog reaches land

A desert shaped by human use and neglect





The Atacama Desert lies along the northern edge of Chile, a long strip pressed between the Pacific Ocean and the Andes. It is often described as the driest place on Earth, though that description feels almost too neat. According to Discovery , in some parts, rainfall averages around 0.03 inches a year. In others, rain has not been recorded within living memory. The ground shows it. Stone replaces soil. Salt lakes dry into hard white plates. Nothing seems recent. Yet the desert is not remote in the usual sense. It sits beside the largest ocean on the planet, close to ports, roads and cities. That contrast shapes how the region feels. Water is near, but it does not arrive. The desert remains exposed, quiet, and largely unchanged by weather.The Andes climb abruptly to the east, providing a wall that prevents wet air from leaving the continent. To the west, the Pacific sends clouds inland, which rarely turn into rain. The chilly Humboldt current cools the air near the surface, while warmer air sits above it. Storms give way to fog. Low clouds move across hills and then disappear.This pattern does not shift often. High-pressure systems linger.Seasons pass without interruption. The result is not a dramatic drought but a steady absence. The landscape adjusts slowly. Nothing grows quickly. Nothing disappears quickly, either.Most of the interior remains almost empty of vegetation. In some areas, even dead plant matter does not decompose. Researchers have found organic remains that may be thousands of years old. This stillness is part of what draws scientists. Space agencies test Mars equipment here because the ground behaves in unfamiliar ways.Closer to the coast and along isolated hills, the picture changes slightly. Fog collects on slopes, feeding small plant communities. Bromeliads draw moisture directly from the air. Short-lived plants appear briefly, then vanish. Around 550 plant species exist in these pockets, many found nowhere else. Animals remain few. Insects, scorpions, lizards and small birds form fragile chains that break easily.The Atacama also holds vast deposits of sodium nitrate. Mining reshaped parts of the desert in the early twentieth century. Towns appeared, then emptied. Buildings still stand, preserved by the dry air. Tools rust slowly. Roads lead nowhere.Today, the desert continues to attract attention, though for different reasons. NASA scientists, astronomers and engineers arrive, then leave. The land absorbs little of their presence. The Atacama does not respond quickly. It does not offer clear signals. It remains dry, cool, and unresolved, holding its distance even as people study it closely.","The Atacama Desert lies along the northern edge of Chile, a long strip pressed between the Pacific Ocean and the Andes.

How China created artificial islands by dumping sand into the sea in just one decade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/how-china-created-artificial-islands-by-dumping-sand-into-the-sea-in-just-one-decade/articleshow/127130796.cms,"How China created artificial islands by dumping sand into the sea in just one decade (AI-generated)

China’s island-building over the past decade has reshaped the seabed

Xi 'SCOLDS' Trump For Using China To Stoke Greenland Fear | US' Arctic Power Play Backfires?

What happens to coral reefs underneath

These waters matter for marine life

Artificial islands change water movement

Can the environmental impact be undone

What remains beneath the surface





The idea of constructing an island in the middle of the ocean is not new. Decades ago, cities like Miami and San Francisco reshaped their shallow waters to extend their beaches. However, large-scale island building has been occurring farther away from any shore in recent years. Submerged reefs in the South China Sea have become permanent artificial islands due to widespread land reclamation. Although shipping routes and infrastructure are frequently mentioned in relation to these projects, their environmental impact is not as well-known. The Spratly Islands are located in one of the world's most biologically diverse oceanic environments. Here, seafloor landscapes that took thousands of years to build have been changed by construction activities. Marine biologists caution that more significant ecological harm below the surface may be indicated by the physical alterations that are now apparent from satellites.Creating land in the middle of the sea requires enormous quantities of material. Dredging ships scrape sand, coral and sediment from the seabed, often from nearby reefs and lagoons. This material is then pumped onto shallow features until they rise above the waterlineThe process stirs up fine sediment, which can drift for kilometres.Suspended particles reduce sunlight penetration, making it harder for corals and seagrasses to survive. Once settled, the sediment can smother living reefs, blocking the flow of water and oxygen.Coral reefs are not just rocks. They are living structures built slowly by coral animals over centuries. When reefs are buried under sand and concrete, the organisms that form them die. In the Spratly Islands, reefs support a wide range of species, from small reef fish to larger predators. They also serve as nursery grounds for larvae that replenish fisheries across the South China Sea. Damage to these reefs affects ecosystems far beyond the immediate construction sites. Marine biologists say that once a reef is destroyed at this scale, recovery is unlikely within any human timeframe.The South China Sea contains some of the highest marine biodiversity in the world. Its reefs, seagrass beds and open waters support endangered species including sea turtles, sharks and giant clams. Many coastal communities around the region depend on these ecosystems for food. Fish stocks that spawn or feed around the Spratly reefs supply fisheries hundreds of kilometres away. Disrupting these habitats can weaken already stressed fish populations. Scientists note that environmental damage in shared waters rarely stays local.Natural reefs shape currents and waves in subtle ways. When they are replaced with solid land and concrete walls, water flow changes. Altered currents can increase erosion in some areas while causing sediment build up in others. This can affect nearby reefs that were not directly dredged. Changes in wave patterns may also influence how nutrients and larvae move through the region. These secondary effects are difficult to predict and even harder to reverse.Experts largely agree that the damage caused by large-scale reef burial is permanent. Unlike oil spills or surface pollution, the physical removal of reef structures leaves little to recover. Some artificial islands include measures such as limited green spaces or energy installations. These do not replace lost ecosystems. Coral restoration projects exist, but they operate on a small scale and require stable, undisturbed conditions. In heavily altered areas, marine life often shifts rather than returns.From above, reclaimed islands appear solid and orderly. Below the waterline, the picture is less clear. Broken reef fragments, altered seabeds and disrupted habitats tell a quieter story. Marine scientists continue to study the long-term effects, though access to some sites is limited. What is already evident is that island building in sensitive waters carries costs that extend well beyond the visible shoreline.Information is based on a publication of Earth Island Institute",China’s island-building over the past decade has reshaped the seabed.

Special medical considerations for Ramadan 2026



Bottom line: Opt for a balanced, informed approach this Ramadan 2026







As Ramadan 2026 nears, millions around the world are preparing not only spiritually but physically for a month of dawn-to-sunset fasting. While fasting is a beloved religious observance, health experts emphasise that preparation and smart nutrition are crucial to maintaining wellbeing throughout the month. Combining insights from local doctors and reputable global health organisations, here is a trusted guide to help you fast safely and comfortably.Adequate hydration is one of the most important components of a successful fast. The World Health Organization (WHO) Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office specifically recommends drinking plenty of water (at least around 10 glasses) and eating hydrating foods such as soups and fresh fruits like watermelon and salads during non-fasting hours to compensate for fluids lost during the day. They also advise avoiding caffeinated drinks such as coffee, tea and cola because caffeine increases urination and can lead to dehydration.Cornell Health, the health and wellbeing service of Cornell University, echoes this and adds that one should drink fluids at regular intervals through the night and avoid consuming too much at once, as over-hydration in one go can dilute electrolytes.Skipping the pre-dawn meal (suhoor) can make fasting significantly harder.Nutrition experts from Cornell Health advise that suhoor should include a mix of whole grains, protein, healthy fats and fruits or vegetables to help sustain energy and keep blood sugar stable throughout the long fast. Examples include whole-grain cereals or toast with eggs, yogurt with fruit and nuts, or brown rice with vegetables.The WHO also recommends that suhoor be light but nutritious, particularly for groups who may be more vulnerable during fasting such as elderly adults, adolescents, pregnant or nursing women.Both WHO and international dietary guides emphasise the benefits of starting iftar (the evening meal that breaks the fast) with water and dates, a longstanding tradition rooted in health as well as faith. Dates provide natural sugars and a small energy boost while water immediately begins rehydrating the body after prolonged abstinence.This approach is supported by general Ramadan nutrition advice from organisations such as Fraser Health in Canada, which notes that dates and low-fat milk are a healthy way to break the fast and can help prevent abrupt blood sugar fluctuations that contribute to fatigue.Healthline, a respected medical and nutrition information site, recommends leaning into whole foods rich in fiber, lean proteins and healthy carbohydrates during iftar to replenish nutrients lost during the day and provide lasting energy through the night and into the next fast. Examples include vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, eggs, legumes and dairy.Their registered dietitians also emphasise moderation, eating mindfully at iftar and avoiding heavy, sugary, or high-fat foods that can cause indigestion and fatigue. Starting with water and a small date or fruit before main dishes helps control appetite and prevent overeating.Several health authorities recommend reducing caffeine intake in the week leading up to Ramadan. Research and expert advice from wellness organisations suggest that sudden withdrawal from habitual caffeine can lead to headaches and fatigue, symptoms many people misattribute to fasting itself. Gradually tapering coffee and tea before Ramadan can help your body avoid these issues once fasting begins.Moreover, WHO guidance clearly states avoiding caffeine during suhoor and non-fasting periods because it increases urine output and can exacerbate dehydration, something you want to minimise before long fasting hours.WHO and other health organisations encourage a balanced diet throughout Ramadan, composed of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and sufficient fluids, while limiting deep-fried, processed or high-sugar foods that contribute little nutrition and can lead to discomfort or weight gain.This aligns with Cornell Health’s advice on maintaining good nutrition: including vegetables, whole grains and healthy proteins at both suhoor and iftar to help manage hunger, energy levels, and overall health during the fast.While Ramadan is not usually a time for intense workouts during fasting hours, light movement and gentle exercise in the evening, such as walking or stretching, can support digestion and circulation, according to health advisors. Framing this within a balanced lifestyle helps preserve energy without risking dehydration or exhaustion.Sleep hygiene is also important because altered timetables can disrupt normal sleep cycles during Ramadan. Experts advise aiming for adequate rest (7–8 hours if possible) by incorporating naps and consistent sleeping schedules into your routine, which supports physical recovery throughout the fasting month.International health bodies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and dietetics professionals often emphasise that people with chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease or those on specific medications should consult a healthcare provider before fasting. Adjustments to meal timing, medication schedules and monitoring plans ensure safety and prevent complications.This is particularly relevant for individuals whose medical treatments require food or water intake at specific times and cannot be adjusted without professional supervision.Preparing your body for Ramadan fasting is not just about abstaining from food and drink during daylight hours. It is about planning smartly, hydrating fully, eating nutrient-dense meals and respecting your body’s needs. Strategies backed by the World Health Organization, Cornell Health and other recognised health authorities affirm that with proper preparation, most people can experience a safe, comfortable and fulfilling Ramadan.By following these evidence-based tips, from hydration and meal composition to rest and medical consultation, you can approach the holy month with both spiritual intention and physical wellbeing.",Ramadan 2026: Are You Ready to Fast Safely?

— Dubai Media Office (@DXBMediaOffice) January 18, 2026

In January 2026, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) unveiled a milestone in sustainable transport: the arrival and imminent deployment of Zhongtong electric buses capable of operating up to 280 kilometres on a single charge on urban routes. This development, part of a 735-bus procurement plan that includes 40 electric units, marks one of the largest and most advanced electric public-bus deployments in the UAE to date. It reflects Dubai’s accelerating commitment to zero-emission mobility and its broader climate strategy for 2050.At the heart of this initiative is the Zhongtong electric bus, a 12-metre, custom-designed vehicle tailored to Dubai’s climate and operational conditions. Powered by a 434 kWh battery and supported by 360 kW ABB fast chargers, the buses can cover daily routes without having to return to depots for recharging. That 280 km range on a single charge is a major leap for electric public buses in the region, where high temperatures and intensive daily service patterns have previously limited operational efficiency.This deployment makes Dubai one of the first Gulf cities to run electric buses at this scale, with enhanced range and performance that can sustain an entire day’s worth of urban service before needing replenishment.The Zhongtong buses are not a standalone effort. They form a part of the RTA’s Zero-Emission Public Transport Strategy 2050, which aims to transform Dubai’s transit network into a fully zero-emission system by mid-century. Under this strategy, the goal is for all public buses, taxis and limousine services to run on electric or hydrogen power by 2050, supporting wider national climate objectives, including climate neutrality and carbon-footprint reduction.","The Zhongtong electric bus is the first of its type to be operated on Dubai’s urban routes.

Dubai’s Lost & Found: A model for smart cities







Dubai’s famous taxis are not just fast and reliable, they are also a magnet for forgotten belongings. According to the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), passengers left behind a staggering 104,162 items in taxis across the Emirate during 2025, prompting one of the city’s busiest Lost & Found seasons on record as drivers and the RTA worked to reunite commuters with their lost property.From wallets stuffed with cash to passports and gadgets, the range of forgotten items reflects the hustle of everyday life in Dubai and the efficiency of a system designed to ensure that lost does not have to mean gone forever. Here’s a closer look at what riders forgot most and how Dubai’s smart mobility network brought them back.The lost and found numbers from RTA reveal that Dubai riders were not just leaving behind the occasional umbrella or pair of sunglasses, they were dropping valuable and essential items after rides. Over AED 2 million in cash was handed into the Lost & Found team in 2025, alongside a flood of high-tech devices and personal documents.Here’s a snapshot of what riders left behind:These figures highlight just how often commuters hustle out of taxis without double-checking pockets, bags or seat areas, perhaps rushed by work, social plans or caregiving duties. The sheer volume also underscores the importance of Dubai’s lost-item recovery infrastructure.The Dubai RTA did not just log these reports; it made getting items back surprisingly smooth for riders. RTA’s system is built around swift communication, detailed tracking and cooperation between call center teams, drivers and taxi companies, often resulting in a recovery within two hours of the initial report.Meera Al Shaikh, Director of Customer Happiness at the RTA, explained that the lost property framework strengthens trust in Dubai’s mobility ecosystem, raising satisfaction not just for journeys but for what passengers take with them afterward.The reporting process itself is multilingual and highly accessible. Passengers can report lost items through:Services are offered in Arabic, English, Hindi, Filipino, French, Chinese, Russian and more, reflecting Dubai’s highly diverse population and making it easy for tourists, residents and workers alike to submit a lost item claim with minimal friction.Being distracted, juggling bags or stepping out in a hurry are everyday occurrences but in a city like Dubai, where taxi trips can be short and frequent, these moments add up to a significant number of forgotten belongings. Unlike many other global cities where lost items may never be reunited with their owners, Dubai’s approach has become a benchmark for urban mobility services.However, it is not just about numbers. The system empowers riders to reclaim valuables quickly and securely. Identity verification protects passengers’ privacy and integrated tracking technologies ensure swift communication with drivers once an item is reported.The RTA’s Lost & Found team reported over 30 messages of gratitude from riders in 2025 alone, a small but telling indicator of how these efforts improve everyday life for commuters across the city.Even with an efficient recovery system in place, prevention is always better than reclamation. Common taxi riders in Dubai and beyond often leave behind items like smartphones, wallets and keys simply because they’re thinking about their next stop. Research from ride-hailing lost property indexes elsewhere suggests items like glasses, bags and even wedding rings sometimes get left behind when commuters rush between meetings or errands.Here are practical tips to reduce that “oops” moment:What if something does get left behind? Filing a report via the RTA call centre or app quickly is the best way to get that item back while the taxi is still nearby.Dubai’s experience with lost items in taxis is not just about forgetfulness, it is a testament to how smart city infrastructure, responsive government services and community cooperation can turn everyday problems into positive outcomes. Where some cities struggle to reunite lost property with owners, Dubai’s integrated approach, supported by multicultural service channels and tech-enabled systems, sets a high bar.Indeed, the success of the lost property framework complements other facets of Dubai’s transportation vision, which includes expanding digital taxi fleets and enhancing connectivity for residents and visitors alike. Whether it is reconnecting a commuter with their passport or returning a laptop they thought was long gone, Dubai’s taxi Lost & Found system is proving that a seamless urban experience includes confidence that what you leave behind can often be found again, fast, safe and with a smile.","Dubai riders left behind 104,162 items in taxis during 2025, prompting one of the city’s busiest Lost & Found seasons on record.

Dubai issues warning over illegal parking deals in Discovery Gardens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-issues-warning-over-illegal-parking-deals-in-discovery-gardens/articleshow/126706296.cms,"Discovery Gardens introduces paid parking in Dubai, warns residents against unofficial rentals / Image: file

Official warning

Permit rules and fees

Delays and app challenges





Dubai’s Discovery Gardens community has introduced a regulated paid parking system aimed at managing the growing number of vehicles and reducing congestion. This change, effective from January 15, 2026, makes on-street parking a paid service, with licence zone signs now in place across the neighbourhood. Residents must apply for parking permits through the official Parkonic system rather than relying on informal arrangements.Each residential unit in buildings without dedicated parking receives one free permit for a vehicle. Additional cars require a paid subscription, typically Dh945 per month or Dh2,625 quarterly, as part of the effort to ensure fair usage and open up street spaces for legitimate residents.In response to posts on community social media pages offering private parking spaces for rent, Parkonic has cautioned residents against unofficial deals. These offers, circulating on platforms like Facebook, involve tenants advertising outdoor parking spaces in exchange for monthly fees.Parkonic emphasised that all valid parking permits can only be obtained through its official app or authorised channels.Payments and registrations made outside the recognised platforms are not supported, and vehicles using such informal arrangements may face regular visitor parking charges or be considered unauthorised, potentially leading to fines or penalties.This advisory aims to protect residents from possible scams and confusion, and to ensure all parking entitlements remain traceable and enforceable under Dubai community rules.The new parking rules have sparked mixed reactions among tenants across the community. Some argue that the fees for second vehicles are too high, especially for families with more than one car, calling for reductions to Dh500-Dh600 or other concessions to ease the burden.There have also been specific concerns from residents of the Zen Cluster (Pink Buildings), a part of Discovery Gardens where only certain apartments have basement parking. A recent circular clarified that on-street parking is excluded from complimentary permit eligibility if a residential unit already has basement parking access, meaning many studio tenants now face visitor tariffs instead of free permits.Residents in this cluster say the lack of free street permits unfairly penalises them and are pushing for equal treatment with tenants in other parts of the community.The transition hasn’t been without hiccups. Parkonic extended the registration deadline to January 19 after numerous residents reported difficulties using the Parkonic app, such as system errors and inability to activate permits even after receiving PINs.To address these issues, Parkonic pledged that residents will not face fines while technical problems persist and that support teams are working to resolve account and activation challenges. This temporary extension has helped more tenants complete the permit process without penalty.Overall, the introduction of paid and regulated parking in Discovery Gardens represents a broader trend in Dubai to standardise parking across communities and reduce misuse by non-residents or long-term street storage. The system aims to free up spaces, reduce traffic problems and prioritise residents, but it also highlights the need for clear communication and flexibility as lived realities catch up with policy.As implementation continues, resident feedback will likely shape future adjustments, especially around fee levels, eligibility criteria, and enforcement practices.",Dubai’s Discovery Gardens community has introduced a regulated paid parking system aimed at managing the growing number of vehicles.

Abu Dhabi rolls out blood test capable of detecting 50+ cancer types,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/abu-dhabi-rolls-out-blood-test-capable-of-detecting-50-cancer-types/articleshow/126670898.cms,"Abu Dhabi’s new blood test makes cancer screening as simple as a lab draw / AI Illustration

How do blood tests detect cancer?

The rollout

Age and Risk: The test is primarily aimed at residents aged 40 and above. It is particularly recommended for those with a family history of cancer or those who have missed traditional screenings.



Location: You can access the test at major healthcare hubs, including facilities operated by Ambulatory Healthcare Services (AHS) and the M42 healthcare network. This covers clinics across Abu Dhabi city, Al Ain, and the Al Dhafra region.



Complimentary Use: It is important to note that this test is meant to complement traditional screenings (like papsmears or mammograms), providing an extra layer of security for cancers that don't have standard screening methods.

Cost

Why does this matter?





Abu Dhabi is once again setting a global benchmark in healthcare. The Department of Health (DoH) and the Abu Dhabi Public Health Centre (ADPHC) have officially introduced a revolutionary Multi-Cancer Early Detection (MCED) blood test.This isn't just another medical check-up; it is a sophisticated ""liquid biopsy"" that can spot the early biological fingerprints of over 50 different types of cancer from a single tube of blood.For years, the medical world has struggled to screen for ""silent killers"", cancers like those in the pancreas, liver, and brain, which often show no symptoms until it is too late.By identifying fragments of cancer DNA circulating in the bloodstream, this test provides a window into the body's health that traditional scans might miss, catching tumors when they are most treatable.The newly introduced test works by identifying cancer-related biological markers circulating in the blood. Unlike traditional screenings, which usually target one cancer at a time, this test can detect dozens of cancers in a single sample, including types that currently have no standard screening methods, such as pancreatic, gastric and certain brain cancers.From a healthcare-system perspective, this is a major accomplishment.It reduces the need for multiple invasive procedures, lowers patient hesitation around screening, and makes early detection far more accessible. The test requires no fasting, no preparation and no hospital admission, making it suitable for integration into routine health check-ups.Doctors involved in the programme have emphasised that this approach removes many of the psychological and practical barriers that prevent people from getting screened in the first place, a key reason cancers are often detected too late.The Department of Health is rolling out this technology with a specific focus on those who need it most. The service is being integrated into the existing IFHAS program, which is Abu Dhabi's comprehensive health screening initiative for residents.The test is currently priced between AED 7,000 and AED 8,000, reflecting the advanced technology behind it. While not positioned as a mass free screening yet, health experts note that detecting multiple cancers through a single test can be more cost-effective over time than multiple separate investigations and late-stage treatments.More importantly, the rollout sends a strong signal about the future direction of healthcare in the UAE, one that prioritises early intervention, data-driven diagnostics and patient-friendly solutions. As similar technologies continue to evolve globally, Abu Dhabi’s early adoption places it among regions leading the transition toward next-generation preventive medicine.This initiative is not just about a new test, it represents an institutional achievement. Abu Dhabi has demonstrated how advanced science, policy support and healthcare infrastructure can come together to address one of the world’s deadliest diseases more effectively.By making early cancer detection simpler and more accessible, the emirate has taken a decisive step toward saving lives before they reach hospital wards, a true measure of progress in modern healthcare.","Abu Dhabi has introduced a revolutionary blood test for cancer screening.

How does it work?

Shared Rides with Tech-Enabled SUVs: Instead of every family driving separately, students are grouped by neighbourhood and ride in shared, tech-equipped SUVs or buses to and from school.



Smart Routes, Same Targets: Routes are planned using demand data, grouping students headed in similar directions and aligned with school start and finish times.



Optimised Timing: RTA aims to keep ride times under 60 minutes for most trips, which is more predictable than traditional buses or variable car drop-offs.



Managed by Partners: The pilot is being run with Yango Group providing tech and booking systems, and Urban Express Transport operating the vehicles.

The traditional big yellow bus is getting a high-tech makeover. Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has officially rolled out a pilot program that lets students trade the standard bus seat for a luxury SUV. Launched in mid-January 2026, this ""pooled transport"" initiative is designed for students aged 14 and above who attend schools in high-traffic clusters.Instead of a fixed, long-winded bus route that stops at every corner, these high-end vehicles use smart data from Yango Group and Urban Express to pick up students living in the same neighborhood. By grouping children heading to nearby schools into one premium vehicle, the RTA hopes to slash the number of private cars clogging up school gates every morning.Dubai’s pooled system is a shared ride model designed to be efficient, safe and modern:Unlike traditional dedicated school buses that serve only one school, this model is zoned and demand-responsive, similar to ride-hailing, but tailored for students and safety.The initial phase of this ""neighborhood pooling"" is focused on the Al Barsha area, one of Dubai's busiest education hubs. If your child attends one of the following six schools, you are eligible to register for the service:The service isn't just about the ride; it's about the timing.The RTA guarantees that no student will spend more than 60 minutes in the vehicle, and routes are optimized daily to ensure the fastest possible trip from doorstep to classroom. Price of premiumWhile ""luxury SUV"" sounds expensive, the pooling model actually makes it surprisingly affordable. The pilot has launched with a special introductory rate of AED 1,000 per month.Compared to the cost of fuel, the time spent by a parent or driver in traffic, and traditional bus fees, the RTA estimates this model can save families about 15% in costs. Parents get the peace of mind of live vehicle tracking through a dedicated app, and the vehicles are held to the same strict safety standards as regular school buses, including smart monitoring and RTA-certified drivers.The ""SUV for students"" move is part of a larger strategy to get 60% of students into shared transport within the next three years. For the average resident, even those without school-age kids, this is a win. Fewer private cars performing U-turns and double-parking at school gates means a smoother flow for everyone during the 7:30 AM rush.Ahmed Hashem Bahrozyan, CEO of the Public Transport Agency, emphasized that the pilot is a ""step-change"" in how Dubai handles daily mobility. If the Al Barsha trial shows a significant drop in congestion, the RTA plans to expand the SUV and pooled bus service to other major school districts across Dubai by the start of the next school year in September 2026.","Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has officially rolled out a pilot program that lets students trade the standard bus seat for a luxury SUV.

Coup In Britain? Starmer’s ‘Own Cabinet Plots’ His Downfall | ‘Full Bunker Mode’ In No. 10





The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true. ""The UK is set to introduce a nationwide curfew, beginning at 11pm each night,"" he appears to say on one of thousands of TikTok videos of him posted in last six months. ""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok. By Dec 19, most appeared to have been removed from the platform. Howard said the use of AI in politics is increasing rapidly. ""We know it's internationally pervasive now,"" he said.

NEW DELHI: The first list of selected candidates for nursery admissions will be released today, marking the beginning of a closely watched admission process for thousands of parents across the city. Schools follow a points-based system to draw up their lists, and authorities have laid out a clear timeline for queries, revisions and subsequent lists.Parents will be able to raise objections or seek clarifications from January 24 to February 3 if they find discrepancies in the points awarded to their child. The second list of selected candidates will be released on February 9, followed by a query resolution window from February 10 to 16. If seats remain vacant, a subsequent list will be issued on March 5. The admission process will formally close on March 19.Schools typically assess applications using a points-based criterion that includes factors such as neighbourhood or distance from the school, whether a sibling is already studying there, alumni status of parents, and in some cases, whether the applicant is a girl child. Additional points may also be awarded to single-parent families or only children, depending on individual school policies.Higher points translate into a better rank on the selection list.Officials and education experts have advised parents not to panic if their child’s name does not appear in the first list, noting that multiple lists are released as some families decline seats, leading to vacancies.Parents are also urged to keep all required documents ready to avoid last-minute delays. These include the child’s birth certificate, proof of residence such as Aadhaar card, voter ID or a utility bill, parents’ identity proof, passport-size photographs, and any school-specific documents such as sibling proof, alumni certificates or transfer certificates, where applicable.Schools have asked parents to regularly check their official websites for updates on criteria, points awarded and admission schedules, and to use the designated query windows to flag any concerns.","The first list of selected candidates for nursery admissions will be released today.

Aadhaar enters US SSN debate: Far-right political writer Curtis Yarvin sparks backlash with anti-India slur,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/aadhaar-enters-us-ssn-debate-far-right-political-writer-curtis-yarvin-sparks-backlash-with-anti-india-slur/articleshow/127048426.cms,"What Yarvin posted and why it sparked outrage



Why Aadhaar lands in US identity debates

What’s wrong with SSNs and why it matters now





Far-right political writer Curtis Yarvin has triggered backlash online after pulling India’s Aadhaar biometric identity system into a debate about the weaknesses of the US Social Security Number (SSN). Yarvin quote-posted a thread praising Aadhaar’s fingerprint-and-iris-based verification model as a stronger way to link identity to a real person, but his comment drew condemnation for using an anti-India slur and mocking language. The exchange quickly became a flashpoint in a growing conversation about how outdated identity systems leave economies exposed to fraud, even as modern biometric tools become more widely discussed.Yarvin was responding to a post that argued the US should move beyond SSNs as the default identity backbone. The message he quote-posted read:“It’s strange that SSN is not linked to physical person with a biometric. It should be like your own physical key that works only for you and for no one else.India built iris+fingerprint system for national ID. Good foundational service for many things.”The point of the post was to praise Aadhaar as a scalable identity layer, and to suggest the US could modernise its own system by adopting a stronger “proof-of-person” model.Yarvin’s reply, however, became the headline for the wrong reason. Instead of sticking to a policy critique, he used racist meme-style wording aimed at Indians, which many saw as a cheap insult dressed up as commentary.Curtis Yarvin is a polarising American writer and software developer, best known for his earlier blogging under the pseudonym “Mencius Moldbug”. He is widely associated with neo-reactionary politics and has built a following by attacking democratic institutions, what he calls entrenched bureaucratic power, and the wider liberal political order in the US. He has also been repeatedly criticised for flirting with racist and extremist-adjacent ideas, and for promoting a worldview that rejects egalitarianism.Yarvin does not believe modern democracy is a legitimate or functional system. Instead, he argues in favour of a more centralised, authoritarian-style model of governance, where power is concentrated under a single executive who can “run the state” more like a company and override what he views as bureaucratic paralysis. His online style is deliberately provocative, mixing internet slang with arguments about state capacity and institutional collapse.Aadhaar is India’s biometric identity programme built around fingerprints and iris scans, designed to verify identity at a national scale. Supporters describe it as a foundational digital infrastructure system because it allows identity verification to work more reliably across services.In the context of the US debate, Aadhaar is often referenced as proof that a large country can implement a modern identity layer tied to a real person, rather than relying on a number that can be stolen or misused.SSNs were created as an administrative identifier, not as a secure authentication tool for the internet era. Over time, they evolved into a de facto identity key used across financial services, credit, and verification systems, despite not being designed for that role.That mismatch has long fuelled concerns about identity theft and fraud, particularly as personal data breaches and synthetic identity scams become more common. Critics argue the US needs a stronger identity framework that can prove a person is real and present, not just in possession of a leaked number.",Far-right political writer Curtis Yarvin has triggered backlash online after pulling India’s biometric identity system into a debate about the weaknesses of the US Social Security Number (SSN) Yarvin quote-posted a thread praising the fingerprint-and-iris-based verification model as a stronger way to link identity to a real person.

It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.
