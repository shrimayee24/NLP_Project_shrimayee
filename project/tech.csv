Changes to the design for better gameplay



Still has the same chip, display, and Windows

Asus has launched the ROG Ally X , a new variant of its handheld gaming PC, at Computex 2024. The handheld promises to offer significant improvements over the original ROG Ally released last year, addressing many of its shortcomings while maintaining the core features that made it popular among gaming enthusiasts.The most notable upgrade in the ROG Ally X is the battery capacity, which has been doubled from 40Wh to 80Wh, potentially offering twice the battery life of its predecessor. The storage has also been increased to 1TB of PCIe NVMe SSD, using the more common M.2 2280 size for easier and cheaper upgrades. The RAM has been boosted from 16GB to 24GB of faster 7500MHz LPDDR5 RAM, allowing users to allocate more memory to the GPU without compromising system performance.The exterior design has undergone subtle changes, featuring gentler curves, deeper handgrips, and optimised positions for the joysticks and controls. The joysticks have been improved for better feedback and longevity, while the D-pad has been redesigned to reduce stickiness during circular movements. The fingerprint sensor is now recessed for easier locating, and the back buttons have been made smaller to minimise accidental presses.Asus has made several changes to the internal cooling system, introducing slimmer fans with a 10% increase in airflow and a redesigned airflow path that helps keep the display cool during gaming sessions.The microSD card slot has been repositioned to prevent malfunctions caused by its proximity to the exhaust vent in the original model.In terms of connectivity, the ROG Ally X features dual USB-C ports, one being Thunderbolt 4 compatible and the other supporting USB 3.2 Gen 2, replacing the combination USB-C and ROG XG Mobile Interface connector found on the original model. The device weighs 678g, 68g more than its predecessor, due to the added features and improvements.The ROG Ally X retains the same Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip , 7-inch 1080p 120Hz IPS LCD with AMD FreeSync Premium, speakers, and wireless connectivity as the original model. It comes with an updated version of Asus Armoury Crate SE software and runs on Windows 11 Home .Priced at $799 (around Rs 66,000), the ROG Ally X is now available for pre-order in black, bundled with a 3-month Game Pass subscription.","The ROG Ally X doubles the battery, with increased storage and RAM.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Scenario 1 – Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction within the same billing cycle Purchase transaction date – October 15, 2023 As bill is yet to be generated in the given case, the refund amount received on October 19, 2023, shall be adjusted with other debits, prior to calculation of the Total Amount Due. Refund on October 19, 2023 - For cancellation of purchase dated October 15, 2023 Scenario 2 – Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction post generation of bill but before making payment of the dues Purchase transaction date - October 29, 2023 The bill is generated on October 30, 2023, however, the payment towards the dues has not been made till the date of refund. Therefore, the refund amount received on November 04, 2023, shall be adjusted towards the Total Amount Due (TAD) and accordingly the cardholder will be required to pay only the remaining outstanding (Remaining outstanding = TAD – Refund amount). Scenario 3 – Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction for which payment has already been made Purchase transaction date - October 30, 2023 As the cardholder has already cleared the dues, card-issuers shall seek explicit consent of the cardholder to adjust the refund amount in line with the provision stipulated at Para 10(h) of the MD. Payment towards dues – November 06, 2023 Case I - If the cardholder gives explicit consent, then refund amount shall be adjusted. Refund on November 07, 2023 - For cancellation of purchase dated October 30, 2023 Case II - If the cardholder does not provide the consent or no response is received for adjustment of the refund, then the refund amount will be credited to the bank account of the cardholder in line with para 10(h). Further, if the cardholder makes a request for crediting the refund (transaction for which payment has already been made), the same shall be credited back to the bank account of the cardholder irrespective of the cut off defined under Para10(h).

Scenario 2

Purchase transaction date: October 29, 2023

Refund or reversal occurs after the bill is generated but before the payment due date (November 19, 2023).

Credit cards offer a convenient means to manage finances and enhance financial well-being. By using credit cards responsibly, individuals can build a positive credit history and improve their financial habits. It's important to use credit cards for expenses while ensuring timely repayment of debts to boost credit scores.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently introduced amendments effective from March 7, 2024, alongside releasing updated FAQs regarding credit and debit card issuance.One important question addressed in the FAQs is whether a credit card can be used beyond its sanctioned limit, with over-limit charges imposed, states an ET report. According to RBI guidelines, using a credit card beyond the approved limit (overlimit) necessitates explicit consent from the cardholder. Furthermore, cardholders must have the option to enable or disable the overlimit feature through various platforms provided by the card issuer. Without explicit consent, neither overlimit facilities can be extended nor overlimit charges levied.Here are some key FAQs derived from the Master Direction (MD) - Credit Card and Debit Card – Issuance and Conduct Directions, 2022:Card issuers cannot send credit cards without the customer's permission. If a customer gets an unsolicited card, they should not activate it or agree to its activation. If they don't consent, the issuer must close the credit card account within seven working days at no cost to the customer. The issuer will inform the customer about the closure. After that, the customer should destroy the card. If needed, the customer can complain to the issuer and escalate the issue to the RBI Ombudsman.If a cardholder fails to pay the total amount due by the payment due date, they will lose the interest-free credit period. Interest may be charged from the transaction date on the outstanding amount (adjusted for payments, refunds, or reversed transactions) and not the total due amount. Late payment fees and other charges will only apply to the outstanding amount after the payment due date, not the total amount due.Paragraphs 7(b) and 7(c) of the MD allow the issuance of different types of credit cards that can tap into the limits of various loan accounts. These cards are tailored to match the terms and conditions of the specific loan account. For instance, if a customer has an overdraft facility, they can receive a credit card to access the funds from that facility. The terms of use for this credit card, including interest rates, repayment schedules, penalties, and cash withdrawal limits, will mirror those of the overdraft facility.Additionally, paragraph 7(c) gives card issuers the flexibility to design Business Credit Cards according to their credit card policies. However, it's important to note that banks are not allowed to issue debit cards for cash credit or loan accounts.Which transactions can be used to reduce the amount owed and credited to the cardholder's bank account?In a standard credit card cycle from October 1, 2023, to October 30, 2023, assuming the bill is issued on October 30, 2023, and payment is due by November 19, 2023, here are the possible scenarios for adjusting credit:Activation of a credit card is confirmed through customer-initiated actions such as PIN generation, adjusting transaction controls, Interactive Voice Response, contacting customer care through recorded calls, or SMS communication. If the card remains inactive for more than 30 days from the date of issue, the card issuer must request One Time Password (OTP) based consent, as outlined in paragraph 6(a)(vi) of the MD.For business credit cards applied for by a corporate or business entity, card issuers must obtain explicit consent from the principal account holder, as specified in paragraph 6(a)(vi). Similarly, they must send notifications as per paragraph 8(b). This consent should come from the principal cardholder, unless otherwise stated in the agreement. Likewise, for retail credit cards, consent must be obtained from the principal cardholder, not from any add-on cardholders.Card issuers are not permitted to apply interest or other charges to unpaid taxes, levies, or charges. This provision, outlined in paragraph 9(b)(ii) of the MD, took effect from October 1, 2022. Therefore, card issuers cannot apply such charges to any unpaid taxes, levies, or charges billed from that date onwards.Regarding transactions eligible for adjustment towards outstanding dues and credited to the cardholder's bank account, let's consider a typical credit card billing cycle from October 1, 2023, to October 30, 2023. Assume the bill is generated on October 30, 2023, with a payment due date of November 19, 2023. Here are the different scenarios:- Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction within the same billing cycle:- Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction post-generation of bill but before making payment of the dues:","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently introduced amendments effective from March 7, 2024, alongside releasing updated FAQs regarding credit and debit card issuance.

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy . Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

Perplexity Pages vs Google AI Overviews

Perplexity, an AI search platform, has introduced Pages – a feature that creates customised reports based on text prompts. The feature uses an AI model to search, research and then create a report in accordance with the text input provided by the users.Perplexity AI Pages is a “tool for easily transforming research into visually stunning, comprehensive content. Whether you're crafting in-depth articles, detailed reports, or informative guides, Pages streamlines the process so you can focus on what matters most: sharing your knowledge with the world,” the company says.Pages allows users to create, organise and share information on any topic in a well-structured format. It says that the answers are customisable so that the results can be tailored according to the target audience.Users can also modify the structure of the article – add, rearrange, or remove sections to best suit the material and engage readers. The articles can also be embedded with visuals.Perplexity says that Pages is designed “to empower creators in any field to share knowledge.” The feature is aimed at educators, researchers and hobbyists.The company, which is touted to be one of the competitors of Google Search , offers an AI chatbot-powered research and conversational search engine that provides curated answers. The feature comes as Google recently rolled outAI Overviews that offer something similar.Google said that the AI Overviews feature “does the googling” for users and even returns answers to complex queries. The results offer additional links to access more information as well as photos and videos.However, AI Overviews received a backlash after it purportedly generated odd and erroneous overviews or results. Google has said that it is already working to improve the results and recently posted in a blog post that some of the answers circulated on the internet were fake.","Perplexity, an AI search platform, has introduced Pages feature.

Google Search is taking a step towards providing users with a more comprehensive weather experience. The familiar Weather card displayed on mobile search results now incorporates air quality information, allowing users to see both the temperature and how breathable the air is at a glance.Earlier, the Weather card focused on core weather data like temperature, precipitation chances, and wind. The inclusion of air quality adds another layer of vital information, especially for users living in areas prone to smog or pollution.The air quality information appears at the bottom of the Weather card. While it doesn't include the specific Air Quality Index ( AQI ) number, it uses a colour-coded system to indicate good, moderate, or unhealthy air quality. This quick visual cue allows users to make informed decisions about their outdoor activities.Tapping on the Weather card still directs users to a full weather page with a dedicated air quality section, displaying the AQI and other relevant metrics.Air quality data is already available in Google Maps , the At a Glance widget, and on Assistant-powered devices.The rollout of air quality information within the Weather card might not be immediate for all users. Google often implements updates in phases, so you might see it appear in your Search results soon, or it could take a little longer.","Air quality information appears at the bottom of the Weather card.

Verdict

Motorola has entered the Indian TWS market, characterised by cut-throat competition, with its mid-range earbuds. Alongside its latest Motorola Edge 50 series, the Lenovo-owned company introduced two earbuds -- Moto Buds and Moto Buds+ (Sound By Bose ) -- in India.Launched at Rs 9,999, the Moto Buds+ are Motorola's latest, most premium TWS offering in India. With this range, the company claims to improve the calling experience on TWS earbuds and make it stand out in the market. However, unlike the regular Moto Buds, which are available for Rs 4,999, the Moto Buds+ earphones boast advanced features and a collaboration with renowned audio company Bose for improved audio quality.With a premium design, long-lasting battery life and Active Noise Cancellation ( ANC ), the company claims that Moto Buds+ aims to make a significant impact in the competitive TWS market.We have been using the more expensive Moto Buds+ in Forest Grey colour for a few weeks and here we explore if this new pair of TWS earbuds live up to the company’s claims:The design of the Moto Buds+ bears a striking resemblance to other popular options like the OnePlus Buds 3 and Nothing Ear available in the market. The Moto Buds+ case easily fits into pockets without adding bulk and has a matte finish. The smooth build material doesn’t attract smudges or fingerprints. However, the build quality of the case felt somewhat flimsy.The case has a Motorola logo and ""Sound by Bose"" branding on top, an indicator light for pairing status and battery levels on the front as well as a USB-C charging port on the back.The case looks aesthetically pleasing and practical while the buds are sleek, modern, and have a functional design that stands out in the market.The buds feature short stems and silicone tips and offer a snug fit. The design of the earbuds ensures a secure and comfortable fit and comes with two additional sizes of ear tips. We spent hours wearing the earbuds and did not feel uncomfortable during the use.The earbuds are also equipped with an IP54 rating for water and dust resistance, making Moto Buds+ suitable for workouts and light rain.The “Sound by Bose” delivers high-quality audio on the Moto Buds+. The earbuds offer a rich, balanced sound profile with strong bass, clear mids and crisp highs (at default settings).The earbuds also support high-resolution audio codecs like LDAC and AAC, ensuring superior audio quality, and Dolby Atmos support adds an immersive dimension to the soundstage.The Moto Buds+ delivered a strong performance and the wearable also maintained clarity and sound quality at maximum volume levels.When we listened to the earphones at volumes hovering around 80%, the audio remained clear and well-balanced, with a slight emphasis on bass. The bass response at higher volumes was impressive and if you’re a fan of genres like hip-hop and R&B, the earphones are sure to provide a deep and enjoyable listening experience.If you don’t want the default bass-boosted audio, you can also change it from the companion app. The Moto Buds app has a simple user interface and offers an EQ tool with four presets—Flat (default), Bass Boost, Vocal Boost, and Brilliant Treble. The Manual option allowed us to customise the audio profile to our preference.While the Bass Boost can be overwhelming for some, we felt that the Vocal Boost and Brilliant Treble presets enhanced speech and vocal-heavy tracks effectively.Apart from excelling in music playback, the Moto Buds+ also performs well for videos and gaming. The earbuds can handle vocals quite well and ensure clear lyrics when we listen to the earphones at volumes above 50%. Movie dialogues and other speeches in videos also sounded good at higher volumes.The earbuds also have a dedicated Gaming mode which can be activated from the app. Enabling it decreases the response time but it disables Hi-Res audio. The earphones performed as expected. For example, we were able to better listen to the footsteps in games like BGMI.Motorola is also focussing on enhancing the call quality. The triple-mic array with CrystalTalk AI technology ensured clear voice pickup during calls in noisy environments. Calls on both ends sounded clear and stable.Talking about the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) on Moto Buds+, when turned on, the ANC mode (with up to 46dB) was able to effectively block noise to a large extent, though higher-pitched sounds seeped in occasionally.The earbuds offer a decent ANC performance and can reduce domestic noises from vacuum cleaners and mixers. However, this cannot be said about the performance when used while using them amid Delhi traffic.The Transparency mode allowed ample ambient noise to pass through, providing a natural listening experience. Meanwhile, the Adaptive mode was a little unpredictable and wasn’t on point.Coming to head tracking (a spatial audio feature that uses sensors and gyroscopes alongside a source of surround sound audio to construct a virtual 3D space) also worked satisfactorily. Watching movies like Avatar: The Way Of Water, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and Vikram on these earbuds offered an immersive and lifelike experience.Moto Buds+ feature responsive touch controls, which can be also customised via the Moto Buds app. The app also offers a ‘fit test’ to ensure the perfect placement of the buds.Default gestures include double-tap to answer/end calls or play/pause media, triple-tap for previous/next track, and long tap for noise control. The touch controls are accurate and intuitive.We liked the Moto Buds app’s features like battery percentage display, noise control mode selection, customisation options for touch control, and EQ settings. The app also includes a “Find My Buds” feature to help locate misplaced earbuds.Other features like in-ear detection – where music automatically pauses when you remove an earbud – worked smoothly. This feature helped us to get into conversations while listening to music.For connectivity, the Moto Buds+ use Bluetooth 5.3 , which ensures a stable and low-latency connection. These new earbuds also support Google's Fast Pair technology for quick and easy pairing with Android devices. However, Motorola has confirmed that these earbuds will soon be able to connect with iPhones as well.The earbuds also support dual-device connectivity. Mostly the feature worked fine but minor adjustments were needed on rare occasions to make it work properly.The Moto Buds+ earphones impress with their long-lasting battery life. With Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and Hi-Res mode activated, the earbuds offer around five hours of continuous playback. However, disabling these features extended the battery life to approximately seven hours.When including the charging from the case, the earphones offered a total playback time of more than 30 hours and allowed for nearly five full recharges of the earbuds before we needed to recharge the case.The Moto Buds+ also support fast charging and can deliver up to 2.5 hours of playback with just a 10-minute charge. Charging the case can be done via a USB-C cable, and for added convenience, the case also supports Qi-compatible wireless charging.The Moto Buds+ are a fine option to consider for Android users if they’re in the market looking for mid-range TWS earbuds. The earbuds will work especially for those seeking a balance of features, comfort and audio quality.At their price, the earbuds offer good audio, multiple customisation options, impressive comfort and a commendable battery life. These earbuds are also very good for gaming, podcasts and videos.Overall, the Moto Buds+ are a formidable contender in the mid-range true wireless earbuds market, especially for those looking for a well-rounded package at a reasonable price.","The Moto Buds+ are Motorola's latest, most premium TWS offering in India.

How setting your AC to the default temperature is important



Humidity can force you to decrease temperature



Proper airflow will cool your room faster



Smart ACs can add to convenience



Finding the perfect balance between staying cool and maintaining energy efficiency becomes a priority as the scorching summer heat takes hold. There is one question that often arises among users: What is the ideal temperature for the air conditioning (AC) while sleeping?Well, the answer isn’t straightforward. Let us explain…A government advisory has shared in consultation with the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) fixed the default temperature according to new energy performance standards for Room Air Conditioner (RACs)., the advisory says.Setting the right temperature while sleeping can also save your electricity bills . Air conditioners consume more energy to maintain lower temperatures. The closer the indoor temperature is to the outdoor temperature, the less the AC has to work, resulting in lower energy consumption.By setting your AC to an optimal temperature while you sleep, you can significantly reduce energy usage and save on electricity bills . Also, setting the temperature to 18 won’t make your AC cool faster but will consume more electricity. So it’s better to keep the AC in its default temperature.High humidity can make a room feel warmer than it is.

US arrests Chinese man for running the world's largest zombie network with these 6 malicious VPN apps,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-arrests-chinese-man-for-running-the-worlds-largest-zombie-network-with-these-6-malicious-vpn-apps/articleshow/110599335.cms,"How hackers installed ransomware in devices

Tips to protect yourself

Avoid free software, especially VPNs bundled with pirated content. These can contain hidden malware.

Steer clear of suspicious websites and ads. Clicking on them can unknowingly download malware.

Don't open attachments or click links in emails from unknown senders, especially if they seem urgent or request personal information.

Regularly update antivirus and operating systems to ensure they can identify the latest threats.

The US Justice Department, in collaboration with international agencies, has arrested a Chinese national who has been pushing malware onto victims' devices using multiple malicious VPN applications . This is said to be the “the largest ever operation against botnets, which play a major role in the deployment of ransomware "" on a global level.YunHe Wang , along with his conspirators, had been running the 911 S5 – one of the largest residential proxy services and botnet -- that has compromised over 19 million IP addresses in over 190 countries and confirmed victim losses in the billions of dollars.“Working with our international partners, the FBI conducted a joint, sequenced cyber operation to dismantle the 911 S5 Botnet—likely the world's largest botnet ever. We arrested its administrator, Yunhe Wang, seized infrastructure and assets, and levied sanctions against Wang and his co-conspirators,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray.The ‘free’ VPN applications that hackers used to attack users globally include MaskVPN, DewVPN, PaladinVPN, ProxyGate, ShieldVPN, and ShineVPN.The 911 S5 botnet infected devices through hidden malware disguised as ""proxy backdoors"" embedded within free, fake VPN applications. These VPNs were often bundled with pirated software and video games, tricking victims into downloading them.Once the VPN app is downloaded, it would install silently, turning the victim's device into part of the botnet without their knowledge.“The proxy backdoor enabled 911 S5 users to re-route their devices through victims' devices, allowing criminals to carry out crimes such as bomb threats, financial fraud, identity theft, child exploitation, and initial access brokering,” the FBI saidThe FBI and partner agencies recommend that people should take precautions to protect themselves against botnets:","The 911 S5 botnet infected devices through hidden malware disguised as ""proxy backdoors"" embedded within free, fake VPN applications.

As India undergoes its largest democratic exercise, the Lok Sabha Elections 2024 , WhatsApp’s Tipline has emerged as a crucial tool for combating the spread of deepfakes and misinformation. Created by the Misinformation Combat Alliance’s (MCA) Deepfakes Analysis Unit (DAU), the Tipline aims to raise public awareness and provide assistance in identifying AI-manipulated content.: Launched in March 2024, WhatsApp’s Tipline has quickly become a trusted resource for users seeking to verify the authenticity of images and videos. Since its inception, the Tipline has received hundreds of messages from users asking for help in distinguishing real from fake content.: The Tipline is accessible in multiple languages, including Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and English, making it widely usable across India’s diverse linguistic landscape.Users can flag suspected deepfake content by sending audio notes or videos to the Tipline. The process is listed below:Most of the manipulated content received involves doctored videos where the original audio is altered using AI to make a person appear to say something they did not. These videos often feature prominent figures such as actors, businessmen, politicians, and TV anchors. Additionally, AI-created memes of politicians using face-blending techniques or other less sophisticated methods have been commonly reported.WhatsApp’s Tipline uses advanced generative AI to analyze and detect deepfakes. This involves reconstructing the mouth movements of subjects to sync with altered audio, making the deepfakes appear more convincing.Pamposh Raina, Head of the DAU, emphasized the collaborative nature of the DAU’s approach. By partnering with detection and forensic experts, the DAU supports its fact-checking partners who play a critical role in this project. Raina stated, “The strength of the DAU lies in the collaborative model which it is building by partnering with detection and forensic experts. Our goal is to drive public awareness on the issue of algorithm-based fabrication, and I am confident that this symbiotic model can be replicated globally to combat misinformation spread through audio and video content produced using generative AI.”The successful implementation of WhatsApp’s Tipline during the Lok Sabha elections 2024 highlights the potential of such tools in combating misinformation. As deepfake technology continues to evolve, the need for robust detection and public awareness mechanisms becomes increasingly critical. WhatsApp’s initiative sets a precedent for similar efforts worldwide, showcasing how technology and collaboration can effectively address the challenges posed by AI-generated misinformation.",WhatsApp’s Tipline uses advanced generative AI to analyze and detect deepfakes.
