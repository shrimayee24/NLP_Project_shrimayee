Inside Josh Allen’s SUPER SIZED Car Collection

Also Read:

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen has built a reputation as one of the NFL’s most dominant player, but his success off the field is just as visible - especially when it comes to what’s parked in his garage. From rugged trucks built for harsh Buffalo winters to high-end luxury and speed machines, Allen’s car collection reflects both his personality and his journey from small-town roots to NFL superstardom.Allen’s rise in the NFL has been matched by a major financial leap. After signing a six-year, $258 million contract extension with the Bills in 2021, the quarterback gained the freedom to indulge in his love for powerful vehicles. Yet, his choices suggest balance rather than excess. Many of Allen’s cars are built for utility and durability, fitting for a quarterback who plays in one of the league’s coldest markets.One of the cars of his garage is the Jeep Grand Wagoneer, a full-size SUV powered by a twin-turbo V8 engine. With all-wheel drive and a spacious, luxury-filled interior, it’s a practical choice for Buffalo winters while still offering premium comfort.Allen has never hidden his appreciation for trucks, a nod to his upbringing in Firebaugh, California. His Ford F-150 Raptor, customized in an all-black finish, stands out as one of the most rugged vehicles he owns. Equipped with a powerful V8 engine and impressive ground clearance, the Raptor is built for tough terrain and poor weather, ideal for Western New York conditions.Adding to the SUV-heavy lineup is the Range Rover Sport, which blends performance, off-road ability, and luxury. With a refined interior and strong engine options, the Range Rover offers Allen a smoother, more polished driving experience without sacrificing strength.Allen’s garage also features vehicles that lean more toward style and speed. The Mercedes-Benz G-Wagon, known for its boxy design and elite status, brings both luxury and brute force. Its V8 engine and plush interior make it a favorite among elite athletes, and Allen is no exception.For pure American muscle, Allen owns a Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat. With nearly 800 horsepower under the hood, the Hellcat is the most aggressive car in his collection, designed for straight-line speed and raw performance.Rounding out the collection is Allen’s most exotic ride, the Aston Martin Vantage. Sleek, fast, and unmistakably premium, the Vantage represents Allen’s taste for high-end performance cars. Capable of accelerating from 0–60 mph in just over three seconds, it’s a clear departure from his trucks and SUVs, offering a glimpse into his appreciation for refined speed.Josh Allen’s car collection isn’t about flash alone. It mirrors his journey grounded, powerful, and versatile.","Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen has built a reputation as one of the NFL’s most dominant player.

The Pixel 10’s Imagination PowerVR GPU has been bumped from driver version 1.602.400 to 1.634.2906.

The system’s driverInfo now reports version 25.1, matching Imagination’s August release.

Vulkan conformanceVersion is listed as 1.4.1.0, confirming support for Vulkan 1.4.

The update is expected to reach stable builds in a future Pixel Drop once it exits beta.

Google Pixel 10 series: Specs, Design & Features That We Know!

Why the update maters





Google has started rolling out a much-awaited GPU driver update for the latest Pixel 10 smartphone series. As reported by Android Authority the update comes with Android 16 QPR3 Beta 1 and it aligns with Imagination Technologies’ August driver release, introducing support for Vulkan 1.4 and enhanced compatibility. The update seems to be quite meaningful on paper, but its impact on the performance is yet to be seen. “The update bumps the GPU driver from version 1.602.400 to 1.634.2906, and more importantly, the system’s driverInfo now reports version 25.1.

The state of AI adoption





American billionaire and entrepreneur Mark Cuban has now urged the young engineers entering the job market to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (MNCs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI). Cuban feels that smaller companies offer better platform for new graduates to make an immediate impact, while large corporations often dilute individual contributions.Speaking in an interview with CNBC and on his podcast The Dumbest Guy in the Room, Cuban explained that smaller companies are mainly entrepreneur-driven and they lack the deep IT departments or larger corporations. This gap creates opportunities for fresh graduates which directly contribute to the AI projects.“Small- to medium-size companies don’t have that depth. They are typically entrepreneurially driven and don’t have the flexibility to have people research things. Bringing a new graduate on to work on agentic AI projects is inexpensive for them and can get them immediate results,” Cuban said.Cuban also used the example of his own company, Cost Plus Drugs, noting how AI can automate processes to boost productivity, competitiveness, and profitability.Cuban argued that in big organisations, AI skills may not stand out as they are common among thousands of IT employees. On the other hand, in smaller firms often lack such expertise, making new graduates with AI knowledge invaluable. He also compared the present wave of AI with early days of the internet, when young engineers were hired to implement new technologies because they were more comfortable with them than older executives.Cuban also highlighted that 95% of companies have not yet seen measurable revenue returns from AI investments. The exceptions, he said, are mostly early-stage startups led by young entrepreneurs who design their processes around AI models tailored to their businesses.He urged his children and other young people to learn as much as possible about AI, stressing that companies are still grappling with how to use the technology for competitive advantage.",Mark Cuban has urged young engineers to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (MNCs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence.

"Aadhaar face authentication: How the new rules enable secure, consent-based offline verification for events, hotels, and deliveries",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/aadhaar-face-authentication-how-the-new-rules-enable-secure-consent-based-offline-verification-for-events-hotels-and-deliveries/articleshow/126032715.cms,"Need to update your Aadhar card? Here’s how you can book an appointment online

Understanding face authentication: New Aadhaar verification method

Significance of face authentication in Aadhaar verification

Aadhaar privacy and consent: Ensuring secure identity verification





Face authentication has been legitimised by the Unique Identification Authority of India ( UIDAI ), marking it as a significant change in handling online identities. This technology enables Aadhaar cardholders to authenticate their Aadhaar online by using their faces and matching them with their Aadhaar enrolment photo. This is facilitated by giving utmost importance to their consent, allowing them to manage their data whenever and however they feel like. Rules have been updated under Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP), making offline Aadhaar verification possible so that Aadhaar credentials are secured without reliance on online servers. With the launch of an updated Aadhaar application soon, operations involving events, hotel check-ins, deliveries, and access are expected to become easier and more privacy-oriented.Face recognition is a 1:1 consented method of verification. The facial image taken during the time of verification is matched with the Aadhar photo present in the UIDAI giant database at the time of enrolment. On successful matching, the identity of the individual is established. In contrast to fingerprinting and iris scanning, face recognition can be easily done even in scenarios where other biometric verification systems are not convenient or even feasible, for instance, at the time of entering an event, hotel, or gated community.Previously, face verification had very limited legal recognition and mainly only applied to governmental functions. Currently, the new set of rules by Aadhaar gives full legal recognition to face verification as a valid legal means of verification, along with OTP, biometric, and other secure means. It also significantly enhances offline verification of Aadhaar by allowing users to conveniently share digitally signed copies of credentials through trusted apps or QR codes without needing to directly access the UIDAI server.The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) organised a webinar on offline Aadhaar verification before the launch of the Aadhaar App. More than 250 people attended the webinar and learned about the functionality and uses of offline Aadhaar verification. UIDAI informed the participants how this process helps with the secure verification of identity without compromising identity protection by not requiring the Aadhaar cards themselves.This Aadhaar App will enable the user to share their own or their select family members’ Aadhaar information and provide advanced features for identity protection and updates by mobile or address. Face authentication proves the presence of the Aadhaar card holder at the verification location and satisfies the proof of presence criterion by confirming the Aadhaar card holder’s presence at the verification location. UIDAI officials state that face authentication doesn’t send any authentication information to the central server, and hence face authentication or face recognition technology is secure and superior to the previous methods.According to PIB , the key aspect highlighted in the new guidelines is that Aadhaar must only be used for specific reasons and must follow the consent mechanism. Individuals must now have the authority to accept or reject any Aadhaar-related verification, as well as the facility to disclose only certain information, including age or photo, but not the entire Aadhaar details. This, again, is in accordance with the DPDP Act, which strictly lays down the measures to avoid any potential abuse of personal data.","Face recognition is a 1:1 consented method of verification.

The United Arab Emirates is currently in the grip of a notable weather disturbance that is bringing rainfall, strong winds, cooler temperatures and rough seas across much of the country. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has been issuing regular forecasts and alerts as this system moves through, affecting daily life from road conditions to marine safety.Forecasters describe the situation as unstable weather, with convective cloud formations driving intermittent to heavy rain, moderate to strong winds and variable skies, from partly cloudy to overcast. Residents from Fujairah to Abu Dhabi should expect these conditions to persist through at least Friday, with a gradual easing anticipated over the weekend.The ""main rainfall wave"" is expected to reach its height between Thursday, December 18, and Friday, December 19. The NCM reports that the system began in the western regions and is gradually moving eastward.Authorities confirm that this instability is driven by a deep low-pressure system moving from the Red Sea, colliding with a cold air mass in the upper atmosphere.With visibility expected to drop significantly due to blowing dust and heavy rain, Dubai and Abu Dhabi Police have issued urgent safety warnings. Beyond the physical danger of wet roads, motorists face stiff penalties for reckless behavior. Officials have highlighted several ""non-negotiable"" rules to keep the public safe:The unsettled weather coincides with a historic milestone for Dubai International Airport (DXB), which is expecting a record-breaking 8.7 million passengers this month.Travelers are being urged to head to the airport much earlier than usual to avoid road delays on major highways like the E11 and E311. While flight operations are generally resilient, heavy thunderstorms could lead to minor schedule adjustments or gate holds.At sea, the situation is even more precarious. The NCM has issued a ""rough to very rough"" warning for the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman. Winds are expected to gust up to 65 km/h, whipping up sand and causing waves to swell. Marine enthusiasts and boat owners are strictly advised to stay on shore until conditions stabilize.As the rain clouds begin to clear toward the end of the weekend, a noticeable chill will settle over the Emirates. Temperatures are set to drop steadily, with daytime highs falling to 24°C in Dubai and 23°C in Abu Dhabi. The inland city of Al Ain could see the mercury dip as low as 21°C during the day and a crisp 10°C at night.By Saturday evening, the heavy downpours are expected to subside, leaving only scattered clouds over northern and eastern areas. Sunday will bring a much quieter end to the week, though rising humidity could lead to misty mornings in western regions.","The United Arab Emirates is currently in the grip of a notable weather disturbance that is bringing rainfall, strong winds, cooler temperatures and rough seas.

Where HAMMER fits in India’s precision strike ecosystem









India’s decision to manufacture the HAMMER precision-guided air-to-ground weapon marks a quiet but consequential shift in how New Delhi is preparing for future conflict. More than a new addition to the arsenal, HAMMER represents a move away from importing finished munitions towards absorbing the technologies that define modern air warfare.Developed by France’s Safran Electronics & Defense, HAMMER is a modular precision strike system designed to hit targets from stand-off ranges while keeping aircraft outside heavily defended airspace. Its architecture combines guidance kits, propulsion and standard bomb bodies, allowing rapid adaptation across missions and platforms. The system is already combat-proven and integrated with aircraft such as the Rafale.Under a new agreement, Bharat Electronics Limited and Safran will jointly manufacture, customise, supply and maintain HAMMER in India through a 50-50 joint venture. The weapon will be integrated across multiple platforms, including the Rafale and the indigenous Tejas light combat aircraft, creating a common precision strike capability across both imported and home-grown fleets.At a time when air power is defined less by numbers and more by accuracy, stand-off reach and controlled escalation, the localisation of HAMMER signals a strategic shift from buying weapons to mastering precision strike technology itself.The Indian Air Force deployed HAMMER precision-guided weapons during Operation Sindoor on 7 May 2025 as part of a carefully calibrated cross-border strike against terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Operation Sindoor was launched in retaliation for the Pahalgam terrorist attack that killed 26 civilians on April 22. A total of nine sites were struck, including Jaish-e-Mohammed’s primary base in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba’s hub in Muridke.Weapon selection was central to the operation’s objectives. The Indian Air Force employed a layered mix of SCALP cruise missiles, HAMMER precision-guided bombs and loitering munitions.Within this mix, HAMMER was used where flexibility and adaptability were essential. Its modular design and multiple guidance options allowed the IAF to tailor strikes based on the nature of individual targets and real-time assessments.HAMMER enabled stand-off engagement without requiring aircraft to fly directly over heavily defended areas. Its off-axis launch capability reduced exposure to Pakistan’s air defence network, particularly in areas close to population centres and sensitive military zones.The weapon’s precision supported the operation’s political and military messaging by reducing the risk of collateral damage. By pairing HAMMER with SCALP, the Indian Air Force demonstrated a layered strike doctrine, with SCALP neutralising deep, hardened targets and HAMMER engaging medium-range sites requiring precision and manoeuvrability.HAMMER, short for Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range, officially designated as AASM from the French Armement Air-Sol Modulaire, is a precision-guided air-to-ground stand-off weapon designed to bridge the gap between conventional bombs and cruise missiles.Despite often being described as a missile, HAMMER is fundamentally a guided bomb system. At its core is a standard unguided bomb, which becomes a high-precision strike weapon once fitted with modular guidance and propulsion kits. This design allows air forces to convert existing bomb inventories into modern precision weapons without developing entirely new missiles for each mission profile.The system is built around two main components. The first is a nose-mounted guidance section that determines how the weapon navigates and locks onto its target. Depending on the mission, this guidance kit can combine inertial navigation and GPS for all-weather strikes, infrared imaging for high-precision attacks on fixed targets, or laser guidance for engaging moving targets.The second component is a tail-mounted range extension kit, which includes a solid-fuel rocket booster and manoeuvrable winglets. Once released, the booster ignites to increase stand-off range, while the winglets allow the weapon to alter its flight path, perform sharp turns and attack targets from off-axis angles. In combat, this enables launch aircraft to remain outside heavily defended airspace while still striking accurately.HAMMER kits can be attached to bombs weighing 125 kilograms, 250 kilograms, 500 kilograms and 1,000 kilograms, including widely used Mark 80 series bombs. This scalability allows the same weapon system to be used against a range of targets, from lightly protected structures to hardened bunkers.In operational use, HAMMER has demonstrated the ability to strike targets from significant distances, engage multiple targets in a single sortie and maintain accuracy in contested environments. Its combination of modularity, manoeuvrability and precision makes it particularly suited to modern air operations where speed, flexibility and controlled escalation are critical.In modern air warfare, weapons fall broadly into three categories: unguided bombs, guided bombs and air-to-surface missiles.Unguided bombs are cheap but inaccurate and require aircraft to fly directly over targets. Air-to-surface missiles offer long range and precision but are expensive and limited in numbers.HAMMER sits between these two extremes. It offers missile-like precision and stand-off range while retaining the flexibility and lower cost structure of a guided bomb.This distinction matters. Guided bombs like HAMMER allow air forces to carry larger numbers of precision weapons, adapt them to multiple target types and deploy them from a wide range of aircraft.The defining feature of HAMMER is modularity. Instead of designing a single fixed weapon, Safran developed a system where guidance, propulsion and bomb body can be mixed and matched.The nose-mounted guidance kit determines how the weapon finds and tracks its target. The rear-mounted range extension kit determines how far it can travel after release and how sharply it can manoeuvre.This modular architecture allows the same basic weapon to be used for close air support, deep strike, bunker busting and attacks on moving targets, depending on the guidance kit selected.For India, this means fewer weapon types to manage logistically while retaining operational flexibility.HAMMER is available in three primary guidance configurations.The baseline version combines an inertial navigation system and a Global Positioning System receiver. Data from both systems is fused using Kalman filtering, allowing the weapon to maintain accuracy even if GPS signals are degraded or jammed. This variant achieves a circular error probability of around 10 metres and works in all weather conditions.The second variant adds infrared homing to the INS and GPS combination. This system matches the target area with a reference image stored in the weapon’s memory, allowing accuracy of around one metre. It works day and night in fair weather and is particularly useful against fixed targets with a clear thermal signature.The third variant replaces infrared homing with laser guidance. This allows HAMMER to strike moving targets, provided they are illuminated by a laser designator from an aircraft, drone or ground team. This version was qualified in April 2013.These variants were redesignated in 2010 as SBU-38, SBU-64 and SBU-54 respectively, with the overall system renamed HAMMER for export.HAMMER’s range depends on launch altitude and configuration. Safran cites a range of over 32 nautical miles from high altitude and around 8 nautical miles from low-level release.The winglets and rocket booster allow off-axis launches of up to 90 degrees, meaning the aircraft does not have to point directly at the target. This reduces exposure to enemy air defences.Multiple HAMMER weapons can be released in a single pass against different targets with one trigger press, a capability that significantly enhances strike efficiency.HAMMER entered service in 2007 with the French Air Force and Naval Aviation on the Rafale platform.Its combat debut came in Afghanistan in April 2008, when a Rafale dropped two HAMMER weapons in support of ground troops.The system gained wider attention during the 2011 Libya campaign. A HAMMER weapon destroyed a Libyan Air Force G-2 Galeb aircraft on the runway at Misrata Airport shortly after it landed. Another strike destroyed a Libyan tank at a distance of 55 kilometres. In total, 225 HAMMER weapons were used in Libya.This combat history is critical. Weapons that have been tested in real conflicts carry credibility in terms of reliability, accuracy and resistance to countermeasures.India ordered large numbers of HAMMER weapons in September 2020. Deliveries were completed by November 2020, with the French Air and Space Force transferring part of its own stock to ensure immediate availability.The Indian Air Force initially integrated HAMMER on the Rafale fleet. Work has since begun to integrate it onto the Tejas, a process that involves complex software, avionics and flight control modifications.Successful integration on Tejas would represent a major step in combining imported high-end weapons with indigenous platforms.According to France’s Senate committee on defence manufacturing costs, the total cost of the AASM programme including development and delivery of 2,348 kits was €846 million, placing the per-weapon cost at around $300,000.Earlier figures showed a unit cost of €164,000 excluding development and €252,000 including development. By 2017, Safran reported a unit cost of €120,000 for the AASM Evolution version, with a target of reducing it to €80,000 through larger production runs.For India, domestic production offers the potential to lower costs over time while ensuring availability during crises.India today operates a layered precision strike inventory.Indigenous systems include the Sudarshan Laser Guided Bomb, the Smart Anti-Airfield Weapon, and glide bombs such as Gaurav and Garuthmaa.Imported and jointly developed systems include the SPICE series from Israel, HAMMER from France and the BrahMos-A supersonic cruise missile.HAMMER fills a crucial middle ground between short-range guided bombs and long-range cruise missiles, offering flexibility, precision and affordability.Manufacturing HAMMER in India is not just about supply security. It allows Indian engineers and technicians to gain deep familiarity with guidance systems, propulsion integration and precision strike workflows.This knowledge is transferable to future indigenous weapons programmes and reduces long-term dependence on foreign suppliers for upgrades and maintenance.The deal also strengthens India’s defence partnership with France at a time when New Delhi is diversifying beyond traditional suppliers.The BEL–Safran HAMMER joint venture represents a quiet but important shift in India’s approach to air warfare. Precision, modularity and adaptability are now central to how air power is conceived and deployed.By moving HAMMER production to Indian soil, New Delhi is not merely acquiring a weapon. It is acquiring the ability to understand, modify and eventually design the tools of modern precision strike warfare.","India’s decision to manufacture the HAMMER precision-guided air-to-ground weapon marks a quiet but consequential shift in how New Delhi is preparing for future conflict. HAMMER represents a move away from importing finished munitions towards absorbing the technologies that define modern air warfare. The weapon will be integrated across multiple platforms, including the indigenous Tejas light combat aircraft.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125981989,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image.jpg"

A pleasant and peaceful performance at Hangzhou Safari Park in East China’s Zhejiang Province on Saturday turned terrifying when a black bear suddenly attacked its keeper.Several videos are going viral on social media, showing audience members watching as two keepers guided two black bears onto the stage for another round of performance. One bear successfully performed, while the other, nearing the stage, pounced on its keeper and knocked him to the ground, Global News reported.The fallen keeper struggled to escape while nearby staff grabbed chairs and poles to separate the animal. After the bear was pulled away, it lunged at the keeper again, and staff had to use force to separate them.This footage prompted an online debate over whether animal performances should be banned. Other staff immediately intervened and used props to separate the bear from the keeper. Multiple social media users posted videos of the incident recorded during the bears’ show.The park explained that the incident occurred as the keeper was carrying a large bag of carrots and apples; the bear saw the bag, became excited, and pounced on the keeper in an attempt to get the food, according to the notice. The notice also stated that the keeper said the incident reminded him to be more careful in dealings with the bear in the future.The official social media account of Hangzhou Safari Park posted a notice on Saturday stating that neither the keeper nor the bear was injured.One user, Momo, on the China's social media platform commented, “Safety must be a priority, and we should have respect for animals. Never think of them as cute and docile, or that we can control them.”Another user, Zero Geqian Qianqian, also emphasised the need to focus on safety. Many others have called for the cancellation of animal performances. A user named “Don’t Call Me Ma Ma Ma” asked, “When will animal performances be canceled? Isn’t it in animals’ nature to be food-driven and protective of their food?”Some users expressed sympathy for the bear. A user named “The Girl is Out, I’m at Home” said, “A small bear is like a little baby. How could we make it perform? If it has apples, let it eat! If it were your child, would you make it perform first and then eat? If it’s hungry, then let it perform how to eat, it would be happier, the keeper and the bear would be more harmonious, and the audience would still enjoy it.”On the X also, several users commented on the video. One of the user said, ""I see why the Russians train with them 🤣🤣🤣 that bear is a professional grappler.""Another said, ""Maybe if we didn't lock these animals up for our own amusement they wouldn't attack people.""After the video of the bear attack went viral online and sparked debate, the park released a follow-up video showing that the bear and the keeper have since “reconciled.” While feeding the black bear carrots, the keeper gently petted its head and said, “If you want carrots, why did you snatch mine? [Even if you didn’t], I’ll still give you some.” The black bear stood calmly and ate peacefully, displaying a gentle demeanour.",A black bear suddenly attacked its keeper at Hangzhou Safari Park in East China's Zhejiang Province on Saturday.

Saudi Arabia Earthquake 2025

The epicenter



Impact

No injuries or casualties have been reported.

No structural damage to buildings or infrastructure was observed.

Neighboring countries, including the UAE, were completely unaffected. The NCM specifically noted that the tremor was not felt by residents in the Emirates and posed no threat to the country’s coastal areas.

The bigger picture

The fourth notable tremor

April 2025: A 4.0 magnitude quake struck 55 km east of Jubail.

July 2025: A stronger 5.1 magnitude tremor was recorded near the Farasan Islands in the south.

October 2025: A 4.34 magnitude quake hit the Arabian Gulf, northeast of Khafji.

December 2025: The current 4.3 magnitude event in the Eastern Province.





Residents of Saudi Arabia ’s Eastern Province experienced an unexpected start to their Wednesday morning as a moderate earthquake rippled through the region, briefly unsettling communities while remaining under close monitoring by authorities. The tremor was felt across several areas, prompting residents to share their experiences online, while official monitoring agencies confirmed that no immediate damage or injuries were reported.In the early hours of Wednesday, December 17, 2025, a 4.3-magnitude earthquake shook the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The tremor was recorded at 2:11 am (UAE time) at a depth of about 50 kilometers beneath the surface, according to the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) of the UAE and seismic data from Saudi authorities.Seismologists describe this level of earthquake as moderate, strong enough to be measured clearly by instruments but unlikely to cause significant damage at the surface.The quake’s epicenter was in Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province, a region that sits near the Arabian Gulf. While Saudi Arabia isn’t commonly thought of as a hotbed of seismic activity, the Arabian Plate and adjacent fault systems are geologically active, making smaller tremors a routine scientific observation.Past quakes of similar strengths, including earlier 4.3-magnitude events detected offshore near Jubail, have been tracked by monitoring networks without causing harm.Experts explain that these events often reflect the slow movement of tectonic plates, such as the Arabian Plate pushing against neighboring plates like the Eurasian Plate. This stress occasionally releases as minor tremors across the wider Gulf region.Despite the 4.3 magnitude, which is classified as a ""light"" to ""moderate"" earthquake, authorities have been quick to reassure the public. The Saudi Geological Survey (SGS) and regional weather centers confirmed that:While Saudi Arabia isn’t typically known for frequent major earthquakes, the region does experience occasional seismic activity, particularly along its fault lines in the Red Sea and near the Arabian Gulf.Experts from the Saudi Geological Survey emphasize that the National Seismic Monitoring Network is constantly active, tracking every minor shift in the earth's crust. This network provides real-time data to ensure that any potential threats are identified and communicated to the public instantly.Understanding the science behind small tremors helps communities stay informed without unnecessary alarm.This midnight event marks the fourth notable seismic occurrence within the Kingdom or its immediate coastal waters this year. This series of minor quakes highlights the ongoing tectonic adjustments in the region:Geologists explain that these frequent but minor events are often caused by the Arabian Tectonic Plate slowly colliding with the Eurasian Plate. Rather than a cause for alarm, experts see these as natural ""pressure releases"" that prevent the buildup of much larger, more destructive energy.For those living in the Eastern Province, this event serves as a gentle reminder of nature’s power. Geologists suggest that small tremors like these are often just the earth releasing built-up pressure in a safe, non-destructive way. As of now, the situation is entirely stable, and daily life continues as normal across the Kingdom.","A 4.3-magnitude earthquake shook the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia.

Supplier licences like the one obtained by Sportradar, a major sports data and betting services provider, further strengthening the ecosystem for regulated online sports wagering and gaming.

How to download Play971?





The United Arab Emirates has taken a major step into the world of regulated online gaming and sports betting with the launch of its first licensed internet gaming and sports wagering website. The platform, called Play971, is officially authorised and regulated by the General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA), the federal body responsible for supervising all commercial gaming activity in the country.Play971 is operated by Coin Technology Projects LLC, a firm incorporated in Abu Dhabi with its main base at Twofour54 Yas Creative Hub, and claims to be fully “located, licensed and regulated in the UAE.” This launch marks a significant milestone for a country that has long been known for strict anti-gambling laws rooted in cultural and religious norms.Play971’s debut represents more than just a new website. It introduces a regulated environment for real-money online games and sports wagering that did not exist before under UAE law. The platform includes a range of casino-style games and sports betting markets, including popular events like football and tennis.Under the supervision of the GCGRA, players and operators must follow strict responsible gaming standards, including systems to verify user identity and ensure that only eligible participants within the UAE can access the service. This controlled launch currently applies in certain emirates such as Abu Dhabi and Ras Al Khaimah, with broader availability expected in early 2026 as the regulatory framework and licensing system evolves.This early rollout serves as a test case for future operators, and regulators continue to refine licensing categories, supplier approvals and compliance rules so that the market expands safely and transparently.The UAE’s move toward regulated online gaming builds on multiple earlier steps. In 2024, the first official lottery licence was awarded to The Game LLC, beginning regulated draw operations with major prizes.According to the General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA), internet gaming is considered a form of “commercial gaming conducted via the internet, using computers, mobile phones, or other digital devices with access to websites or apps that offer games and bets involving chance, skill, or a combination of both.” The regulator notes that these games include bingo, casino games such as slots and poker, eSports, fantasy games, peer-to-peer games, skill-based games, sports betting, and more.On sports wagering specifically, the GCGRA explains that it “involves betting on the outcome of sports events or the performance of athletes or teams,” and that wagers can only be placed legally through licensed operators and sportsbooks.Separately, the GCGRA has also issued:Together, these moves show the UAE modernising its commercial gaming landscape with a regulated, consumer-safe framework rather than a permissive or unregulated market.At launch, Play971 is accessible primarily through its official website, rather than via public app stores. Users can register and play directly online, following identity verification and eligibility checks required by the UAE’s gaming regulator.As of now, no standalone mobile app has been publicly listed on major platforms such as Apple’s App Store or Google Play. This cautious approach aligns with the UAE’s tightly controlled regulatory rollout, ensuring compliance with responsible gaming and digital licensing standards before wider distribution.According to industry observers and regulatory context shared in official announcements, any future mobile app rollout, whether on iOS or Android, would require separate approvals from the General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA), as well as compliance with platform-specific policies.The availability of Play971 is also being introduced in phases, with access currently aligned to emirates and jurisdictions where regulatory readiness has been confirmed, including Abu Dhabi and Ras Al Khaimah. Wider nationwide access is expected to follow only after regulators complete further reviews of system performance, consumer safeguards, and operational compliance.Officials have stressed that users should avoid unlicensed apps or websites claiming to offer UAE-approved betting services, as Play971 remains the only legally licensed online sports wagering and iGaming platform in the country at this stage.With the national lottery, casino-resort projects, vendor license and now Play971, the UAE is slowly but deliberately building a regulated commercial gaming ecosystem that is secure and transparent for consumers and operators alike.","The United Arab Emirates has taken a major step into the world of regulated online gaming and sports betting.

Saudi Arabia introduces ID Wristband Devices for child safety during Hajj and Umrah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-introduces-id-wristband-devices-for-child-safety-during-hajj-and-umrah/articleshow/125971558.cms,"Makkah Grand Mosque rolls out child safety bracelets / AI Generated Image

How do Child ID bracelets work?

Pilgrim safety during Hajj 2026

What should parents do?





The General Authority for the Care of the Grand Mosque and the Prophet’s Mosque in Saudi Arabia has launched a new child safety initiative at the holy site in Makkah this December. Under this programme, identification bracelets for children are now being issued to families as they enter the Grand Mosque complex. The goal is simple but powerful: ensure young pilgrims are quickly recognised and reunited with their guardians if they become lost or separated in the crowds.This initiative extends earlier versions of child wristband systems that were trialled and operated at key entrances in previous Umrah and Hajj seasons.The child safety bracelets are provided free of charge to families visiting the Grand Mosque with children. There is no online pre-registration required and no payment involved at any stage.Parents or guardians can obtain the bracelets on arrival at the Grand Mosque, where dedicated counters have been set up at key entry gates, including the King Abdulaziz Gate and King Fahd Gate (Gate 79). Trained staff from the mosque authority assist families at these points.The registration process is quick and done on the spot. Guardians are asked to provide basic contact details, such as a mobile phone number, which is then recorded on the bracelet.The bracelet is securely fastened to the child’s wrist before entry, ensuring the child can be easily identified if separated from their family.There is no age restriction specified, but the initiative is primarily aimed at young children, who are more vulnerable in dense crowds during Umrah and Hajj. Authorities strongly advise families with children to collect the bracelet before entering the prayer areas, especially during peak hours.Mosque officials have reiterated that the service is part of broader crowd-management and safety measures, and families are encouraged to use it as a preventive step rather than waiting for an emergency.The initiative is strongly encouraged for all guardians to utilize, especially during peak seasons when visitor numbers surge, such as the Holy Month of Ramadan and the annual Hajj pilgrimage. Authorities note that the system has successfully reduced reports of missing persons during these congested periods.Speaking on the objective of the program, officials have emphasized the importance of the service. Eng. Amjad Al-Hazmi, Deputy Head of the Presidency for Social and Voluntary Services, highlighted the organization’s ""utmost keenness on the provision of the finest and best services for the pilgrims"" and its commitment to ""raise the level of social responsibility."" Similarly, Khalid bin Fahad Al-Shalawi, Undersecretary-General for Social, Voluntary and Humanitarian Services, stated that the initiative ""supports parents and their children to perform their rituals peacefully. ""By providing this safety net, the Authority aims to give parents peace of mind, allowing them to focus fully on their spiritual obligations without the constant worry of losing their child in the crowd.Saudi authorities advise parents not to panic if a child becomes separated inside the Grand Mosque. With the safety bracelet in place, the recovery process is designed to be quick and orderly.If a child goes missing, parents should immediately inform the nearest security officer or mosque staff member and provide a description of the child. Staff are trained to look for the ID bracelet, which allows them to contact guardians directly using the information provided.Lost children are typically taken to designated assistance points inside the mosque complex, where trained personnel care for them until parents arrive. Authorities stress that most separations are resolved within a short time due to the coordinated system in place.This guidance helps parents understand that the bracelet works as part of a larger safety network, not as a standalone measure.Together with these innovations, the child bracelet programme reflects Saudi Arabia’s ongoing commitment to enhancing visitor experience while preserving safety, tradition, and hospitality at one of the world’s most sacred sites.","Saudi authorities have launched a new child safety initiative at the Grand Mosque in Makkah. Under this programme, identification bracelets for children are now being issued to families. The goal is to ensure young pilgrims are quickly recognised and reunited with their guardians if they become lost or separated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125971757,imgsize-29584,width-400,resizemode-4/child-safety-bracelet.jpg"

999: For all life-threatening emergencies.

901: For non-emergency reports or inquiries.

Driving rules and fines

Reduce Speed: Motorists must slow down immediately. Wet roads significantly increase braking distance and the risk of aquaplaning (skidding). Driving in foggy weather without turning on vehicle lights can incur an AED 400 fine and four black points.

400 fine and four black points. Increase Distance: Maintain a sufficient safety gap. The standard three-second rule should be increased to a minimum of five seconds between your vehicle and the one ahead.

Use Proper Lighting: Turn on low-beam headlights and use fog lights when visibility drops. Never use high beams, as the light reflects off the water droplets or fog, reducing visibility for everyone.

Check Your Car: Before setting out, verify that your tires, brakes, and headlights are working properly. Crucially, ensure your windshield wipers are functional and the washer fluid tank is full.

Stay Focused: Maintain full attention on the road at all times.Taking photos or filming the rain while driving is a serious violation resulting in an AED 800 fine and four black points.

Mandatory water safety

Avoid Flood Zones: Residents must stay clear of valleys (Wadis), water channels, and any areas prone to flash floods. The depth and force of moving water are often misjudged; it can take less than 12 inches of rapidly moving water to sweep a car away. AED 1,000 fine and six black points for gathering near valleys and flood zones.

Do Not Go Near the Sea: The public is strongly advised to avoid beaches and to refrain from any sailing or marine activities. Rough seas and strong waves can pose severe threats to even experienced sea-goers. Driving into a closed road or flooded valley, ignoring the instructions of the competent authority, results in an AED 2,000 fine, 23 black points, and 60 days of vehicle impoundment.

Marine Vessels: Owners and operators of boats, ships, and yachts are urged to closely monitor the latest weather forecasts and strictly comply with all issued navigation and safety instructions before considering setting sail.

Parkin Company PJSC, Dubai’s largest provider of paid parking facilities, confirmed it is aware of the incident. In a statement shared with, the company said all identified fraudulent QR codes have been removed. It also said that any QR codes that were misused have been updated to redirect users to the official Roads and Transport Authority website.Scammers typically place fake stickers over legitimate QR codes on parking signboards, making the tampering difficult to detect at first glance. All parking signages across Dubai feature QR codes that allow motorists to pay parking fees quickly and conveniently.

UAE and ongoing initiatives





The UAE Government has issued Federal Decree-Law No. (12) of 2025, a major legal reform focused on children of unknown parentage, that is, children whose biological parents are not legally identified or known. This law strengthens how the country cares for vulnerable children and ensures they grow up in safe, stable environments.The decree is part of the UAE’s ongoing efforts to update its child welfare framework following decades of legislative activity, including the existing Child Rights Law (formerly known as Wadeema’s Law).The new law reframes how children without known parents are cared for and supported. It does the following:Under the reform, all important decisions involving these children must fully reflect their physical, emotional, and social needs, including access to education, healthcare, and a secure family environment.This law builds on the existing Child Rights Law (Federal Law No. 3 of 2016), which already guarantees a broad set of protections for all children in the UAE, including protection from neglect, abuse, exploitation and discrimination.Children with unknown parentage often face complex legal and social challenges, such as lack of documentation, unclear affiliation, and difficulty accessing services. The new law aims to remove these barriers by:Experts welcomed the move as a logical continuation of the UAE’s child welfare strategy, which prioritizes safety, health, education and emotional development for all children, from newborns to teenagers.The new law aligns with other efforts in the UAE to strengthen child rights and safety. The Child Rights Law (Wadeema’s Law) already protects children against abuse, neglect, and psychological harm, and places priority on family and safe environments for children.Local forums and initiatives, such as the Child Safety Forum in Sharjah, bring authorities and experts together to promote best practices in child protection. Updated personal status and family laws in the UAE have also placed children’s welfare at the heart of legal reforms, including custody, support and identity issues.These developments show the UAE is working on multiple fronts to create a comprehensive child protection ecosystem, not just for children with known families but also for the most vulnerable who lack parental identity.The UAE’s Federal Decree-Law No. (12) of 2025 marks a significant step in modernizing and strengthening child protection laws. By focusing on the best interests of children with unknown parents, and ensuring stable care, rights, and opportunity, the country reinforces its long-standing commitment to children’s welfare and social inclusion.","The UAE Government has issued Federal Decree-Law No. (12) of 2025, a major legal reform focused on children of unknown parentage.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Pensioners play a vital role in the social fabric of our society, and their financial security is paramount. To ensure continued access to pension benefits, annual life certificate submissions are mandatory for all pensioners. This process, which verifies the pensioner's living status, has been streamlined through various online and offline methods. With the recent initiatives to promote digital submissions, pensioners can conveniently fulfil this requirement and maintain their financial support.The requirement for pensioners to submit their jeevan pramaan patra is a critical process in ensuring the integrity and sustainability of pension funds. By providing multiple submission methods—both online and offline—the government is making it easier for pensioners to comply with this requirement. The ongoing digital campaigns further illustrate the government’s commitment to enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of pension services, ensuring that pensioners receive their benefits without unnecessary delays.The submission window for life certificates opened on November 1 for pensioners under the age of 80. This is part of an annual cycle during which pensioners must reaffirm their eligibility for pension disbursement. The deadline for submitting the life certificate is November 30. If the certificate is not submitted by this deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting in December. This requirement also applies to super senior citizens (aged 80 and above), who were allowed to submit their certificates starting on October 1, with the same November 30 deadline.Pensioners can submit their life certificates through several methods, accommodating various preferences and technological capabilities. Here are the options available:For those choosing to submit their life certificates online through the Jeevan Pramaan Portal, the following steps are involved:For pensioners opting for offline submission, the process is straightforward:If pensioners fail to submit their life certificates by the stipulated deadline, their pension payments will be halted starting the following month. However, payments will resume once the life certificate is submitted, thereby ensuring that pensioners do not permanently lose access to their funds, provided they complete the required process.In an effort to facilitate the submission process, the Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare (DoPPW) has initiated its third nationwide digital life certificate (DLC) campaign. This campaign runs from November 1 to November 30, covering 800 cities and districts. The campaign aims to promote the use of digital platforms for certificate submission, ensuring greater accessibility for pensioners.On the first day of this campaign, over 1.8 lakh pensioners successfully generated their digital life certificates, highlighting the growing adoption of technology among pensioners.

Conclusion





For nearly two decades, the browser market appeared settled. Google Chrome has become the dominant gateway to the internet, holding more than 60% global market share, leaving rivals such as Microsoft's Edge, Firefox, Safari, and Opera fighting for relevance. But with the rise of generative and agentic artificial intelligence (AI), the basic idea of what a browser is—and what it should do—is being redefined. A wave of AI-first browsers and assistants is now challenging the long-standing architecture of the web, pushing tech giants into a new strategic conflict — the battle to control the interface through which people access information, complete tasks, and interact with AI.This competition intensified sharply this year. OpenAI launched ChatGPT Atlas, its dedicated AI browser. Perplexity rolled out Comet, a browser that embeds an intelligent agent capable of reading, summarizing, and acting across webpages. Opera revitalized its strategy with Neon, introducing built-in AI workflows and action tools. Then, in a major shift, Google recently launched Disco, an experimental browser built around generative AI—and, unlike the competition, it attempts to rethink browsing from first principles rather than layering AI onto existing structures.As Fortune reported, “AI is shaking up the browser market,” turning a previously stagnant category into a new frontier for competition. Meanwhile, Forbes argued that Google has advantages the public often overlooks, noting that while OpenAI launches flashy standalone products, Google quietly embeds AI across Search, Chrome, Gmail , Docs, and Android—the places where billions of users already spend their time. The result is that the AI browser war “may have been over before it began.”But inside the industry, the battle is only just starting, and the stakes are enormous. Whoever controls the interface layer—the browser, app, or AI agent users rely on—will control the future of online behaviour, advertising revenue, data flows, and attention. In this story, we try to analyze how we reached this turning point, why the major players are fighting so hard, and what it means for the future of the internet.When Google announced Disco earlier this month, it avoided positioning the product as a Chrome replacement. Instead, it specifically presented Disco as an experimental browser—a testbed for ideas that may later move into Chrome or Gemini-powered products. But the technology behind Disco represents one of the biggest conceptual shifts in how browsing could work.Disco’s most significant feature is GenTabs, an AI system powered by Gemini 3. Rather than opening multiple tabs and manually sorting information, GenTabs automatically analyses your activity and generates dynamic, personalized applications based on what you are doing.If one researches holiday destinations, GenTabs builds a trip planner with maps, suggesting itineraries, and saved references. If one explores recipes across different sites, it generates a cooking dashboard with ingredients and shopping lists. If one reviews academic papers, it produces learning tools, summaries, or visual concept maps.These aren’t simple summaries. Google says that GenTabs creates functional, interactive tools that behave like apps. While users can refine them with natural language prompts, all AI outputs link back to the original sources, maintaining transparency and accountability.This approach is fundamentally different from competitors. OpenAI’s Atlas, Perplexity’s Comet, and Microsoft Edge with Copilot mostly add AI sidebars or conversational layers onto existing browser structures. GenTabs reimagines browsing as a data synthesis activity rather than a page navigation exercise.Although Disco is currently limited to macOS and available via waitlist, its significance lies in what it signals: Google is testing what a post-Web browser might look like. The company has historically used Google Labs to experiment with bold ideas that sometimes end up in flagship products. The shift from individual tabs to AI-generated interfaces could mark a fundamental evolution of Chrome in the years ahead.As Forbes noted, Google has a decisive structural advantage: it “already owns the default behaviour of the web experience itself.” Rather than convincing users to download a new browser, Google can quietly deploy AI updates to billions of users—no friction, no shift in habits. That foundation is becoming increasingly important as competitors attempt to disrupt browsing from the outside.OpenAI’s launch of ChatGPT Atlas came with high expectations. During the launch, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called it a “once-a-decade opportunity to rethink what a browser can be.” Atlas introduces a number of AI-driven capabilities:Like Perplexity’s Comet and Opera’s Neon, Atlas is built on Chromium, the open-source browser engine maintained by Google. Chromium controls how pages load, how tabs are rendered, and how the browser interacts with the web.This dependence limits OpenAI in several ways:As explained in a Fortune article, “building a browser from scratch is extraordinarily difficult.” Even Microsoft abandoned its own engine to adopt Chromium for Edge. This leaves Atlas innovative, but constrained.OpenAI must convince hundreds of millions of users to download and switch to Atlas. That alone is a massive challenge. Chrome did not simply succeed because it was fast—it succeeded because Google distributed it through search results, preinstalls, Gmail notifications, and YouTube prompts.As Forbes notes, “Atlas may generate excitement in tech circles, but excitement doesn’t equal market position.” Chrome still controls the gateway to the web—and Google is fortifying that position through Gemini integration.While Google and OpenAI dominate the conversation, smaller players are pushing the boundaries in ways big companies may not attempt.Perplexity Comet blends a traditional web browser with a built-in AI agent that can:This approach positions Comet as a hybrid between a browser and a personal assistant. As Fortune notes in an article, an AI browser enables “both the human and AI model to access the web at the same time.” The agent can work in one tab while the user interacts with another—something standard chatbots cannot do.Comet also plays into Perplexity’s broader strategy: building AI search tools capable of competing with Google.Opera’s Neon introduces several AI-driven features, including Do – an action tool that performs operations directly on a webpage; Cards, which store workflow templates and saved prompts for repeated use; and built-in AI capabilities for summarising pages and automating tasks.As Opera’s EVP Krystian Kolondra told Fortune, “browsers today are the operating system of your applications.” In this view, the browser becomes the centre of productivity, not just navigation.Opera sees the browser as the primary AI gateway—a perspective shared by most companies in this new race.People spend hours a day inside their browser. Emails, documents, search queries, shopping, video calls—much of this occurs in the browser window itself. For AI companies, controlling this space means controlling the flow of attention, data, and transactions. Perplexity’s chief business officer told Fortune, “The browser is an incredibly powerful canvas.”The browser has become the new battleground because it now functions as the central gateway to a user’s digital life, rather than just a tool for viewing webpages. Most daily online activity—searching, reading, shopping, working, and even accessing enterprise applications—still happens inside a browser window. As Fortune points out, companies see the browser as the “operating system of your applications,” giving whoever controls it unparalleled visibility into user behaviour and preferences.AI accelerates this shift. Instead of simply loading websites, modern browsers are expected to interpret content, take actions on behalf of users, and coordinate tasks across email, calendars, documents, and messaging tools. This makes the browser the natural home for autonomous AI agents, which need consistent access to context and continuous interaction with a user’s digital environment. For tech companies competing in AI, owning the browser is strategically valuable because it offers a unified interface through which both humans and AI systems can work side by side.While companies like OpenAI draw significant attention, Forbes argues that Google is quietly winning the AI browser war through strategy, infrastructure, and scale. Chrome remains Google’s strongest asset, with an estimated user base of more than 3 billion people worldwide. This gives Google a level of reach that no competitor can match, and it also means any new browser is attempting to disrupt a behaviour pattern that has been built over more than a decade. Users rarely change their default browser, and Chrome’s long-term dominance makes switching even less likely.Google has also embedded its Gemini AI directly into products that people already rely on daily. This includes Chrome, Search, Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and Android. By integrating AI inside existing workflows rather than requiring users to download a new tool, Google can distribute new capabilities instantly to billions of people. The result is a low-friction adoption model that competitors such as OpenAI, Perplexity, and Opera do not possess.In addition to its consumer-facing advantages, Google also plays a central role in the wider AI ecosystem. As Forbes notes, Google Cloud is the preferred infrastructure provider for many AI startups, and the company is reportedly in talks with Anthropic for a large-scale cloud and AI chip partnership. This means Google not only controls the environment where users browse, but also the backend infrastructure that other AI companies require to operate.Together, these factors give Google a structural edge that shapes the competitive landscape long before new AI browsers reach the market.AI browsers introduce new privacy challenges. Unlike traditional search engines that only see queries, AI agents embedded inside the browser can access entire pages, user actions, scroll patterns, and intentions. As UCL’s George Chalhoub told Fortune: “An AI-powered browser doesn’t just observe your behaviour; it can infer your intentions, habits, and even your mood.”This expands both capability and risk.AI agents operating inside email, chats, and documents could expose:Even Sam Altman recently warned users that ChatGPT conversations are not legally protected from subpoenas. Opera, in response, has emphasised strong encryption and limited processing, but broader industry standards are still emerging.Despite hype about “browser disruption,” almost every AI browser remains tied to Chromium. Fortune explains that building a browser engine from scratch requires enormous investment and maintenance. Even Microsoft abandoned its proprietary engine, EdgeHTML, to adopt Chromium.This means:As Chalhoub says, “I don’t see any company building its browser from scratch.” This reality ensures Google remains central to the ecosystem—even for its challengers.While AI browsers offer advanced features, they face the biggest long-term barrier: user habits. People have been browsing the web the same way for 30 years—typing URLs, clicking links, navigating pages.Chalhoub notes that browsers are “stable and predictable,” creating deep user trust. But small conveniences—automatic trip planning, task completion, summarised reading—could gradually shift behaviour.The question is whether these enhancements are enough to convince mainstream users to switch.The AI browser race is only beginning, but the competitive landscape is already taking shape. OpenAI, Perplexity, and Opera are pushing new models of browsing that rely on autonomous agents, task automation, and tightly integrated AI features. These products represent a shift from the browser as a passive navigation tool to one that actively interprets and performs actions on behalf of the user.Google, meanwhile, is approaching the shift from a position of structural strength by embedding Gemini across Chrome, Search, Android, and its productivity tools. AI simply becomes part of the environment they already use. Its control over Chromium and its influence across cloud infrastructure further reinforce that advantage.The next phase of competition will depend on whether users embrace a fundamentally different browsing experience or whether AI-enhanced versions of familiar tools remain the dominant model. Behavioural change in technology is slow, but convenience can accelerate adoption, especially if AI agents begin saving time or completing complex tasks reliably.What is clear is that the browser is no longer just a window to the web. It is becoming the primary interface where human intent, AI reasoning, and the modern internet intersect. As companies race to define what that interface should look like, the outcome of the AI browser war will likely determine how billions of people interact with information for years to come.","Google Chrome has become the dominant gateway to the internet, holding more than 60% global market share.

Shark Tank India Judge Anupam Mittal on why AI won’t replace humans anytime soon: ‘The brain runs on 20 watts’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/shark-tank-india-judge-anupam-mittal-on-why-ai-wont-replace-humans-anytime-soon-the-brain-runs-on-20-watts/articleshow/126068827.cms,"Read Anupam Mittal’s complete post here



‘Is AI about to replace humans?’

Short answer: Not anytime soon

To match a single human brain using today’s AI approaches, you’d need something close to a football-field-sized data centre running flat out - just to mimic how one person sees, thinks, learns, and decides in real time.

All that to replicate what your brain does on 20 watts.

If you go further and try to replicate the brain 𝘣𝘪𝘰𝘭𝘰𝘨𝘪𝘤𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺- neurons, synapses, chemistry, plasticity - you’re no longer talking about a data center.

Theoretically, it can be done but you need a computer the size of planet Earth 🌍

That’s the gap people forget 🤷

AI is exceptional at automation, repetition, and pattern extraction at scale.

But judgment, creativity, context, taste, and knowing when 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘵𝘰 𝘢𝘤𝘵 aren’t just more parameters.

They’ve evolved over millions of years & are emergent properties of a system that learns continuously, reasons across domains, and compresses reality with extreme efficiency.

Until we see a fundamental shift in how intelligence is computed - not just bigger models and more GPUs - replacing human creativity isn’t a near-term threat.

The real miracle of the brain isn’t intelligence.

It’s all the complexity that fits inside your skull, runs on sugar and oxygen, and dissipates less heat than a light bulb.

That’s the human flex AI can’t replicate 😅





Shark Tank India judge and Shaadi.com founder Anupam Mittal has now shared his opinion on the ongoing debate of whether AI will replace human or not. Mittal argues that the technology is still far from replicating the complexity of the human bran. In a widely shared post titled “Is AI about to replace humans?”, Mittal offered a short answer: “Not anytime soon.” In a lengthy post shared on professional networking platform LinkedIn, Mittal explained that to match a single human brain using today’s AI approaches, one would need a football-field-sized data center running at full capacity—just to mimic how one person sees, thinks, learns, and decides in real time. He emphasised that by contrast the human brain performs all these tasks on just 20 watts of energy which is less than that of a household light bulb.Mittal also noted that replicating the human brain biologically neurons, synapses, chemistry, and plasticity would actually need a computer the size of planet Earth. “That’s the gap people forget,” he wrote. Mittal does acknowledge the fact that AI is exceptional at the tasks like automation, repetition and pattern extraction at scale but believes that qualities like creativity, judgement, context, resistant and taster are not the parameters to compute.“These have evolved over millions of years and are emergent properties of a system that learns continuously, reasons across domains, and compresses reality with extreme efficiency,” he said.As per Mittal, replacing the human creativity would require a fundamental shift in how intelligence is computed, not just bigger models and more GPUs. Until then, he believes AI will remain a powerful tool but not a substitute for human ingenuity. “The real miracle of the brain isn’t intelligence,” he concluded. “It’s all the complexity that fits inside your skull, runs on sugar and oxygen, and dissipates less heat than a light bulb.

Mustafa Suleyman’s AI system warning





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.He warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.",Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ He also said that Copilot is “amazing for vision.

A 23-year-old Brooklyn man faces charges for stealing $15 million by pretending to be a customer support worker for the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange. Ronald Spektor allegedly tricked around 100 people across the US into giving up their account passwords by reportedly telling them that their funds were in danger. US prosecutors have described the operation as a long-term theft scheme that ran from April 2023 until Spektor's arrest earlier this month.According to a Business Insider (BI) report, Spektor is currently being held at Rikers Island, with bail set at $500,000 cash. The charges against him include grand larceny and money laundering, which could result in a prison sentence of up to 25 years.Apart from theft and laundering charges, Spektor is accused of possessing stolen property and the private information of his victims. The legal case follows a criminal complaint detailing how he used his fake identity to gain access to the victims' digital assets over the course of nearly two years.In a statement to BI, Spektor’s attorney, Todd Spodek, said:As per the complaint, investigators from the NYPD and the Kings County District Attorney’s Office interviewed about 70 victims.In the complaint, prosecutors alleged:the complaint added, using the termto describe apps that store cryptocurrency to claim.The victims, thinking they were speakingthen provided Spektor with their seed phrases, which are sequences of 12 to 24 words that function like passwords, and transferred their cryptocurrency to wallets under Spektor's control, the complaint states.the complaint states.

Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis shares his 'longest standing passion' and how it can solve world's 'robotics problem',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-deepmind-ceo-demis-hassabis-shares-his-longest-standing-passion-and-how-it-can-solve-worlds-robotics-problem/articleshow/126060266.cms,"Demis Hassabis notes LLMs have limits







Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis recently shared his long-standing passion: World models and simulations. While the AI industry largely remains fixated on developing Large Language Models (LLMs), Hassabis is looking toward a different system to advance AI technology. Hassabis argues that while AI has mastered human language, it still lacks the “intuitive physics” required to function effectively in the physical world – something that is necessary for robotics to thrive.Speaking at an interview, Hassabis noted that language models like Gemini or GPT have exceeded expectations in their understanding of the world, proving that human language is far richer than even linguists imagined. However, he pointed out a fundamental gap: the physical world cannot be fully described in words.“There's still a lot about the spatial dynamics of the world, spatial awareness, and the physical context we're in – and how that works mechanically – that is hard to describe in words,” Hassabis explained.He cited sensory experiences such as motor angles, smell and the subtle mechanics of movement as elements that are nearly impossible to capture in a text data, pushing for beyond reading and start “experiencing.”“One way to show how do you test you have that kind of understanding? Well, can you generate realistic worlds? Because if you can generate it, then in a sense, the system must have encapsulated a lot of the mechanics of the world,” he said.Recently, Rodney Brooks, the roboticist who co-founded iRobot also said that current AI technology faces a biological barrier and for robotics to succeed as envisioned by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, robots must replicate human function, like mastering the complexity of human touch.He said that while today’s AI has mastered speech recognition and image processing due to vast available datasets, sensing touch cannot be learnt through these datasets.“We do not have such a tradition for touch data. Today's humanoid robots will not learn how to be dexterous despite the hundreds of millions, or perhaps many billions of dollars, being donated by VCs and major tech companies to pay for their training,"" Brooks said in a blog post.","Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis says AI lacks the physics required to function effectively in the physical world.
