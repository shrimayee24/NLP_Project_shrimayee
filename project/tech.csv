How Connor McDavid’s supercars reflect his precision, speed, and personality

Connor McDavid's Lifestyle IS NOT What You Think

Why Porsche 911 GT2 RS stands as Connor McDavid’s favorite ride

Connor McDavid's car collection, the mere mention of it can open up a whole new world for auto enthusiasts. You can't help but be intrigued when a skater known for his astonishing quickness owns the most luxurious cars in the world. The behind-the-wheel world of McDavid has become almost as exciting as that of the ice, and the constant whispers, snapshots, and news stories are all part of a garage scenario that is perfectly built for both thrill and precision lovers.He is fond of speedy, sharp design and machines that attract everybody's attention without even trying. Just think of it—impressive engines, elegantly shaped bodies, and brands that are synonymous with power.

Although the atmosphere of each vehicle is different, together they tell the tale of a sportsman who has passions for engineering as much as for hockey.McDavid's collection can be characterized by the harmony of diversity and spiritedness. The pure drama of his Lamborghini Huracán—chouette, loud, and ready to totally erase the road—adds personality to his garage.The Audi R8, with its V10 elegance and grace, may be cold but still very precise, could be wrangling. For a choice of luxury SUVs, he prefers the Range Rover Vogue, which can offer him maximum class and comfort combined with very light capability.The Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 is McDavid's car that radiates sounds; however, it's the American muscle car that provides supercharged vigor and finely-tuned road presence. Then there is the Ford F-150 Raptor, the beast that proves McDavid is not afraid of getting dirty off the road. The Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG, on the other hand, is the one that adds drama to the collection; its characteristic gullwing doors and powerful V8 engine are visually striking and lend the impression of being almost a character in the collection.Out of all the cars in his collection, the Porsche 911 GT2 RS is undoubtedly Connor McDavid’s favorite, according to several sources—the absolute choice for those who want nothing but the best in performance. Thanks to its track-oriented design, it has extremely precise control, and it produces massive power—basically a machine for sportspeople who love speed not only as a mere idea but as a way of life. For McDavid, the GT2 RS is not just a car—it’s part of the force he applies on the ice.Connor McDavid’s car collection is an exhibition of his/ flamboyance and substance—an automotive representation of his personality. The collection is made up of various cars that all demonstrate different facets of his style, resulting in a fleet that narrates its own high-speed tale of victory, love, and accuracy.Also Read: Why was Max Domi left out vs. the Washington Capitals, and will he get another chance this weekend?","Connor McDavid's car collection is an exhibition of his/ flamboyance and substance.

Alex Rodriguez’s girlfriend Jaclyn Cordeiro turns a quiet Instagram post into a confident style moment fans could not ignore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/alex-rodriguezs-girlfriend-jaclyn-cordeiro-turns-a-quiet-instagram-post-into-a-confident-style-moment-fans-could-not-ignore/articleshow/125969916.cms,"Alex Rodriguez and Jaclyn Cordeiro (Image credit: Kevork Djansezian/Getty)

Jaclyn Cordeiro Instagram post highlights evolving style and business alignment



Jaclyn Cordeiro did not explain herself on her latest Instagram Story. She did not add context or commentary. Instead, she shared two Instagram Stories that spoke through posture, framing, and restraint. The images were calm, intentional, and precise, drawing attention without asking for it. In a space often crowded with loud promotions, the simplicity stood out.The timing mattered. Alex Rodriguez continues to expand his presence beyond baseball, building credibility in business and lifestyle spaces. Cordeiro’s appearance fit neatly into that shift. What looked like a personal style post carried a sense of alignment and purpose. It was not performance driven. It was confident, measured, and quietly effective.In the first story, Cordeiro appeared in a close portrait shot wearing a white buttoned shirt. The black frames anchored the look, paired with a gold watch and stud earrings. Nothing felt overdone. The focus stayed on clean lines and balance, suggesting confidence rather than display. The image felt composed, not curated for attention.The second story offered a different tone. Reclined slightly on a couch, Cordeiro wore a deep-neck black blazer-style top. Her makeup remained minimal, reinforcing a relaxed but assured presence. The eyewear transitioned easily between the two looks, reflecting versatility without needing explanation. In both stories, she tagged the brand’s Instagram account, making the connection clear while keeping the moment understated.These posts connect to a partnership announced in late October involving Alex Rodriguez and a limited edition release of a best-selling eyewear frame. The collaboration reflects Rodriguez’s growing interest in products that balance everyday use with refined design. His approach remains consistent with how he has handled his post-playing career, choosing focus over flash.Rodriguez has explained what draws him to such ventures. “I've always looked for opportunities where great products meet strong leadership. LOOK OPTIC checks both boxes — high-quality, affordable, and stylish.” The quote reflects a practical mindset shaped by experience rather than trend chasing.He later reshared Cordeiro’s stories on his own Instagram, adding personal support to the rollout. The move felt natural, not promotional. It reinforced the idea that this moment was less about selling and more about alignment.Together, the posts created a subtle but effective narrative. Style met strategy without noise. Confidence replaced commentary. For fans watching closely, it was a reminder that influence does not always announce itself. Sometimes, it simply shows up and lets people notice.Also read: Kiké Hernández’s wife Mariana Vicente gives fans a warm glimpse into their life together with a quiet Instagram Story","Jaclyn Cordeiro shared two Instagram Stories that spoke through posture, framing, and restraint.

A pleasant and peaceful performance at Hangzhou Safari Park in East China’s Zhejiang Province on Saturday turned terrifying when a black bear suddenly attacked its keeper.Several videos are going viral on social media, showing audience members watching as two keepers guided two black bears onto the stage for another round of performance. One bear successfully performed, while the other, nearing the stage, pounced on its keeper and knocked him to the ground, Global News reported.The fallen keeper struggled to escape while nearby staff grabbed chairs and poles to separate the animal. After the bear was pulled away, it lunged at the keeper again, and staff had to use force to separate them.This footage prompted an online debate over whether animal performances should be banned. Other staff immediately intervened and used props to separate the bear from the keeper. Multiple social media users posted videos of the incident recorded during the bears’ show.The park explained that the incident occurred as the keeper was carrying a large bag of carrots and apples; the bear saw the bag, became excited, and pounced on the keeper in an attempt to get the food, according to the notice. The notice also stated that the keeper said the incident reminded him to be more careful in dealings with the bear in the future.The official social media account of Hangzhou Safari Park posted a notice on Saturday stating that neither the keeper nor the bear was injured.One user, Momo, on the China's social media platform commented, “Safety must be a priority, and we should have respect for animals. Never think of them as cute and docile, or that we can control them.”Another user, Zero Geqian Qianqian, also emphasised the need to focus on safety. Many others have called for the cancellation of animal performances. A user named “Don’t Call Me Ma Ma Ma” asked, “When will animal performances be canceled? Isn’t it in animals’ nature to be food-driven and protective of their food?”Some users expressed sympathy for the bear. A user named “The Girl is Out, I’m at Home” said, “A small bear is like a little baby. How could we make it perform? If it has apples, let it eat! If it were your child, would you make it perform first and then eat? If it’s hungry, then let it perform how to eat, it would be happier, the keeper and the bear would be more harmonious, and the audience would still enjoy it.”On the X also, several users commented on the video. One of the user said, ""I see why the Russians train with them 🤣🤣🤣 that bear is a professional grappler.""Another said, ""Maybe if we didn't lock these animals up for our own amusement they wouldn't attack people.""After the video of the bear attack went viral online and sparked debate, the park released a follow-up video showing that the bear and the keeper have since “reconciled.” While feeding the black bear carrots, the keeper gently petted its head and said, “If you want carrots, why did you snatch mine? [Even if you didn’t], I’ll still give you some.” The black bear stood calmly and ate peacefully, displaying a gentle demeanour.",A black bear suddenly attacked its keeper at Hangzhou Safari Park in East China's Zhejiang Province on Saturday.

Driving rules and fines

Reduce Speed: Motorists must slow down immediately. Wet roads significantly increase braking distance and the risk of aquaplaning (skidding). Driving in foggy weather without turning on vehicle lights can incur an AED 400 fine and four black points.

400 fine and four black points. Increase Distance: Maintain a sufficient safety gap. The standard three-second rule should be increased to a minimum of five seconds between your vehicle and the one ahead.

Use Proper Lighting: Turn on low-beam headlights and use fog lights when visibility drops. Never use high beams, as the light reflects off the water droplets or fog, reducing visibility for everyone.

Check Your Car: Before setting out, verify that your tires, brakes, and headlights are working properly. Crucially, ensure your windshield wipers are functional and the washer fluid tank is full.

Stay Focused: Maintain full attention on the road at all times.Taking photos or filming the rain while driving is a serious violation resulting in an AED 800 fine and four black points.

Mandatory water safety

Avoid Flood Zones: Residents must stay clear of valleys (Wadis), water channels, and any areas prone to flash floods. The depth and force of moving water are often misjudged; it can take less than 12 inches of rapidly moving water to sweep a car away. AED 1,000 fine and six black points for gathering near valleys and flood zones.



Do Not Go Near the Sea: The public is strongly advised to avoid beaches and to refrain from any sailing or marine activities. Rough seas and strong waves can pose severe threats to even experienced sea-goers. Driving into a closed road or flooded valley, ignoring the instructions of the competent authority, results in an AED 2,000 fine, 23 black points, and 60 days of vehicle impoundment.



Marine Vessels: Owners and operators of boats, ships, and yachts are urged to closely monitor the latest weather forecasts and strictly comply with all issued navigation and safety instructions before considering setting sail.





On the evening of Saturday, 13 December 2025, the Dubai Police General Command issued a public safety alert to everyone in the emirate. The message, sent directly to mobile phones and shared across media, warned that unstable and rainy weather was expected, and urged residents to stay alert and take precautions.This alert comes amid unsettled weather across the UAE, forecast by the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) to include rain, thunderstorms, strong winds, and cooler temperatures over the coming days.Authorities have confirmed their full preparedness to manage any emergency, including responding to traffic incidents or situations in mountainous terrain and valleys. Residents are called upon to drive with extreme care and follow official guidance as the situation evolves.For immediate assistance during the weather event, the police have designated two critical contact lines:Unstable weather, be it heavy rain, low visibility, or sudden dust storms, significantly increases the risk of accidents on the road. The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) and Dubai Police have issued specific, non-negotiable guidelines for motorists:Must-follow driving checklist:The greatest immediate danger during periods of intense rainfall is the risk of sudden flash flooding and strong marine currents.Official warnings strictly prohibit any travel into low-lying, water-prone areas.While authorities like the Dubai Police and the RTA are fully prepared to manage emergencies, the most effective defense against adverse weather begins with you. By internalizing these simple, crucial safety measures, slowing down, avoiding valleys, and staying informed, you not only protect yourself and your loved ones but also help keep emergency services free to assist those in critical need.","Dubai Police General Command issued a public safety alert to everyone in the emirate.

Khaleej Times





A new scam has surfaced in Dubai’s parking areas, where scammers are placing fake QR codes on parking signages to trick drivers into making payments through fraudulent links. These counterfeit codes can capture personal and banking information, exposing motorists to financial risk.The issue gained attention after a video showing QR code tampering went viral online. Parkin Company PJSC, Dubai’s largest provider of paid parking facilities, confirmed it is aware of the incident. In a statement shared with, the company said all identified fraudulent QR codes have been removed. It also said that any QR codes that were misused have been updated to redirect users to the official Roads and Transport Authority website.Scammers typically place fake stickers over legitimate QR codes on parking signboards, making the tampering difficult to detect at first glance. All parking signages across Dubai feature QR codes that allow motorists to pay parking fees quickly and conveniently. Drivers who choose mobile or mParking services save 30 fils compared to paying via SMS. When scanned correctly, the QR code activates an App Clips feature linked to the Parkin App, allowing users to pay instantly using the bank card stored on their mobile device without downloading a separate application.Parkin has urged motorists to always use authorised payment channels and thanked the public for reporting suspicious activity. The company warned that fake QR codes can steal sensitive information, including personal and bank details, and advised drivers to rely on official platforms such as the RTA app or Parkin when making parking payments.","Scammers are placing fake QR codes on parking signages to trick drivers into making payments through fraudulent links.

UAE introduces new law to protect children without known parents,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-introduces-new-law-to-protect-children-without-known-parents/articleshow/125947580.cms,"Federal law in UAE ensures care and rights for parentless children / AI Generated Image

What the new law does for child rights?

Prioritizes “the best interests of the child” in care, custody, and upbringing decisions.

Creates an integrated care system that coordinates social, health, educational and psychological support for each child.

Protects children’s identity and privacy, helping them integrate positively into society, grow with dignity, and avoid stigma associated with their origins.

Child protection in the UAE

Ensuring access to essential services and opportunities regardless of a child’s parental status.

Standardizing care protocols so authorities and caregivers follow a unified, child-first approach across the nation.

Promoting integration into society, helping children grow with dignity, identity and opportunities equal to other residents.

UAE and ongoing initiatives





The UAE Government has issued Federal Decree-Law No. (12) of 2025, a major legal reform focused on children of unknown parentage, that is, children whose biological parents are not legally identified or known. This law strengthens how the country cares for vulnerable children and ensures they grow up in safe, stable environments.The decree is part of the UAE’s ongoing efforts to update its child welfare framework following decades of legislative activity, including the existing Child Rights Law (formerly known as Wadeema’s Law).The new law reframes how children without known parents are cared for and supported. It does the following:Under the reform, all important decisions involving these children must fully reflect their physical, emotional, and social needs, including access to education, healthcare, and a secure family environment.This law builds on the existing Child Rights Law (Federal Law No. 3 of 2016), which already guarantees a broad set of protections for all children in the UAE, including protection from neglect, abuse, exploitation and discrimination.Children with unknown parentage often face complex legal and social challenges, such as lack of documentation, unclear affiliation, and difficulty accessing services. The new law aims to remove these barriers by:Experts welcomed the move as a logical continuation of the UAE’s child welfare strategy, which prioritizes safety, health, education and emotional development for all children, from newborns to teenagers.The new law aligns with other efforts in the UAE to strengthen child rights and safety. The Child Rights Law (Wadeema’s Law) already protects children against abuse, neglect, and psychological harm, and places priority on family and safe environments for children.Local forums and initiatives, such as the Child Safety Forum in Sharjah, bring authorities and experts together to promote best practices in child protection. Updated personal status and family laws in the UAE have also placed children’s welfare at the heart of legal reforms, including custody, support and identity issues.These developments show the UAE is working on multiple fronts to create a comprehensive child protection ecosystem, not just for children with known families but also for the most vulnerable who lack parental identity.The UAE’s Federal Decree-Law No. (12) of 2025 marks a significant step in modernizing and strengthening child protection laws. By focusing on the best interests of children with unknown parents, and ensuring stable care, rights, and opportunity, the country reinforces its long-standing commitment to children’s welfare and social inclusion.","The UAE Government has issued Federal Decree-Law No. (12) of 2025, a major legal reform focused on children of unknown parentage.

Why the work is happening?

Alternative roads and diversion

Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road (E311): This is the main parallel highway to Emirates Road. Motorists can transition to the E311 earlier in their journey, as it offers a vast network of interchanges that connect directly to areas like Al Barari, Dubai Investment Park (DIP), and ultimately the Jebel Ali area.

(E311): This is the main parallel highway to Emirates Road. Motorists can transition to the E311 earlier in their journey, as it offers a vast network of interchanges that connect directly to areas like Al Barari, Dubai Investment Park (DIP), and ultimately the Jebel Ali area. Sheikh Zayed Road (E11): While a much busier and more central route, the E11 runs closer to the coast and is often used as a long-distance alternative, particularly for those heading toward Jebel Ali Port or Abu Dhabi.

Dubai–Al Ain Road (E66): For traffic approaching the E611 from the eastern side of Dubai, the E66 serves as a critical connector. If the specific exit loops at the E611/Lehbab intersection are closed, drivers are advised to continue on the E66 and utilize the next available exit or interchange to double back or access local roads.

Al Yalayes Road (D57): This road is a high-capacity link, especially vital for commercial traffic moving from Jebel Ali Port and the surrounding Free Zone. It can be used to connect traffic between the Sheikh Zayed Road (E11) and the Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road (E311), effectively bypassing the core E611 work zone.





From Thursday, 11 December 2025, authorities will temporarily close the slip-road at Bridge No. 7 on Emirates Road for vehicles travelling from Ras Al Khaimah towards Al Dhaid. Motorists affected by the closure are being asked to use nearby alternatives such as Bridge No. 6 and the recently opened Khorfakkan Road Tunnel while the work is under way. The closure and diversion were publicly announced as part of traffic advisories issued on December 10.The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in Dubai issued a traffic alert announcing the immediate closure of a critical stretch on Emirates Road (E611). The closure specifically targeted the slip road used by northbound traffic heading towards the important Jebel Ali–Lehbab Road/Al Qudra Road junction.The work began on December 11, 2025, and was deemed essential to facilitate the complex construction required for a major upgrade project. Commuters traveling north on E611 who needed to exit at this point were immediately impacted and directed to use the newly implemented diversion routes signaled by the RTA.This closure is part of wider, phased improvements to the Emirates Road (E611) corridor designed to boost capacity and safety on one of the UAE’s main arterial routes.The stretch has been targeted for lane and interchange upgrades in a larger Dh750 million expansion plan launched earlier in 2025 that aims to increase lane capacity on key segments, shorten commute times and ease congestion for drivers travelling between Ras Al Khaimah, Umm Al Quwain, Sharjah and Dubai.That expansion includes widening lanes and upgrading interchange No. 7 with multiple new bridges, work planned to increase throughput and cut travel times sharply for long-distance commuters.For commuters whose primary route involves the E611 and requires an exit into the southern or western Dubai areas, several major arterial roads serve as primary alternatives, depending on the traveler's starting point:These detours were strategically planned to reroute vehicles around the construction zone, maintaining access to the critical roads which link key economic and residential districts, thus minimizing long-term disruption. This vital junction connects the major Emirates Road (E611) with the Jebel Ali-Lehbab Road and Al Qudra Road, making its smooth operation essential for the entire southern corridor of Dubai.",The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in Dubai issued a traffic alert announcing the immediate closure of a critical stretch on Emirates Road (E611) The closure specifically targeted the slip road used by northbound traffic heading towards the important Jebel Ali–Lehbab Road/Al Qudra Road junction.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125889079,imgsize-37730,width-400,resizemode-4/dubai-traffic.jpg"

Day 1 Abu Dhabi’s Bridge Summit

Idris Elba empowering Africa

$2.8 trillion revolution

‘Leapfrog’ advantage





Abu Dhabi’s BRIDGE Summit opened today (Dec 8, 2025), bringing together creators, platforms, investors and stars to map how AI, creators and global storytelling will reshape media. The three-day event mixes headliner keynotes, hands-on sessions and dealmaking, and the tone is unapologetically ambitious.The Bridge Summit 2025 officially kicked off today at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC), immediately setting a bold tone for the future of global media. Running for three days, the event has attracted a massive convergence of over 60,000 creatives, media specialists, artists, investors, and entrepreneurs.The scale is truly global, with more than 400 speakers, including policymakers and innovation leaders, and attendees from 182 countries.Organizers emphasized that the summit is designed to be the global industry’s new home, a dedicated space for forging high-value partnerships, developing production ecosystems, and exchanging expertise. As stated in the evocative opening film, the message is clear: ""Abu Dhabi is not looking toward the future; it is building it.""A major highlight was the panel featuring Hollywood superstar Idris Elba, who stated he views his own identity as a ""bridge"" between his heritage, the stories he tells, and global audiences. His core mission is to empower African creators and rewrite the continent's global narrative, which has long suffered from misrepresentation.Elba identified a critical issue: many African creators who achieve viral success are blocked from receiving earnings by banking restrictions and digital barriers. To solve this practical problem, he created Akunna (named after his middle name), a platform centered around the Akunna Wallet designed to ensure creators can actually be paid for their work.The opening sessions underscored the sheer economic power of the sector, noting that global media and entertainment generated over $2.8 trillion last year. The line between traditional creative fields is rapidly blurring; today, musicians are becoming developers, and filmmakers are building immersive digital worlds. Key discussions centered on technology, revealing that nearly 70% of content creators are already utilizing AI tools in their work.Speakers explored AI's promise for efficiency and scaling creativity, but also highlighted the associated risks to integrity, authorship, and truth. The consensus was that while AI is a powerful tool, the priority must be establishing frameworks to guide its ethical use and rebuild trust in an age of deepfakes and misinformation.Elba stressed that Africa has a unique advantage: the ability to ""leapfrog"" old infrastructure and build entirely new creative systems, citing the global success of Afrobeats as powerful proof. He argued that the potential for African gaming and fantasy is immense because it operates on a ""blank canvas.""However, he sharply criticized the lack of governmental support, pointing out that some African nations still do not have a dedicated film policy. His message to policymakers was direct: if you want a healthy creative ecosystem, you need infrastructure, distribution, and protection, not just conversation.He concluded that while AI is not the enemy, ""actual intelligence is more powerful than artificial intelligence,"" and requires strong frameworks to maintain authentic human creativity.Beyond panels, BRIDGE is a marketplace: organisers expect the summit to catalyse MoUs, studio deals and investment into production hubs and creative platforms. Abu Dhabi’s push to host the event signals a strategic shift, the emirate wants to be a media-tech crossroads that connects capital, talent and festivals.","The Bridge Summit 2025 officially kicked off today at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC) The event has attracted a massive convergence of over 60,000 creatives, media specialists, artists, investors, and entrepreneurs.

Madinah’s Taibah University action

Why this happened?

Advice for students and staff

What is Blackboard?





The academic routine at Taibah University in Madinah, Saudi Arabia , saw a sudden, mandatory shift this week, prioritizing the safety of its community over traditional classroom attendance. Taibah’s notice cites National Center of Meteorology reports as the reason for the suspension; students were directed to Blackboard for remote study instructions. The university announced the suspension of all in-person classes across its extensive network of campuses, immediately transitioning to a fully digital learning environment.The suspension of physical attendance applied comprehensively to the university’s main campus in Madinah and all of its subsidiary branches located throughout the wider Madinah region. This decision was specifically implemented for Monday, December 8, 2025. To ensure educational continuity without delay, all scheduled lessons and lectures were immediately converted to a distance learning format.The university confirmed that instruction would be conducted entirely through the established Blackboard system. This switch demonstrated the institution’s prepared infrastructure for managing disruptive events while upholding academic obligations.The critical reason behind the rapid change was a severe weather warning issued by the national meteorological body. The university’s announcement, reported by Al-Riaydh newspaper, was made following official reports from the National Center of Meteorology (NCM).These reports indicated the high probability of heavy rainfall across the area, posing a significant risk to commuters and campus safety. The primary motivation for the suspension, confirmed by university officials, was the deep concern for the safety of both students and administrative staff and faculty. The university affirmed that this pre-emptive step was taken in coordination with all relevant specialized authorities tasked with managing regional weather crises.Students and faculty should: (1) log into Blackboard before scheduled class times to confirm session links and any revised assessment arrangements; (2) follow Taibah University’s official social channels and the university portal for real-time notices; and (3) avoid travel to campus while alerts are active. The university’s message stresses that classes remain in session remotely, so attendance and coursework expectations continue as normal unless otherwise announced.Blackboard is Taibah University’s official online learning platform used to deliver classes, assignments, exams and course materials remotely. When in-person classes are suspended, Blackboard becomes the main way for students and teachers to continue lessons without interruption.Students can access Blackboard through the university portal or the mobile app. After logging in with their university ID, they can open each course page to find live class links, lecture recordings, assignments and announcements. Teachers may also upload new schedules or send messages about any changes. Students should keep notifications enabled and check their course dashboards regularly, especially during weather-related closures.The decision by Taibah University reflects a broader pattern of instability in the region's weather conditions. Contextual reports, including the Saudi Gazette, confirmed that the NCM had warned of a widespread rainy spell commencing around this time, affecting not only Madinah but also neighboring regions like the Makkah highlands.","Taibah University in Madinah, Saudi Arabia, suspended all in-person classes this week.

"Why robotics pioneer, the Roomba co-creator, is skeptical about his field",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-robotics-pioneer-the-roomba-co-creator-is-skeptical-about-his-field/articleshow/125956719.cms,"



In the 1980s, limitations on computing constrained robot development. Watching insects, pioneering roboticist Rodney Brooks realised that they possessed little brainpower but were far more capable than his robots, and that mimicking animal biology was smarter than trying to control every aspect of a robot’s behaviour through code. His successes led him to predict robots “everywhere in our world.”At 70, the former MIT lab director and a co-creator of the popular Roomba robot vacuum lives in that world. But Brooks, who has spent his career making intelligent machines a part of everyday life, finds himself playing the skeptic.Today’s entrepreneurs promise robots that not only look human — or human-ish — but can also do everything a person can. Tech investors are pouring billions into the effort, but Brooks argues that general-purpose humanoid robots will not be coming home soon, and that they are not safe enough to be around humans.In Sept, he delivered a takedown in an essay that concluded that over the next 15 years, “a lot of money will have disappeared, spent on trying to squeeze performance, any performance, from today’s humanoid robots. But those robots will be long gone and mostly conveniently forgotten.”His blog post kicked off a furore in the small world of robotics. This was a legend in the field, whose insights had informed the humanoid craze.“At least a dozen people asked me if I agreed with it shortly after it went live (I don’t),” wrote Chris Paxton, a researcher in AI and robotics.Brooks remembers German technologist Ernst Dickmanns’ self-driving car, which began motoring across Europe in 1987. He was around when IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer defeated chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997, and when AI researcher Geoff Hinton predicted in 2016 that radiology would be obsolete in five years because machine learning software could do it better. All of these were important developments, but drivers, chess players and radiologists are still among us.Brooks insists he is simply being practical. “We’re going to go through a big hype, and then there’s going to be a trough of disappointment,” he said in an interview.The physical appearance of a robot, Brooks likes to say, makes a promise about what it can do. Robots in wide use today are designed for specific jobs in specific situations, and look like it — an arm that does the same repetitive action on a manufacturing line, or the automated pallet movers in Amazon warehouses. They aren’t flashy. “People see the humanoid form,” he said, “and they think it’s going to be able to do everything a human can. ”Brooks said he wouldn’t get within three feet of a humanoid bot. If — when, he says — they lose balance, the powerful mechanics that make them useful make them dangerous.The current humanoid craze is “kind of his fault,” said Anthony Jules, Brooks’ co-founder and CEO at Robust.AI, which is building automated carts for distribution centres. Jules was an MIT undergrad in the 1990s when Brooks was leading the school’s Computer Science and AI Laboratory — helping create the algorithms behind today’s autonomous cars, pioneering the feedback loops that link AI and robotics.Brooks, who grew up in Australia, arrived at Adelaide’s Flinders University in 1972 at the same time as academic refugees fleeing the end of the Prague Spring, allowing him to receive a “classical Eastern European mathematics education.” He spent 12 hours each Sunday futzing around with the university’s only mainframe computer. He cofounded his first AI startup in 1984 while teaching at Stanford.Brooks is particularly skeptical that neural networks are ready to solve the dexterity problem. Humans don’t have a language for gathering, storing and communicating data about touch. In his view, the visual data preferred by the new guard of robot startups simply won’t be able to re-create what we can do with our fingers.“My students have built lots of hands, my students have built lots of arms, shipped tens of thousands of robot arms,” Brooks said. “I’m very convinced that humanoid robots are not going to have human-level manipulation.”Brooks would say he is a realist, not a pessimist. His main worry is that too much focus on the trendiest training techniques will leave other promising ideas neglected. He expects that robots will someday work alongside people, and that we may even refer to them as humanoid — but they will be on wheels, he says, and have multiple arms and probably won’t be general purpose.He works above the mock-up warehouse in San Carlos, California, where Robust’s robots learn their trade, but he expects to retire in the next few years. Then, Brooks plan to write a book about the nature of intelligence, and why humans won’t create it artificially for another 300 years.","Former MIT lab director and a co-creator of the popular Roomba robot vacuum lives in that world. But Brooks, who has spent his career making intelligent machines a part of everyday life, finds himself playing the skeptic. In Sept, he delivered a takedown in an essay that concluded that over the next 15 years, ‘a lot of money will have disappeared’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125954354,imgsize-20048,width-400,resizemode-4/why-robotics-pioneer-the-roomba-co-creator-is-skeptical-about-his-field.jpg"
‘Imagine the smell’: Why Cline AI head’s anti-India comment was neither a joke nor neutral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/imagine-the-smell-why-cline-ai-heads-anti-india-comment-was-neither-a-joke-nor-neutral/articleshow/125952352.cms,"

What actually happened

A phrase with a long and ugly history

Intent versus impact is not an equal debate

Corporate responses and unresolved questions

Why this was never just about a joke





When a single-line reply under a hackathon photo set off a storm on X, many outside the Indian and South Asian tech community initially dismissed the reaction as overblown. The phrase was short, vague and, to some, easily explained away as a crude joke about long hours and crowded rooms. But for many Indians in tech, the comment landed very differently. It touched a nerve shaped by years of stereotypes, coded insults and experiences that make certain words anything but neutral.The controversy began when a photograph from a high-profile hackathon was shared on X, showing a large crowd of developers and engineers. In response, Nik Pash, Cline’s head of AI, replied with the phrase “imagine the smell.” Almost immediately, Indian and South Asian users pointed out that the phrase is widely recognised online as a racist meme aimed at their community.As criticism mounted, Pash defended the remark as a harmless joke about hackathons and refused to apologise. “I’m not going to apologise for making a harmless joke about hackathons smelling bad,” he wrote, adding that he had attended several such events that year and that “they all smelled bad.”That stance intensified the backlash. Prominent voices in the tech ecosystem stepped in to explain publicly why the phrase carried racial meaning regardless of intent. Deedy Das, an Indian-origin tech investor, put it bluntly: “Every time I’ve seen ‘imagine the smell’, it’s an attack on Indians.” His point, echoed by many others, was not about reading malice into every joke, but about recognising how certain phrases function online.The discussion escalated rapidly, alongside legitimate criticism, there were also instances of harassment and threats, which many critics condemned outright. Only after sustained public pressure did Saoud Rizwan, the founder and chief executive of Cline, issue a statement. He distanced the company from the comment and acknowledged that harm had been caused, while emphasising that the remark was not intended to offend.The reaction was not driven by hypersensitivity to humour. “Imagine the smell” is widely recognised online as a racist meme used to mock Indians and South Asians, particularly in tech and gaming spaces. For years, the phrase has circulated alongside stereotypes about hygiene, food and overcrowding, often functioning as a way to demean Indian professionals while preserving plausible deniability.One of the most persistent tropes behind it is the idea that Indians “smell like curry”, a stereotype that has followed South Asians for decades across schools, workplaces and popular culture. From playground taunts to office jokes and anonymous comment sections, food, spices and bodies are collapsed into a single insult, implying uncleanliness and otherness. Indian media commentary has repeatedly traced this trope to colonial-era attitudes that used hygiene and bodily difference as tools of racial hierarchy.Online forums make clear how common the association remains. Indian and South Asian users frequently describe encountering comments such as “smells like curry” or “imagine the smell” under unrelated photos or videos, often accompanied by emoji reactions meant to signal mockery rather than humour. The phrasing survives precisely because it allows users to retreat behind irony or alleged ambiguity when challenged.Because of that history, intent becomes secondary. When language is repeatedly used to target a specific group, it carries meaning even when the speaker claims a different context. For many Indians, the words do not arrive as a blank slate. They arrive loaded.Defenders of the comment focused heavily on intent, arguing that because it was not meant to be racist, it should not be treated as such. But this framing misunderstands how harm operates. Impact is shaped by repetition, power and context, not by a single explanation offered after the fact.For Indians in tech, the impact is cumulative. It is built from schoolyard taunts, online slurs, workplace jokes and the constant pressure to laugh along to avoid being labelled humourless or difficult. Viewed through this lens, the comment did not exist in isolation. It fit a familiar pattern.Calling out the phrase was not about punishing an individual. It was about naming a problem that is often minimised or ignored. Several Indian voices made the same point publicly: even if the comment was not intended as anti-India, its effect was indistinguishable from comments that clearly are.Cline’s response reflected a familiar corporate dilemma. Companies often move quickly to manage reputational fallout, but rarely go far enough in confronting the cultural assumptions that make such incidents possible. For many Indian professionals, the lingering question is not whether a statement was issued, but whether genuine understanding followed.Will future humour be filtered through an awareness of historical harm, or will each episode be treated as an isolated misunderstanding?At its core, the controversy was not about policing humour or enforcing ideological conformity. It was about who gets to define harm. Indians in tech are frequently cited as evidence of diversity and meritocracy, yet their experiences are often discounted when they articulate discomfort.For many Indians, the phrase was never neutral because lived experience has taught them it rarely is. This does not mean every careless comment is malicious. It does mean that dismissing the reaction as oversensitivity ignores the way words accumulate meaning over time.The lesson from this episode is not that humour should vanish from tech culture. It is that context matters, history matters and listening matters. When those are ignored, even a few words can reveal far more than the speaker intended.","The controversy began when a photograph from a high-profile hackathon was shared on X, showing a large crowd of developers and engineers.

Social media vetting from December 15





As the State Department begins social media vetting of all visa applicants, primarily H-1B, H-4 but also students and other non-immigrant visas, immigration lawyer Brad Bernstein explained that now there is unlikely to be any instant visa approval and immigration officials will go through all social media profiles of a candidate -- looking for contradictions. If the social media profiles are locked, then there are chances that the visa request will be instantly canceled.Bernstein explained that immigration officials have been asked to check Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X, LinkedIn, Snapchat, but the scrutiny may not remain limited to these popular social media platforms. They may check any resume posted on the Internet, any blog in your name or a YouTube comment -- practically anything that comes up on the Internet on the applicant's name.The lawyer advised that applicants must fix any contradictions in their online profiles before the visa interview, after they make them public. They should also Google themselves to check what all comes up when their name is searched. ""They’re looking for inconsistencies, signs of immigrant intent that you may want to stay in the US looking for a Green Card, hostile statements about the United States, support for extremist groups, questionable work history, or signs that posts were deleted after filing,"" the lawyer said.""If your visa form says you are a full-time engineering student, but your LinkedIn shows freelance work or you are driving an Uber, now you have a credibility issue. You made a post somewhere or a comment: 'I can't wait to live in America forever', now you have an immigrant intent,"" Bernstein said, adding that applicants should not delete anything after filing as it would make things worse.Consular offices have been asked to go through the social media accounts of the visa applicants starting from December 15.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Google tests new Phone app feature that lets urgent calls bypass Do Not Disturb,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-tests-new-phone-app-feature-that-lets-urgent-calls-bypass-do-not-disturb/articleshow/125964471.cms,"How Phone by Google’s new feature works





Google announced a new feature for its Phone app earlier this month that will allow callers to surpass Do Not Disturb (DND). According to a report by 9to5Google, Phone by Google’s new “Expressive Calling” feature is beginning to roll out for beta users. Those who have enrolled in the beta can check the availability of the feature via:Phone Settings > General > Expressive Calling (near the bottom).As per the report, the high-level preference (“Enhance calling with visual and haptic feedback”) will be enabled by default. Google is allowing users to decide whether “Urgent call can interrupt Do Not Disturb” is on.According to the report, both parties must have Phone by Google beta (version 203) to get this to work at this stage. Once the feature is available, the calling screen will show a “Mark call as urgent?” card above the usual controls. Users can tap on “Notify.”When you make an urgent call, the person you’re calling will see an “It’s urgent!” alert on their screen along with a flashing siren emoji. If they don’t answer, the call will show an “urgent” tag in their call history.In a separate update, Phone by Google 202 has now moved to the stable release channel. However, features such as the shorter bottom bar and the new “Keep portrait mode” option are still not broadly available.

"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on why despite being the CEO of world's most-valuable company, sense of uncertainty and insecurity doesn't leave him",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-on-why-despite-being-the-ceo-of-worlds-most-valuable-company-sense-of-uncertainty-and-insecurity-doesnt-leave-him/articleshow/125883149.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, despite leading his company to a $5 trillion valuation, lives in constant anxiety, a fear rooted in a near-bankruptcy experience. Recent reports of Meta potentially buying Google's AI chips have caused a $250 billion market value drop, validating Huang's long-held belief that the company is always '30 days from going out of business'.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

A near-death experience that shaped Huang’s three decades of paranoia

Why Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang 's fears suddenly look prophetic





Despite leading Nvidia to become the first company ever to hit a $5 trillion valuation, CEO Jensen Huang admits he operates in constant anxiety, working every single day including holidays. His fears may be justified—this week alone, Nvidia lost $250 billion in market value after reports emerged that Meta is in advanced talks to buy billions worth of competing chips from Google , threatening the chipmaker's decade-long dominance in AI hardware.""The phrase '30 days from going out of business'—I've used for 33 years,"" Huang revealed on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. ""The feeling doesn't change. The sense of vulnerability, the sense of uncertainty, the sense of insecurity—it doesn't leave you.""Huang's anxiety isn't unfounded paranoia—it's scar tissue from survival. In the mid-1990s, Nvidia discovered fatal flaws in its first graphics chip while developing technology for Sega's gaming console. With funds evaporating, Huang flew to Japan for an excruciating conversation: he told Sega's CEO the product wouldn't work and the deal must end, but simultaneously begged for the final $5 million payment to prevent bankruptcy.Remarkably, Sega converted it into an investment, giving Nvidia the lifeline that eventually built a trillion-dollar empire.That near-collapse experience now fuels Huang's relentless schedule. He wakes at 4 a.m. daily to read ""several thousand emails,"" works seven days a week without exception—""including Thanksgiving, Christmas""—and admits he's ""always in a state of anxiety."" His motivation? ""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed. Failure drives me more than greed.""Huang's paranoia might be wisdom. Nvidia made the rare move of issuing a public defense after The Information reported that Meta—planning up to $72 billion in AI spending this year—is negotiating massive purchases of Google's tensor processing units (TPUs). The news triggered a 6% stock plunge, erasing roughly $250 billion in value, while Alphabet shares surged 4%.""Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry—it's the only platform that runs every AI model,"" the company declared on X, breaking its usual silence on competitors. But Google's latest Gemini 3 AI model, trained entirely on TPUs rather than Nvidia chips, is being hailed by industry leaders as potentially superior. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff publicly announced he's switching from ChatGPT after three years, calling Gemini 3 the better product.The threat is existential to Nvidia's 90% market share in AI accelerators. If Google captures even a fraction of the hundreds of billions being spent on AI processors—particularly from customers like Meta—it would represent the first serious crack in Nvidia's dominance.Huang's work ethic has infected his family: both his children, Madison and Spencer, now in their thirties, work at Nvidia after joining as interns in 2020 and 2022. ""Now we have three people working every day,"" Huang said.For a CEO who never stopped running scared despite building a $4.5-trillion empire, the market turmoil caused by Google likely only confirmed what he's believed for 33 years: you're always 30 days from going out of business.","Jensen Huang is the CEO of Nvidia, the first company ever to hit a $5 trillion valuation.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently hinted at building data centres in space. In an interview with Fox News, Pichai said that the company is working on quantum computing, adding “in that spirit, one of our moon shots is to, how do we one day have data centers in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun”.Sundar Pichai’s video from the interview was shared by X (formerly Twitter) user - Bourbon Capital in an online post. It caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk who replied to the post with a single word. “Interesting”, Musk wrote.“At Google, we are always proud of taking moon shots,” Pichai said, adding “... Waymo … has been over a decade in the making.”“We're working on quantum computing, in that spirit, one of our moon shots is to, how do we one day have data centers in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun,” he continued.Pichai further said that the company wants to “put these data centers in space closer to the sun”, and will take “first step in 2027”.“We'll send tiny racks of machines and have them in satellites, test them out, and then start scaling from there. But there's no doubt to me that a decade or so away will be viewing it as a more normal way to build data centers,” Sundar Pichai said in the interview.Notably, this echoes Musk's November 2025 announcements that SpaceX will pioneer orbital data centers using next-gen Starlink satellites, positioning them as the lowest-cost AI compute option within five years.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company is working on quantum computing.

How it may be end of what developers called 'Apple Tax' in the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-it-may-be-end-of-what-developers-called-apple-tax-in-the-us/articleshow/125962177.cms,"A federal appeals court has largely upheld a contempt finding against Apple, ruling the tech giant willfully violated an injunction by charging a 27% commission on external payment links. This move, deemed to have a ""prohibitive effect"" on competition, could significantly alter App Store fees. While Apple can charge reasonable security fees, the ""Apple Tax"" faces a major challenge.

Court says Apple's fees have 'prohibitive effect' on competition

Apple wins partial victory but faces uncertain future





A federal appeals court ruling could dramatically reshape how Apple charges fees on its App Store, potentially ending what developers have long criticized as the ""Apple Tax."" The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld a contempt finding against Apple on Thursday, determining the tech giant willfully violated a 2021 injunction by charging a 27% commission on purchases made through external payment links.The three-judge panel agreed Apple acted in bad faith by implementing restrictions that made external payments impractical for developers. The court found Apple's 27% fee on outside transactions had a ""prohibitive effect,"" and its design requirements—limiting links to plain text rather than buttons—made it difficult for customers to use alternative payment options.Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, whose company sparked the legal battle by intentionally breaking App Store rules in 2020, declared ""the Apple Tax is dead in the USA."" He suggested Apple should only charge minimal fees—potentially just ""tens or hundreds of dollars"" per app review—rather than percentage-based commissions on transactions.However, the appeals court partially sided with Apple on one key issue. While it struck down the 27% commission as excessive, judges ruled Apple can charge ""reasonable fees"" based on actual costs for ensuring user security and privacy. What qualifies as ""reasonable"" remains undetermined, with the court suggesting Apple and Epic negotiate or let a judge decide.The ruling represents a significant shift for Apple's lucrative services business, which has continued growing even as iPhone sales slowed. Apple currently takes up to 30% of every dollar spent through its App Store—a practice that's faced mounting legal and regulatory challenges for years.Wall Street appears cautiously optimistic about Apple's prospects, with the stock relatively unchanged since the ruling. Investors likely expect appeals to continue, though the court's finding of willful violation and bad faith strengthens Epic's position.The ultimate impact depends on whether developers and consumers embrace external payment options, even with potential savings. Sweeney acknowledged many developers haven't followed Epic's lead due to ""fear of retaliation"" from Apple. Whether this ruling finally breaks that pattern could determine if it truly marks the end of the Apple Tax.","A federal appeals court has largely upheld a contempt finding against Apple.
