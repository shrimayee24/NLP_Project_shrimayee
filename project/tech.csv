In a major push to consolidate its presence in the Indian market, OpenAI has announced that it will offer ChatGPT Go free to all users in India starting November 4.

Strengthening Dubai’s parking infrastructure









As Dubai’s commercial districts continue to expand, its streets are adapting. Parkin PJSC, the emirate’s largest public parking operator, has added paid parking zones in Dubai Studio City and Dubai Outsource City, effective 31 October. Clearly marked T-code areas now provide structured parking for workers, residents, and visitors in two of the city’s busiest business hubs.Parkin confirmed the introduction of two new paid parking zones under the T-code system — Zone Code 675T in Dubai Studio City and Zone Code 812T in Dubai Outsource City. Clear signboards have been installed throughout both locations to identify the designated areas.Paid parking operates daily from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., with the following tariff structure:These rates align with Parkin’s broader T-code pricing framework applied in several of Dubai’s newly developed areas.Residents and professionals working in Dubai Studio City and Dubai Outsource City can also access Parkin’s subscription plans, designed for regular or long-term parking users. The subscription packages are priced as follows:These options provide cost savings and convenience for individuals who park frequently within these zones, particularly those employed in the area’s media, technology, and outsourcing sectors.The addition of the new T-code zones follows a series of expansions undertaken by Parkin throughout 2024. In August, new paid parking zones were introduced in Al Jaddaf, with Zone 326C (on-street) and Zone 326D (off-street) implementing variable charges that differ between peak and non-peak hours.During the same period, Parkin brought 2,100 parking spaces across 59 mosques in Dubai under its management. Worshippers are entitled to one hour of free parking during prayer times, while standard paid parking applies outside those hours.Earlier in the year, the operator introduced additional zones in Mirdif, which remain free on Sundays and public holidays and feature variable fees based on demand. A new parking zone was also announced in Al Khail Gate in July, further broadening Parkin’s reach across the emirate.Parkin’s latest expansion underscores its central role in shaping Dubai’s public parking infrastructure. By extending managed parking to fast-growing commercial areas such as Dubai Studio City and Dubai Outsource City, the company continues to support urban development with organised, technology-driven parking solutions.As Dubai’s population and business activity expand, these additions reflect a consistent strategy: extending accessibility, ensuring clarity through signposted zones, and offering flexible options for both short-term visitors and long-term residents.","Parkin PJSC, the emirate’s largest public parking operator, has added paid parking zones in Dubai Studio City and Dubai Outsource City, effective 31 October.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

"UAE: Delivery riders in Dubai and Sharjah face Dh1,500 fines and permit suspensions under new traffic rules",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-delivery-riders-in-dubai-and-sharjah-face-dh1500-fines-and-permit-suspensions-under-new-traffic-rules/articleshow/124986325.cms,"UAE tightens traffic rules to protect delivery riders / AI-generated illustration

New lane rules for delivery riders in Dubai and Sharjah

What’s changing: Penalties and monitoring

What delivery riders and customer should know

For delivery riders:

From Nov 1, check which lanes you’re allowed to use — it depends on the road width. Be aware of heightened surveillance (cameras, radars) and steeper fines/permit risks. Speed-limit behaviour is under sharper scrutiny.

For delivery companies:

Make sure riders are informed and trained on new rules. Update routing so bikes avoid prohibited lanes — this may affect delivery time slightly. Monitor riders’ permit status and company liability in case of violations.

For customers and general road users:

Expect improvements in lane discipline and perhaps fewer accidents involving delivery bikes. Delivery-times might get affected in the fine-tuning period. Awareness of the rules might help smoother traffic flow.

Conclusion





Food may still come fast, but delivery riders won’t be allowed to race to get it to you anymore. In a joint announcement made in late October 2025, Dubai’s RTA and Sharjah Police unveiled tough new traffic rules for delivery riders, warning that reckless riding could now lead to Dh1,500 fines, suspended permits, and even platform bans. The message from authorities is clear: safety over speed.From November 1, 2025, the emirates of Dubai and Sharjah will see strict new regulations targeting delivery motorcycles and heavy-vehicles. In Dubai, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in coordination with Dubai Police will ban delivery riders from using the fastest lanes on major roads. On roads with five or more lanes, they cannot ride in the two leftmost (fastest) lanes; on roads with three or four lanes, they cannot use the leftmost lane. This change follows a rise in road accidents involving delivery riders.In Sharjah, authorities are implementing a dedicated lane-management system: heavy-vehicles and buses must keep to the far-right lanes, while motorcycles (including delivery bikes) will be restricted to the middle or right lanes depending on road width (for example: on a four-lane road they can use the two right-most lanes; on a two-lane road only the right lane).Enforcement will rely on smart radars, high-definition cameras and 24-hour monitoring.The new rules aren’t just about new signs, they come with significant consequences. In Dubai, fines start at AED 500 for a first offence, AED 700 for the second offence, and on the third violation the delivery rider’s permit may be suspended. Violations of speed limits (exceeding 100 km/h) by delivery bikes are also targeted: the first time AED 200, rising to AED 300 and AED 400 for repeat offences. In Sharjah, heavy vehicles failing to stay in designated lanes face fines up to AED 1,500 plus 12 traffic-black-points; riders ignoring lane signs may face fines around AED 500.The motive behind the crackdown: a steep rise in accidents involving delivery riders and the growing number of delivery bikes on the road, prompted by booming e-commerce and food-delivery sectors. These measures form part of broader traffic-safety strategies focusing on enforcement, road engineering and awareness campaigns.This crackdown signals that Dubai and Sharjah are taking the surge in delivery-motorcycle traffic seriously, and moving from reactive to proactive traffic-safety governance. By restricting faster lanes and enforcing penalties, authorities hope to reduce reckless riding, collisions and fatalities. For riders it means adaptation; for everyone else it means potentially safer roads and clearer separation of different types of vehicles.If you’re involved in the delivery business (rider, fleet manager, platform) or you’re a road user in these emirates, mark the date November 1, 2025, the rules change then. Being aware today means avoiding fines tomorrow.","From November 1, 2025, the emirates of Dubai and Sharjah will see strict new regulations targeting delivery motorcycles and heavy-vehicles.

Spanish photographer captures the world’s first leucistic Iberian lynx in the wild





Understanding Leucism: Nature’s genetic rarity





How Spain helped the Iberian lynx make an amazing comeback





White Iberian lynx becomes a powerful symbol of hope and wildlife conservation

A rare white Iberian lynx has been spotted in Spain’s Jaén mountains, marking a significant milestone in wildlife conservation and genetic diversity studies. The pale, cream-coated feline is believed to be the first leucistic Iberian lynx ever recorded, displaying partial pigment loss rather than full albinism. Despite its unusual colouring, the lynx retains its sharp eyes and dark ear tufts, characteristic of the species and essential for survival in the wild. Experts and conservationists have hailed the sighting as proof of successful conservation initiatives that helped rescue the Iberian lynx from near extinction. Once numbering fewer than 100 in 2002, the population now exceeds 2,000, thanks to habitat restoration, genetic monitoring, and breeding programmes, making this rare white lynx a living symbol of nature’s resilience and recovery.The remarkable discovery was made by Spanish wildlife photographer Ángel Hidalgo, who managed to capture video footage of the elusive feline. Despite numerous failed attempts in the past, Hidalgo’s patience and persistence finally paid off when his camera traps recorded the pale lynx in the wild.“I’ve been setting up cameras for years, with many failed attempts and long hours of work. But this time, nature gave me something truly unique,” Hidalgo said after confirming the footage.The lynx in question exhibits leucism, a rare genetic condition that causes partial pigment loss in the animal’s fur. Unlike albinism which results in a complete lack of colour and often affects eyesight leucism allows normal eye pigmentation and overall healthy development. The animal retains its piercing amber eyes, dark ear tufts, and characteristic facial ruff, distinguishing it as a true Iberian lynx despite its unusual coat.Leucism is a genetic anomaly seen occasionally in birds and mammals, but it is extremely rare in wild felines. It occurs when pigment-producing cells fail to develop properly, leading to lighter or patchy colouring. In the case of the Iberian lynx, this trait makes the animal stand out vividly against its natural surroundings.While the lynx’s pale coat is visually stunning, experts note that it also presents survival challenges. The lack of camouflage may make it more visible to both predators and prey, potentially affecting its hunting success and safety. Because of this, the authorities have chosen to keep the exact location of the sighting secret to protect the lynx from potential harm or human interference.Just over two decades ago, the Iberian lynx was one of the world’s most endangered cats, teetering on the edge of extinction. In 2002, fewer than 100 individuals remained in the wild, their population devastated by habitat loss, poaching, and a decline in their primary prey rabbits.Spain’s intensive conservation programmes, supported by the European Union’s Life Projects and various NGOs, have since transformed the species’ fate. Breeding centres, habitat restoration efforts, and reintroduction initiatives helped boost the population dramatically. By 2015, the number of adult lynxes had risen to over 400, and as of 2025, there are estimated to be around 2,000 individuals thriving across southern Spain and parts of Portugal.The sighting of the white lynx serves as tangible proof that these efforts are paying off. It demonstrates not only the species’ genetic diversity but also nature’s ability to rebound when given the chance.For conservationists, this pale predator represents more than a rare genetic twist, it’s a symbol of resilience and renewal. The lynx’s re-emergence from near extinction is already considered one of Europe’s greatest wildlife recovery stories. The appearance of this leucistic individual adds an almost poetic chapter to that narrative.Social media users have been equally captivated by the discovery. Photos and clips of the lynx quickly went viral, with people expressing awe and admiration for both the animal’s ethereal beauty and the conservationists who made its survival possible. One commenter aptly wrote, “Nature keeps reminding us how much beauty still exists when we care enough to protect it.”","Spanish photographer captures the world’s first leucistic Iberian lynx in the wild.

A castle’s hidden companion



From grape to glass: how the Romans made wine

A glimpse into late Roman life





Archaeologists in Turkey have unearthed a remarkably preserved 1,600-year-old Roman wine production site beneath the ruins of an ancient mountain castle. The discovery, made near the village of Oymakli in southeastern Turkey’s Kahta district, sheds light on the scale and sophistication of winemaking in the late Roman period. The site includes grape-crushing installations, cisterns, and grinding stones, all remarkably intact after more than a millennium. Experts believe the complex once operated as a large-scale industrial winery, serving both local residents and the nearby Kahta Castle, an important stronghold during the Kingdom of Commagene.The excavation, led by the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism, began after archaeologists discovered fragments of stone and pottery believed to be of historical value. The site spans nearly 37 acres and lies in a mountainous region overlooking the Euphrates River valley.Researchers found several installations used to crush grapes and channel juice into cisterns for fermentation and storage. Grinding stones and remnants of clay vessels suggest the factory also produced flour and possibly olive oil, hinting at a wider agricultural economy.According to Mehmet Alkan, provincial museum director, the site’s foundations survived “remarkably well” despite being built from irregular stones.“Its preservation offers an exceptional look into ancient craftsmanship and industrial-scale production,” he said.The ancient wineworks lie close to Kahta Castle, a fortress originally built in the 2nd century BC for the Kingdom of Commagene, a Greco-Iranian dynasty that thrived before Roman annexation. Archaeologists believe the site may have once served both as a production hub and as a residential settlement for those who worked at or supplied the castle.Given the castle’s position on a major trade route between Mesopotamia and Anatolia, experts say the winery could have played a key role in provisioning the garrison and exporting wine across the region. The discovery provides rare evidence of how local economies functioned under Roman rule in Anatolia’s remote mountain regions.The structures uncovered mirror other Roman-era wineries found across the Mediterranean. Grapes were likely pressed manually or with wooden beams, allowing juice to flow through carved channels into stone basins. From there, it would have been stored in large clay jars, or amphorae, to ferment.Archaeologists also uncovered cisterns carved directly into rock, which would have stored water essential for both winemaking and daily life in this dry region. The presence of such facilities suggests that the complex operated at an industrial scale, far beyond the needs of a single household.Dating to the 4th century AD, the site falls within a period when Christianity was spreading through the Roman Empire and Constantinople was emerging as its new capital. The discovery shows that even in remote provinces, life thrived through trade, agriculture, and craftsmanship.The blend of Roman engineering and local traditions in the architecture highlights the cultural fusion that defined this era. “This settlement reflects both Roman influence and Anatolian adaptation,” researchers noted in their preliminary report.","Archaeologists in Turkey have unearthed a remarkably preserved 1,600-year-old Roman wine production site beneath the ruins of an ancient mountain castle.

Fans accuse RM of “changing tone” and ignoring early Asian trailblazers

Supporters say RM’s comments were misunderstood and reflect growth







BTS leader RM has found himself at the center of another social media storm after a resurfaced discussion online reignited debate over his attitude toward fellow artists. The controversy began after clips and comments showed RM’s recent statements about respecting other musicians, a sentiment that some fans felt marked a sharp change from his earlier public tone.Many users were quick to highlight what they saw as inconsistency, accusing him of hypocrisy, while others jumped to his defense, claiming his words were being taken out of context. The debate quickly took over platforms like X and TikTok, reigniting old fandom divisions and raising questions about celebrity accountability in the K-pop world.Social media lit up with criticism, with one user @mczist writing, “He's a straight up narcissist, always boasting about himself n discredits smaller artists, don't let the media play fool you, he has 0 humility or respect for others.” Another user @AMZOJU wrote, “Oh now he cares about other artists? When few years ago him and his group refuse to mention any other artists but themselves, the hypocrisy.”Another user @_bitchgtfo wrote, “Him always acting so moralistic and diplomatic when in reality he is just a raging misogynist, narcissistic, racist, colourist, egocentric, sexist, pro nazi, zionist enabler, investor of AI company coz he's a weirdo, p*rn addict and gets off to books with sexual violence theme.”The comments captured the frustration of some people who believe RM and BTS have historically focused on their own success while overlooking other Asian acts that paved the way internationally.Others pointed to earlier generations of artists like Wonder Girls and Psy, who broke into Western markets years before BTS’s global rise. Fans argued that those acts deserve more acknowledgment for their contributions to K-pop’s international expansion.On the other hand, RM’s defenders argued that the backlash was exaggerated and unfair. Many said his recent remarks showed personal and artistic growth rather than contradiction, suggesting that public perception of his “tone shift” was being influenced by selective editing and old biases.Still, neither RM nor his label, HYBE, have released a statement addressing the controversy. For now, the conversation continues to unfold online, with fans divided between defending the rapper’s maturity and questioning his sincerity. Regardless of opinion, the debate underscores how every word from BTS members carries massive global weight and how RM, in particular, remains one of K-pop’s most scrutinized figures.Also Read: Is NewJeans really staying with ADOR?

Fact vs Fiction





The Bigger Picture





The Bottom Line









The internet can turn a concept sketch into a global sensation. In late October 2025, millions of people across X, TikTok, and YouTube watched a video showing what appeared to be a floating football stadium — a glowing bowl suspended 350 metres above the desert, nestled within Saudi Arabia’s futuristic city, NEOM: The Line. The captions were breathless: this was, they claimed, the NEOM Sky Stadium, a billion-dollar venue for the 2034 FIFA World Cup.It looked like the future of football. It wasn’t.Saudi Arabia’s official bid book for the 2034 FIFA World Cup lists 15 stadiums across Riyadh, Jeddah, Al Khobar, Abha, and NEOM. One of them, the NEOM Stadium, is described as being “more than 350 metres above ground level, within The Line.”That last phrase — “within The Line” — is what caused all the confusion.The stadium isn’t floating on a tower. It’s designed to be inside The Line’s vertical structure, part of a multi-level megacity that stacks entire neighbourhoods in layers. The stadium will occupy the fourth and fifth levels of this vast mirrored structure, making it high-altitude, but still fully enclosed.As ESPN reported, “the actual stadium proposed for construction in NEOM has been officially listed as one of the 15 host stadiums being either renovated or built from scratch for the FIFA 2034 World Cup for almost a year, and the Saudis do plan for it to be 350 metres above the ground.That is because they plan for it to form part of The Line, a proposed smart, green city in NEOM that will eventually extend in linear fashion for over 100 miles across the northwest Saudi province of Tabuk by 2045, powered entirely by renewable energy. ”Planned to seat around 46,000 spectators, the venue will be powered entirely by renewable energy and surrounded by a sports and wellness district, complete with hotels, apartments, and an electric transport network. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2027 and finish between 2032 and 2039, though The Line itself remains in its early stages of development.The viral clips of a glowing stadium hovering above the desert are not official footage. They were created by AI artists and CGI design accounts using programs such as Midjourney and Unreal Engine, taking NEOM’s futuristic imagery and exaggerating it for dramatic effect.Architectural analysts have pointed out the visual giveaways: lighting that doesn’t behave naturally, impossible reflections, and looping crowds that repeat in perfect synchrony. Even the drone-like camera sweeps in these videos defy real-world physics.NEOM’s official social media channels have not commented on these viral clips, and no government or FIFA outlet has ever released or endorsed them. The denials have instead come from journalists and design experts who confirmed that no such renders appear in the official World Cup bid or in NEOM’s verified materials.Several viral claims have blurred the line between fact and fantasy. The notion that Saudi Arabia is building a floating arena is false — official documents make clear the stadium is built within The Line’s vertical city, not on top of it. The circulating videos aren’t real construction footage; they’re AI-created visuals shared by fan-art accounts. Some users claimed Saudi officials had released these renders, but there’s no public statement or official post confirming or denying them. And despite online speculation, no construction has started; the project remains in its design phase, with The Line itself still under early development.Saudi Arabia’s 2034 World Cup forms part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030, a massive plan to transform the Kingdom into a global hub for sport, tourism, and technology. Projects such as The Line, Qiddiya, and New Murabba symbolise this futuristic ambition.Yet these megaprojects also face heavy criticism. Human-rights groups have documented forced evictions, executions of displaced tribespeople, and labour exploitation linked to NEOM’s construction. For many, the shimmering renderings of desert utopias mask a harsher reality on the ground.So while the AI-generated “stadium in the sky” dazzles online, the real story is more grounded — a mix of breathtaking ambition, architectural experimentation, and moral controversy.Saudi Arabia’s “Stadium in the Sky” exists only on screens. There is a NEOM Stadium planned for the 2034 World Cup — a high-altitude arena built within a vertical city, not floating above it. The viral clips showing a glowing bowl suspended over the desert are digital illusions, not construction updates. Like much of NEOM itself, the stadium represents a dream halfway between technology and theatre — where aspiration meets illusion, and the future of football is still being rendered.","Saudi Arabia’s official bid book for the 2034 FIFA World Cup lists 15 stadiums across Riyadh, Jeddah, Al Khobar, Abha, and NEOM.

UAE: Indian embassy announces three new Indian passport designs for residents with advanced security features,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-indian-embassy-announces-three-new-indian-passport-designs-for-residents-with-advanced-security-features/articleshow/124910973.cms,"UAE unveils three new Indian passport designs today / AI-generated illustration

Indian passport in UAE hits historic moment

What the three designs are and why it matters?

The older paper-based booklet (standard booklet issued before migration to machine-readable passports).

A machine-readable version with upgraded security features and newer cover design.

The latest e-passport series with an embedded chip and digital security, under the Passport Seva 2.0 rollout.

How it affects Indian expats in the UAE

What you should do now

Check which booklet series you hold and keep all pages in good condition (especially first and last pages).

When renewing, consider opting for the e-passport with a chip that offers longer validity, enhanced security, and easier travel clearance.

Retain copies (digital and paper) of your older passport if you are transitioning between designs, this helps avoid hiccups in sponsorship or residency records.

Stay tuned to official announcements from the Indian Embassy and Consulates in the UAE, changes to fees, booklet formats and services often come with some preparation time.





Indian expats in the UAE are witnessing a first-of-its-kind change, as the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi confirmed on October 28, 2025, that three different Indian passport designs are now officially in circulation the older booklet, the machine-readable version, and the newly introduced chip-enabled e-passport. The announcement marks a historic moment for the UAE’s Indian community, as the latest design under India’s Passport Seva 2.0 initiative brings enhanced security features, a smart embedded chip, and a refreshed visual layout, while older formats remain valid until expiry.Indian citizens residing in the UAE are now witnessing a unique first: three completely different Indian passport booklet designs in circulation at the same time. The development was reported by Gulf News, noting that expulsions of earlier classes and renewals mean holders could possess booklets of different series concurrently.Until recently, most Indian passport-holders abroad typically carried one design at a time: the older booklets, the newer machine-readable ones, or the latest biometric e-passports. But now, especially for the large Indian expatriate community in the UAE, all three are valid and in use.This arrangement creates both opportunity and confusion: renewal options, travel formalities, and verification processes may differ depending on which booklet a holder owns.The three designs currently in use include:For Indian expatriates in the UAE that means several practical implications: if you hold an older design passport you might face a different renewal fee, you may be required to convert to the new format sooner, and immigration authorities may ask for extra verification when travelling. Gulf News emphasised that all three booklets currently remain valid—but you must ensure your travel and visa arrangements recognise them.The Indian community in the UAE is among the world’s largest diaspora groups, making this passport transition especially significant. The rollout of the e-passport series coincides with the digitalisation of consular services at the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate in Dubai, which announced new online portals and chip-embedded passports effective from 28 October 2025.For UAE-based Indian expats, key take-aways to remember include: ensuring your passport booklet is valid for at least six months before travel; if you hold an older series, consider upgrading to the e-passport system to access newer services; keep a close eye on renewal fee changes; and confirm that your visa or employer sponsorship status remains valid even if your booklet changes designIf you’re an Indian passport-holder in the UAE:This simultaneous circulation of three distinct passport designs may feel unusual, but it clearly reflects India’s ongoing move toward technological and service upgrades for its expanding global citizenry. For Indian expats in the UAE, it’s less about which specific booklet you hold and more about ensuring your travel, residency, and renewal documents remain valid and widely recognised. Secure your booklet, stay informed, and you’ll be fully ready for this exciting new phase of passport evolution.","Indian citizens residing in the UAE are witnessing a unique first: three completely different Indian passport booklet designs in circulation at the same time.

Have you heard the buzz? Saudi Arabia isn't just building futuristic cities; they're launching a legendary way to see the country! It's called the 'Dream of the Desert,' and trust me, this isn't your average train ride, it’s the Middle East's first five-star luxury train, and it’s going to redefine desert travel.“Dream of the Desert” is Saudi Arabia’s new ultra-luxury train project designed as a moving palace, part hotel, part restaurant, part cultural showcase. It’s being built by Italy’s Arsenale Group in partnership with Saudi Arabia Railways and several Saudi authorities as part of the kingdom’s push to expand high-end tourism under Vision 2030The ‘Dream of the Desert’ project was officially announced in Riyadh by Saudi Arabia Railways (SAR) in collaboration with Italy’s Arsenale Group, the company behind several luxury train and hospitality concepts worldwide. The announcement was made as part of Saudi Arabia’s ongoing push to elevate tourism and luxury travel offerings under the Vision 2030 strategy.Senior SAR officials, along with Arsenale’s leadership, revealed key details of the project, highlighting Saudi Arabia’s ambition to bring a world-class rail tourism experience to the region for the first time. The announcement also emphasized how the train will blend Saudi heritage, high-end hospitality, and slow-travel luxury, catering to both international tourists and premium local travellers.The journey itself is designed to be an immersive exploration of the Kingdom, not just a quick ride.

The 'Dream of the Desert' is incredibly exclusive, with just 66 guests allowed on board at any time.So, when can you actually go?

UK launches first digital ID: Is it similar to India's Aadhaar? Full details of the plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-launches-first-digital-id-is-it-similar-to-indias-aadhaar-full-details-of-the-plan/articleshow/124630189.cms,"AI image used for representative purpose

Why UK government launched this plan



What is the use of ID?



How Veteran can use access digital IDs?



Is it similar to India?







The UK government launched the digital version of its ID scheme on Friday, intended for former members of the armed services.This ID will mean passports, driving licenses, national insurance cards, and many more being virtual, instead of—or as well as—being stored in a shoebox or under socks in a drawer, Sky News reported.The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.The govt claims the initiative is designed to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for those without status to secure employment.Ministers contend that the ability to obtain jobs is a primary attraction for migrants entering the UK unlawfully. Under the new system, employers will no longer be able to depend on National Insurance numbers—which currently serve as part of proof of the right to work—or on paper-based verification methods, BBC reported.""At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy—people sharing National Insurance numbers for example. The idea is that having a picture attached would make it—in theory—harder to abuse that system,"" a government spokesperson explained.The digital IDs, which will be app-based and stored on smartphones akin to the NHS App or digital bank cards, will contain information such as the holder's residency status, name, date of birth, nationality, and a photograph.Sir Keir, when announcing the scheme, stated: ""You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that.""From today, Friday 17 October, it will give ex-soldiers a seamless way to confirm their status in person and will include information already featured on their physical card with the security features that protect their personal information.Ministers hope the digital veteran card will show how the technology works and quash public concerns about privacy and security.Veterans will now be able to hold their credentials in a smartphone app called Gov.uk One Login. The govt had previously announced that digital credentials, including the veteran card, would be stored in an app named Gov.uk Wallet. It now states it will “transition to talking about [One Login] as the Gov.uk Wallet” as more govt-issued credentials become available digitally. The credential will be stored under encryption in the app, similar to how a train or concert ticket is held in an Apple or Google wallet, The Guardian reported.Verification using face ID or a fingerprint will be required to access it, and the govt claims it is safer than physical IDs. Another version of the credential will be held by the Ministry of Defence, and as more IDs are added, the information will remain with each issuer and in the citizens’ app, ensuring there is no central database of all ID data, thereby avoiding what some have feared could be a “honeypot for hackers”.India has well established digital ID system. India’s digital ID system, Aadhaar, is significantly larger and more detailed than the UK’s planned system.New Delhi stores citizens’ fingerprints, eye scans, photos, home addresses and phone numbers, with the system processing approximately 80 million authentications daily.Under Aadhaar, every Indian citizen receives a 12-digit number intended to replace numerous paper documents. All adults and children over the age of five must provide biometric information. The system verifies identities for activities such as opening bank accounts or applying for new SIM cards. It also aimed to streamline the disbursement of govt benefits, providing holders with instant proof of identity and access to basic services.Aadhaar and UK's digital ID seems to be same.India also have other apps like DigiLocker, where you can store all the important documents like Aadhar Card, Pan card, driving license digitally at one place, Digi Yatra and many more.The UK's digital ID seems to be following the similar model of India. Like DigiLocker, UK is introducing Gov.UK Wallet. Few days ago, UK PM Keir Starmer made his first trip to India and hailed India’s ID system as a “massive success”.During his trade-centric visit to Mumbai, Starmer also met with Nandan Nilekani, co-founder and chair of Indian tech services group Infosys, who led the govt body responsible for delivering the ID database more than a decade ago.",The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.

Professors caught them cheating & fudging attendance. They used AI to apologise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/professors-caught-them-cheating-fudging-attendance-they-used-ai-to-apologise/articleshow/124979331.cms,"



Confronted with allegations that they had cheated in an introductory data science course and fudged their attendance, dozens of undergraduates at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign recently sent two professors a mea culpa via email. But there was one problem, a glaring one: They had not written the emails. Artificial intelligence had, according to the professors, Karle Flanagan and Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider, an academic pair known to their students and social media followers as the Data Science Duo.The students got their comeuppance in a large lecture hall on Oct 17, when the professors read aloud their identical, less-than-genuine apologies from a projector screen, video from that class showed. Busted.The professors posted about it on social media, where the gotcha moment drew widespread attention.""They said, 'Dear Professor Flanagan, I want to sincerely apologise,'"" Professor Flanagan said. ""And I was like, Thank you. They're owning up to it. They're apologising. And then I got another email, the second email, and then the third. And then everybody sort of sincerely apologising, and suddenly it became a little less sincere.""At a time when educational institutions are grappling with the intrusion of machine learning into classrooms and homework assignments, the university professors said they decided to use the episode to teach a lesson in academic integrity. They did not take disciplinary action against the students. ""You can hear the students laugh in the background of the video,"" Professor Fagen-Ulmschneider said. ""They very well knew that it was something that they could see themselves doing. ""Although the university's student code covers cheating and plagiarism, the professors said that they were not aware of specific rules applying to the use of AI.Allison Copenbarger Vance, a deputy associate chancellor, said in an email that the students would not be punished. ""At the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, it is the discretion of faculty to clearly define the boundaries in their syllabi for using AI in student work,"" she said. Referring to Professor Flanagan, she added, ""In this case, the students' behaviour didn't violate the policies outlined in her syllabus, so no disciplinary action was warranted. ""Vinayak Bagdi, 21, who graduated in May with a degree in statistics, took the class as a freshman to fulfill his academic requirements. Four years later, he said, the professors' dedication to demystifying statistics had stuck with him. He described the professors as being heavily invested in the success of students. That made it disheartening that some students had used AI, Bagdi said. ""You're not even coming to the class, and then you can't even send a sincere email to the professor saying, 'I apologise'?"" he said. ""Out of any class at university, why skip that one?""

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

What can you do in such situations







Former partners can exploit a flaw in Apple 's Family Sharing feature. A recent report found that the feature’s single-organiser design was misused by a woman’s ex-partner even when a custodial parent had a court order. According to a report by Wired, a mother identified as Kate reported her ex-husband, the designated organiser, was using the feature for coercive control. Her ex-husband allegedly tracked their children’s locations and imposed ""draconian limits"" on screen time during her custody days while lifting them on his own. The system's flaw is that it gives all control to one parent, leaving the non-organiser parent unable to transfer children to a new family group without the organiser's consent.Kate recounted,Still, Apple's support staff stated their hands werethe report noted, citing the woman.In such cases, the usual recommendation is to stop using the existing accounts and create new Apple IDs. However, doing so results in the loss of all purchased apps, and more importantly, photos and videos that may hold years of memories.Apple introduced the Family Sharing feature with iOS 8 in 2014.

Parents can also approve their children’s purchases directly from their own devices.In addition to managing App Store and iTunes purchases, Family Sharing lets you see your children’s locations through Find My Friends and helps locate their devices using Find My iPhone.It also allows you to set up a shared family calendar, reminder list, and photo album that everyone in the group can access and edit.","Apple's Family Sharing feature gives all control to one parent.
