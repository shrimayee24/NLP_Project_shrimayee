The strategist is no longer human

NEW DELHI: For a decade, Prashant Kishor has been India’s undisputed master craftsman of elections, the strategist who could bend narratives, stitch coalitions and turn sentiment into seats to deliver wins for major politicians. The 2025 Bihar assembly polls, however, delivered a jolt: Kishor, despite months of padyatras, booth-level outreach and the full weight of Jan Suraaj, failed to win a single seat.The upset was more than a personal setback. It signalled a shift already unfolding beneath the surface: the old era of political strategy, built on instinct, experience and human networks, is being steadily eclipsed by a new actor that never tires, never forgets and never stops optimising.The 2020s have introduced a political strategist unlike any before: Artificial Intelligence (AI).Always awake, endlessly scalable and capable of producing personalised persuasion at a fraction of the cost of a conventional campaign team. By 2025, influence is no longer crafted by professionals in war rooms; it is engineered by algorithms fine-tuned to voters’ moods in real-time.The story is no longer only about deepfakes. This is no longer simply about mimicking politicians or reviving long-deceased icons of a political past.The larger threat and opportunity lie in AI’s capacity for persuasion.Studies published this year show that AI chatbots can shift voting attitudes at rates far higher than traditional advertising. Politicians once needed speeches, rallies and media placements to move the needle. In 2024, a ten-message exchange with a chatbot has been shown to deliver greater impact than a multimillion-dollar television campaign.Artificial intelligence has crept into election campaigns around the world, not as a novelty but as a tool for influence. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, political parties harnessed generative AI to navigate the country’s linguistic diversity, translating speeches into regional languages and producing personalised outreach that addressed local audiences.AI tools also created images, videos and voice clips that were widely shared on social media and messaging apps, blurring the line between genuine and fake political content.In the United States, AI was used less for resurrecting figures than for shaping narratives. Advanced models generated millions of messages, memes and automated responses designed to appeal to specific voter groups, turning broad campaigning into hyper-targeted persuasion.MIT researchers have documented how AI can produce and test myriad versions of political content, learning over time which messages resonate most.What makes the current wave of AI so powerful isn’t just its reach, but its precision. Campaign tech can tailor content not just for broad demographics, but for specific segments — and increasingly, for individuals.Using voter data and language models, parties can now generate personalised videos, voice messages or WhatsApp clips that address voters by name or reference hyper-local issues. In India’s 2024 elections, some campaigns reportedly used AI to send personalised campaign messages to local volunteers or voters with voice-cloned content that sounded like a regional leader speaking directly to them.Here’s an example: below are two images placed side by side — one is real, and the other has been altered using AI. Can you tell which is which?If you’re comfortable with tech, the “obvious” choice might be the right-hand image as the AI-generated one. But in a world already overwhelmed with information and shrinking attention spans, it’s easy for many people to be misled.Not long ago, creating such an edit with traditional software would have taken hours of careful work. Now, AI can produce it in minutes with nothing more than a simple prompt.India’s size, linguistic diversity and enormous WhatsApp economy made it a live laboratory for election-grade AI. During the 2024 Lok Sabha campaign, parties experimented with voice clones, personalised videos and hyper-local ads that would once have required expensive local teams. Media reporting found that synthetic videos and voice cloning were deployed to reach voters in their own languages and dialects, sometimes resurrecting familiar faces to prompt nostalgia or loyalty. Deepfakes of late leaders such as M Karunanidhi and audio clones of Jayalalithaa circulated in campaign pockets and on WhatsApp.The 2025 Delhi election cycle illustrated the same duality of benefit and risk. Parties used AI to create slick creatives and chatbots that answered voters’ queries about municipal schemes and polling logistics.Rival campaigns, meanwhile, weaponised visuals and memes that many AI produced to caricature opponents and to amplify outrage on social platforms.Bihar showed how regulators and institutions had to catch up. Ahead of state polls, authorities moved to require labels and disclosures for AI content and warned parties about misuse. The Election Commission issued advisories asking parties to identify AI-created or digitally enhanced material and to remove misleading content promptly. That reflected mounting official concern that unlabelled synthetic media could distort voters’ understanding of where, when and how to vote.In Tamil Nadu politics, AI influence crossed into theatrical territory. Actor-politician Vijay’s party, Tamizhaga Vetri Kazhagam (TVK), released an AI-generated video showing CN Annadurai the iconic founder of rival DMK , appearing to endorse Vijay’s leadership over MK Stalin . The synthetic content drew widespread attention for its audacity and emotional appeal, using the late leader’s likeness and voice patterns in a campaign context.AI platforms can be combined into simple, high-impact campaign stacks.Real-time translation and localisation: Tools such as the Indian government’s Bhashini are already being used to translate speeches in real time and reach multilingual audiences in a single event. That makes national figures intelligible across linguistic divides.Personalised media: AI can insert a person’s name into a video or voice message, speak in a local dialect, and reference a local scheme to create the feel of a one-to-one conversation.Chatbots and P2P messaging: Campaign chatbots on messaging apps can answer voter queries, persuade undecided voters and provide step-by-step voting information. Early field trials suggest conversational bots can move turnout modestly when used responsibly.Synthetic resurrection: Voice cloning and face generation can create speeches and visuals of public figures, living or deceased. This can be used for commemorations or to amplify nostalgia, but it also creates a potent vector for deception.Micro-testing at scale: AI enables the automated generation of hundreds of message permutations and near-instant A/B testing to identify what language or framing works for which segment.The promise of AI for civic inclusion is real. Translation and simplification can make policy accessible. Chatbots can help elderly or remote voters get polling details. Yet the same features that improve outreach also enable deception at scale. The question facing democracies is not whether to use AI but how to shape rules and infrastructure so the technology empowers voters and not predators.Regulatory responses are emerging. The EC has moved to require prominent labelling of synthetic material and to instruct parties to maintain records of AI-created campaign content. Platforms have experimented with provenance labels and ad disclosure rules. At the technical level, researchers and agencies push watermarking, provenance metadata and detection tools.The lesson from recent elections is clear: AI hasn’t stolen votes, but it has quietly entered the game, learning fast and growing harder to contain with every cycle. Its impact depends on public awareness, transparency, and ethical use.Campaigns have always combined messaging, persuasion, and spectacle. AI doesn’t change politics; it accelerates it, sharpens it, and scales it beyond human limits. Just as TV reshaped image and social media reshaped attention, AI is reshaping trust.The strategist is no longer only human. That voice in your phone, that video in your feed, even that argument that swayed you, it may never have come from a person at all.","Artificial intelligence has crept into election campaigns around the world, not as a novelty but as a tool for influence.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Pakistan Army Spokesperson Faces Backlash for Winking at Reporter in Viral Video





It started with a simple question —— and ended in full-blown comedy inside Pakistan’s National Assembly.During Monday’s session of the National Assembly in Islamabad, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq found ten PKR 5,000 notes on the chamber floor and called for the owner to identify them.“Whose money is this? Whoever it belongs to, please raise your hand,” the Speaker asked, waving the bundle of notes in the air.Within seconds, 12–13 MPs raised their hands to claim the money. On seeing this, the Speaker quipped, “There are 10 notes, yet 12 owners.” Proceedings were briefly halted amid the laughter and confusion.A video of the episode went viral on social media, with many Pakistanis mocking their lawmakers. According to the viral video, the money was later retrieved by Muhammad Iqbal Afridi, an MP from Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, who collected it from the Assembly office.As the video gained traction, critics called for the MPs who raised their hands to be held in contempt of Parliament and dismissed.“The Speaker missed 25 calls from Sharif brothers,” tweeted Mahnoor Asif. Another user commented, “They take salaries and perks in millions, yet this is their state.”A user said, ""This is the time of the Parliament and the parliamentarians present in the Parliament Five thousand notes, one person's pocket and claimants of money—12 members of the National Assembly have raised their hands.

A pleasant and peaceful performance at Hangzhou Safari Park in East China’s Zhejiang Province on Saturday turned terrifying when a black bear suddenly attacked its keeper.Several videos are going viral on social media, showing audience members watching as two keepers guided two black bears onto the stage for another round of performance. One bear successfully performed, while the other, nearing the stage, pounced on its keeper and knocked him to the ground, Global News reported.The fallen keeper struggled to escape while nearby staff grabbed chairs and poles to separate the animal. After the bear was pulled away, it lunged at the keeper again, and staff had to use force to separate them.This footage prompted an online debate over whether animal performances should be banned. Other staff immediately intervened and used props to separate the bear from the keeper. Multiple social media users posted videos of the incident recorded during the bears’ show.The park explained that the incident occurred as the keeper was carrying a large bag of carrots and apples; the bear saw the bag, became excited, and pounced on the keeper in an attempt to get the food, according to the notice. The notice also stated that the keeper said the incident reminded him to be more careful in dealings with the bear in the future.The official social media account of Hangzhou Safari Park posted a notice on Saturday stating that neither the keeper nor the bear was injured.One user, Momo, on the China's social media platform commented, “Safety must be a priority, and we should have respect for animals. Never think of them as cute and docile, or that we can control them.”Another user, Zero Geqian Qianqian, also emphasised the need to focus on safety. Many others have called for the cancellation of animal performances. A user named “Don’t Call Me Ma Ma Ma” asked, “When will animal performances be canceled? Isn’t it in animals’ nature to be food-driven and protective of their food?”Some users expressed sympathy for the bear. A user named “The Girl is Out, I’m at Home” said, “A small bear is like a little baby. How could we make it perform? If it has apples, let it eat! If it were your child, would you make it perform first and then eat? If it’s hungry, then let it perform how to eat, it would be happier, the keeper and the bear would be more harmonious, and the audience would still enjoy it.”On the X also, several users commented on the video. One of the user said, ""I see why the Russians train with them 🤣🤣🤣 that bear is a professional grappler.""Another said, ""Maybe if we didn't lock these animals up for our own amusement they wouldn't attack people.""After the video of the bear attack went viral online and sparked debate, the park released a follow-up video showing that the bear and the keeper have since “reconciled.” While feeding the black bear carrots, the keeper gently petted its head and said, “If you want carrots, why did you snatch mine? [Even if you didn’t], I’ll still give you some.” The black bear stood calmly and ate peacefully, displaying a gentle demeanour.",A black bear suddenly attacked its keeper at Hangzhou Safari Park in East China's Zhejiang Province on Saturday.

RTA's immediate traffic impact

Why the work is happening?

Alternative roads and diversion

Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road (E311): This is the main parallel highway to Emirates Road. Motorists can transition to the E311 earlier in their journey, as it offers a vast network of interchanges that connect directly to areas like Al Barari, Dubai Investment Park (DIP), and ultimately the Jebel Ali area.

(E311): This is the main parallel highway to Emirates Road. Motorists can transition to the E311 earlier in their journey, as it offers a vast network of interchanges that connect directly to areas like Al Barari, Dubai Investment Park (DIP), and ultimately the Jebel Ali area. Sheikh Zayed Road (E11): While a much busier and more central route, the E11 runs closer to the coast and is often used as a long-distance alternative, particularly for those heading toward Jebel Ali Port or Abu Dhabi.

Dubai–Al Ain Road (E66): For traffic approaching the E611 from the eastern side of Dubai, the E66 serves as a critical connector. If the specific exit loops at the E611/Lehbab intersection are closed, drivers are advised to continue on the E66 and utilize the next available exit or interchange to double back or access local roads.

Al Yalayes Road (D57): This road is a high-capacity link, especially vital for commercial traffic moving from Jebel Ali Port and the surrounding Free Zone. It can be used to connect traffic between the Sheikh Zayed Road (E11) and the Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road (E311), effectively bypassing the core E611 work zone.





From Thursday, 11 December 2025, authorities will temporarily close the slip-road at Bridge No. 7 on Emirates Road for vehicles travelling from Ras Al Khaimah towards Al Dhaid. Motorists affected by the closure are being asked to use nearby alternatives such as Bridge No. 6 and the recently opened Khorfakkan Road Tunnel while the work is under way. The closure and diversion were publicly announced as part of traffic advisories issued on December 10.The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in Dubai issued a traffic alert announcing the immediate closure of a critical stretch on Emirates Road (E611). The closure specifically targeted the slip road used by northbound traffic heading towards the important Jebel Ali–Lehbab Road/Al Qudra Road junction.The work began on December 11, 2025, and was deemed essential to facilitate the complex construction required for a major upgrade project. Commuters traveling north on E611 who needed to exit at this point were immediately impacted and directed to use the newly implemented diversion routes signaled by the RTA.This closure is part of wider, phased improvements to the Emirates Road (E611) corridor designed to boost capacity and safety on one of the UAE’s main arterial routes.The stretch has been targeted for lane and interchange upgrades in a larger Dh750 million expansion plan launched earlier in 2025 that aims to increase lane capacity on key segments, shorten commute times and ease congestion for drivers travelling between Ras Al Khaimah, Umm Al Quwain, Sharjah and Dubai.That expansion includes widening lanes and upgrading interchange No. 7 with multiple new bridges, work planned to increase throughput and cut travel times sharply for long-distance commuters.For commuters whose primary route involves the E611 and requires an exit into the southern or western Dubai areas, several major arterial roads serve as primary alternatives, depending on the traveler's starting point:These detours were strategically planned to reroute vehicles around the construction zone, maintaining access to the critical roads which link key economic and residential districts, thus minimizing long-term disruption. This vital junction connects the major Emirates Road (E611) with the Jebel Ali-Lehbab Road and Al Qudra Road, making its smooth operation essential for the entire southern corridor of Dubai.",The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in Dubai issued a traffic alert announcing the immediate closure of a critical stretch on Emirates Road (E611) The closure specifically targeted the slip road used by northbound traffic heading towards the important Jebel Ali–Lehbab Road/Al Qudra Road junction.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125889079,imgsize-37730,width-400,resizemode-4/dubai-traffic.jpg"

Day 1 Abu Dhabi’s Bridge Summit

Idris Elba empowering Africa

$2.8 trillion revolution

‘Leapfrog’ advantage





Abu Dhabi’s BRIDGE Summit opened today (Dec 8, 2025), bringing together creators, platforms, investors and stars to map how AI, creators and global storytelling will reshape media. The three-day event mixes headliner keynotes, hands-on sessions and dealmaking, and the tone is unapologetically ambitious.The Bridge Summit 2025 officially kicked off today at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC), immediately setting a bold tone for the future of global media. Running for three days, the event has attracted a massive convergence of over 60,000 creatives, media specialists, artists, investors, and entrepreneurs.The scale is truly global, with more than 400 speakers, including policymakers and innovation leaders, and attendees from 182 countries.Organizers emphasized that the summit is designed to be the global industry’s new home, a dedicated space for forging high-value partnerships, developing production ecosystems, and exchanging expertise. As stated in the evocative opening film, the message is clear: ""Abu Dhabi is not looking toward the future; it is building it.""A major highlight was the panel featuring Hollywood superstar Idris Elba, who stated he views his own identity as a ""bridge"" between his heritage, the stories he tells, and global audiences. His core mission is to empower African creators and rewrite the continent's global narrative, which has long suffered from misrepresentation.Elba identified a critical issue: many African creators who achieve viral success are blocked from receiving earnings by banking restrictions and digital barriers. To solve this practical problem, he created Akunna (named after his middle name), a platform centered around the Akunna Wallet designed to ensure creators can actually be paid for their work.The opening sessions underscored the sheer economic power of the sector, noting that global media and entertainment generated over $2.8 trillion last year. The line between traditional creative fields is rapidly blurring; today, musicians are becoming developers, and filmmakers are building immersive digital worlds. Key discussions centered on technology, revealing that nearly 70% of content creators are already utilizing AI tools in their work.Speakers explored AI's promise for efficiency and scaling creativity, but also highlighted the associated risks to integrity, authorship, and truth. The consensus was that while AI is a powerful tool, the priority must be establishing frameworks to guide its ethical use and rebuild trust in an age of deepfakes and misinformation.Elba stressed that Africa has a unique advantage: the ability to ""leapfrog"" old infrastructure and build entirely new creative systems, citing the global success of Afrobeats as powerful proof. He argued that the potential for African gaming and fantasy is immense because it operates on a ""blank canvas.""However, he sharply criticized the lack of governmental support, pointing out that some African nations still do not have a dedicated film policy. His message to policymakers was direct: if you want a healthy creative ecosystem, you need infrastructure, distribution, and protection, not just conversation.He concluded that while AI is not the enemy, ""actual intelligence is more powerful than artificial intelligence,"" and requires strong frameworks to maintain authentic human creativity.Beyond panels, BRIDGE is a marketplace: organisers expect the summit to catalyse MoUs, studio deals and investment into production hubs and creative platforms. Abu Dhabi’s push to host the event signals a strategic shift, the emirate wants to be a media-tech crossroads that connects capital, talent and festivals.","The Bridge Summit 2025 officially kicked off today at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC) The event has attracted a massive convergence of over 60,000 creatives, media specialists, artists, investors, and entrepreneurs.

Madinah’s Taibah University action

Why this happened?

Advice for students and staff

What is Blackboard?





The academic routine at Taibah University in Madinah, Saudi Arabia , saw a sudden, mandatory shift this week, prioritizing the safety of its community over traditional classroom attendance. Taibah’s notice cites National Center of Meteorology reports as the reason for the suspension; students were directed to Blackboard for remote study instructions. The university announced the suspension of all in-person classes across its extensive network of campuses, immediately transitioning to a fully digital learning environment.The suspension of physical attendance applied comprehensively to the university’s main campus in Madinah and all of its subsidiary branches located throughout the wider Madinah region. This decision was specifically implemented for Monday, December 8, 2025. To ensure educational continuity without delay, all scheduled lessons and lectures were immediately converted to a distance learning format.The university confirmed that instruction would be conducted entirely through the established Blackboard system. This switch demonstrated the institution’s prepared infrastructure for managing disruptive events while upholding academic obligations.The critical reason behind the rapid change was a severe weather warning issued by the national meteorological body. The university’s announcement, reported by Al-Riaydh newspaper, was made following official reports from the National Center of Meteorology (NCM).These reports indicated the high probability of heavy rainfall across the area, posing a significant risk to commuters and campus safety. The primary motivation for the suspension, confirmed by university officials, was the deep concern for the safety of both students and administrative staff and faculty. The university affirmed that this pre-emptive step was taken in coordination with all relevant specialized authorities tasked with managing regional weather crises.Students and faculty should: (1) log into Blackboard before scheduled class times to confirm session links and any revised assessment arrangements; (2) follow Taibah University’s official social channels and the university portal for real-time notices; and (3) avoid travel to campus while alerts are active. The university’s message stresses that classes remain in session remotely, so attendance and coursework expectations continue as normal unless otherwise announced.Blackboard is Taibah University’s official online learning platform used to deliver classes, assignments, exams and course materials remotely. When in-person classes are suspended, Blackboard becomes the main way for students and teachers to continue lessons without interruption.Students can access Blackboard through the university portal or the mobile app. After logging in with their university ID, they can open each course page to find live class links, lecture recordings, assignments and announcements. Teachers may also upload new schedules or send messages about any changes. Students should keep notifications enabled and check their course dashboards regularly, especially during weather-related closures.The decision by Taibah University reflects a broader pattern of instability in the region's weather conditions. Contextual reports, including the Saudi Gazette, confirmed that the NCM had warned of a widespread rainy spell commencing around this time, affecting not only Madinah but also neighboring regions like the Makkah highlands.","Taibah University in Madinah, Saudi Arabia, suspended all in-person classes this week.

Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has completed 595 new public bus passenger shelters across key locations, bringing the wider shelter project to about 89% completion of the target 762 units. The RTA says the rollout forms part of a long-term plan to modernise street-level public transport infrastructure and make waiting for buses more comfortable and reliable for everyone.The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in Dubai has reached a major milestone in modernizing the city’s public transport network, rolling out hundreds of state-of-the-art bus shelters. This ambitious initiative aims to construct a total of 762 sophisticated shelters by the end of 2025.To date, the project is near completion, with 595 shelters already installed, marking a substantial 89% overall progress. This upgrade is far more than an aesthetic facelift; it’s a pivotal step toward cultivating an integrated urban environment that supports sustainability and enhances the daily lives of residents and visitors.The strategic importance of this project is immense, as the bus network currently serves over 192 million passengers annually.To maximize efficiency and ridership, the RTA carefully selected locations based on future demand, high population density, and the need for integration with other ""soft mobility"" options. Many of the new stops are major hubs, designed to handle high volumes of traffic, with certain locations serving more than ten bus routes per shelter.The new shelters boast a sleek, contemporary aesthetic that perfectly complements Dubai’s modern architectural landscape. However, the true transformation lies in the user-friendly technology and comfort features integrated into the design.For stops classified as Primary Shelters (serving over 750 passengers daily), the RTA provides top-tier amenities:The RTA categorizes all 762 shelters into four tiers based on passenger volume to ensure appropriate amenity levels at every stop:In a move showcasing Dubai's focus on future technology, the RTA is also exploring the use of 3D printing technology for the construction of some shelters on a trial basis, blending functionality with cutting-edge innovation.H.E. Mattar Al Tayer, Director General and Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors of the RTA, emphasized the project's greater role, stating: “The new shelters represent a pivotal step in RTA's efforts to develop an integrated urban environment that encourages residents and visitors to use public transport, improves quality of life, and promotes comfort and well-being.”He added that ensuring the shelters combine modern design with services that guarantee a better mobility experience is key to reinforcing public confidence in the network and supporting long-term sustainability objectives, including emissions reduction.The initiative aligns with Dubai’s broader vision for inclusive urban development. The design of every new shelter is fully compliant with the Dubai Universal Design Code, ensuring complete accessibility for all community members. This focus includes dedicated, comfortable spaces specifically tailored for wheelchair users (People of Determination).This commitment to inclusivity supports the ""My Community … A City for Everyone"" initiative, launched by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai.",Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has completed 595 new public bus passenger shelters across key locations.

One step renewal

Citizen driven design

Faster and efficient

Part of zero bureaucracy





In a major step towards seamless government services, the UAE has introduced a unified system that allows Emirati citizens to renew their passports and Emirates ID cards in a single, integrated process. The move, part of the “Zero Bureaucracy” initiative, promises to cut processing times, reduce administrative hurdles, and transform the way citizens manage key identity documents.The Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has launched a smart service enabling citizens to renew both passports and Emirates ID cards together. Previously, individuals had to complete separate applications for each document, navigate different forms, and make multiple payments. The new system consolidates all these steps into one seamless process via the UAEICP smart application.Citizens whose passports have expired and whose Emirates ID is due to expire within six months will now see an option to conveniently renew both documents on a single page within the app. The platform also allows users to easily update personal information and photographs without needing to re-enter data multiple times.The integrated renewal service directly addresses public concerns identified during the “Zero Bureaucracy Expo.” Many residents expressed frustration over managing different expiration dates for passports and ID cards, which often caused administrative confusion. By synchronizing the renewal process, the government ensures that citizens no longer have staggered expirations, simplifying document management.Officials highlighted that the system’s development was shaped by citizen input, evolving from a simple service improvement into a comprehensive smart solution. This reflects a broader commitment to responsive governance, where services are designed to meet the real needs of the public.The new unified platform is expected to cut processing times by at least 50 per cent while reducing inquiries and customer calls by around 40 per cent. It supports the national goal of simplifying procedures, improving government responsiveness, and delivering faster, more integrated services.By centralizing the management of all passports and identity documents for an entire family, the application represents a major leap forward in digital government services. The initiative prioritizes efficiency, quality, and tangible impact, leveraging technology and best practices to make citizens’ lives easier with minimal effort.This development forms part of the second phase of the Zero Government Bureaucracy (ZGB) Programme, launched in June by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai. The program aims to establish a world-leading model for government services, emphasizing proactive, user friendly, and fully integrated digital solutions.The unified passport and Emirates ID renewal service exemplifies the UAE government’s ongoing commitment to eliminating unnecessary administrative hurdles and creating a modern, citizen-centric public service environment.","UAE has introduced a unified system that allows Emirati citizens to renew their passports and Emirates ID cards in a single, integrated process.

Marking 12 years of their strategic use of supercars, the Ministry of Interior confirmed the addition will be deployed in major tourist attractions like the Burj Khalifa to boost visibility, assist visitors, and underscore Dubai's commitment to security, innovation, and high-end excellence.Dubai Police has redefined luxury law enforcement once again by adding a highly customized Ferrari Purosangue Mansory to its world-famous fleet. This new patrol car is not just a high-performance vehicle; it is a global rarity, being one of only seven customized units of its kind in the entire world.The vehicle was specially modified by the German tuning house Mansory, giving it an aggressive yet sophisticated look perfectly suited for the streets of Dubai. The custom upgrades include a full carbon-fibre exterior kit, a sporty front bumper, a prominent rear wing, and custom forged FC.5 wheels.Inside, the cabin features a bespoke interior with premium leather and carbon-fibre trims, reflecting the city’s commitment to high-end excellence.The car’s performance is as impressive as its looks. This machine is powered by a massive 6.5-litre V12 engine, which produces an incredible 755 horsepower and 730Nm of torque. This power allows the patrol car to rocket from 0 to 100km/h in a mere 3.1 seconds and reach a top speed of 320km/h.The unveiling of the customized Ferrari took place at an anniversary event held in front of the iconic Emirates Towers. This celebration marked a significant milestone: 12 years of the Dubai Police’s luxury patrol fleet.The concept of using supercars for police patrols began in 2013 with the introduction of a Lamborghini, quickly turning the fleet into an international symbol of Dubai's innovative approach to security. Today, the luxury fleet has grown to an impressive 56 high-performance vehicles.The strategic purpose of these vehicles, including the new Ferrari, is not chase or speed, but enhanced visibility and global branding.Brigadier Saeed Al Hajri, Director of the General Department of Criminal Investigation, confirmed that the fleet reflects Dubai Police's commitment to innovation and service excellence. He stated that the new patrol will operate across major tourist hubs to assist visitors and strengthen community engagement.The luxury patrols are mobile service units, ensuring a highly visible and approachable presence where the police force can interact directly with residents and millions of visitors.The new Ferrari Purosangue Mansory will be immediately deployed in key tourist zones, including the Burj Khalifa, Mohammed bin Rashid Boulevard, and Jumeirah Beach Residence (JBR). By positioning these eye-catching cars in high-traffic areas, the police aim to bolster the sense of safety and showcase Dubai’s modern image.The fleet’s community role extends far beyond patrolling. Lieutenant Colonel Muhammad Abdulrahman noted that the patrol cars have participated in 1,184 events over the last three years. Crucially, they are also used to engage with the public on a personal level, having helped fulfil 49 wishes for children between 2023 and 2025, reinforcing the police’s focus on community happiness and positive interaction.","Dubai Police has redefined luxury law enforcement once again by adding a highly customized Ferrari Purosangue Mansory to its world-famous fleet. This new patrol car is not just a high-performance vehicle; it is a global rarity, being one of only seven customized units of its kind in the entire world. The car’s performance is as impressive as its looks, powered by a massive 6.5-litre V12 engine, which produces an incredible 755 horsepower and 730Nm of torque.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125790604,imgsize-99106,width-400,resizemode-4/ferrari.jpg"

Nik Pash, who drew massive flak after he made an unsavory comment, ""Imagine the smell,"" on a photo of Indian coders, has apparently been removed from the company Cline.After the massive backlash, Nik Pash seems to have been withdrawn from the company as users share Cline company's founder Saoud Rizwan tweet, which has been deleted now, about firing the Company's AI Head .In a statement posted on X, Rizwan acknowledged that while he did not believe the executive’s original tweet was intentionally offensive, the refusal to apologise in its aftermath “does not reflect my position or Cline’s.”“He is no longer with Cline,” the CEO said, adding that the company recognised the hurt caused by the episode and that it “deserves acknowledgment and empathy.”Rizwan also condemned the harassment the former executive has reportedly faced since the controversy erupted. “While I disagreed with how he responded, nobody deserves the threats and abuse he’s received. Please leave him and his family in peace,” he wrote.The CEO ended his message with a direct apology: “To everyone who was hurt by this — I am sorry.”Earlier, Nik Pash issued a statement asserting that he would not apologize for making a 'harmless joke'.He said he had been to four hackathons this year and all of them smelled bad.His 'imagine the smell' comment to a jampacked hackathon photo of xAi was in the context of that but he said he received even death threats as some people on social media made it look like a racist comment.Pash also tagged Elon Musk and said X did not become the place that he wanted it to be -- to let people make jokes and have fun in peace. Pash attacked Indian-origin techie Deedy Das for adding fuel to the fire.The photo, which triggered the massive controversy, was posted by X user Taylor. ""A full audience of hardcore builders and engineers at the @xai hackathon!"" she wrote. The photo indeed showed a room full of men and women and many of them were visibly of Indian origin. As Pash commented, 'imagine the smell', it was seen as a jibe at Indians, as calling Indians smelly has become a part of regular anti-India/anti-South Asia hatred on social media.","Nik Pash, who drew massive flak after he made an unsavory comment, ""Imagine the smell,"" on a photo of Indian coders, has apparently been removed from the company Cline.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Pensioners play a vital role in the social fabric of our society, and their financial security is paramount. To ensure continued access to pension benefits, annual life certificate submissions are mandatory for all pensioners. This process, which verifies the pensioner's living status, has been streamlined through various online and offline methods. With the recent initiatives to promote digital submissions, pensioners can conveniently fulfil this requirement and maintain their financial support.The requirement for pensioners to submit their jeevan pramaan patra is a critical process in ensuring the integrity and sustainability of pension funds. By providing multiple submission methods—both online and offline—the government is making it easier for pensioners to comply with this requirement. The ongoing digital campaigns further illustrate the government’s commitment to enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of pension services, ensuring that pensioners receive their benefits without unnecessary delays.The submission window for life certificates opened on November 1 for pensioners under the age of 80. This is part of an annual cycle during which pensioners must reaffirm their eligibility for pension disbursement. The deadline for submitting the life certificate is November 30. If the certificate is not submitted by this deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting in December. This requirement also applies to super senior citizens (aged 80 and above), who were allowed to submit their certificates starting on October 1, with the same November 30 deadline.Pensioners can submit their life certificates through several methods, accommodating various preferences and technological capabilities. Here are the options available:For those choosing to submit their life certificates online through the Jeevan Pramaan Portal, the following steps are involved:For pensioners opting for offline submission, the process is straightforward:If pensioners fail to submit their life certificates by the stipulated deadline, their pension payments will be halted starting the following month.

This campaign runs from November 1 to November 30, covering 800 cities and districts. The campaign aims to promote the use of digital platforms for certificate submission, ensuring greater accessibility for pensioners.On the first day of this campaign, over 1.8 lakh pensioners successfully generated their digital life certificates, highlighting the growing adoption of technology among pensioners. This indicates a positive trend towards digitalization and the effective use of biometric authentication methods.A life certificate is an official document that verifies a pensioner's living status, required annually to continue receiving pension benefits.All pensioners, including family pensioners, must submit a life certificate to maintain their pension payments.Pensioners under 80 must submit their life certificate between November 1 and November 30 each year.

This method is particularly beneficial for those with mobility issues.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114942014,imgsize-53514,width-400,resizemode-4/114942014.jpg"
Meet Charlie Javice: Woman who scammed JP Morgan for $175M — but the bank is paying her $142M legal bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meet-charlie-javice-woman-who-scammed-jp-morgan-for-175m-but-the-bank-is-paying-her-142m-legal-bills/articleshow/125369591.cms,"How a startup deal turned into a massive fraud

A conviction that didn’t stop the bills

The controversial expenses

Why JPMorgan cannot simply stop paying

Charlie Javice’s story sounds almost too bizarre to be real: a young fintech founder who tricked JPMorgan into buying her startup for $175 million, ended up convicted of fraud, and is now serving a prison sentence, yet the same company she scammed is still paying more than $142 million for her legal bills, including questionable expenses like luxury hotel upgrades and “cellulite butter. ”Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid. When JPMorgan considered acquiring the startup in 2021, she reportedly presented the bank with millions of supposed student user accounts. Prosecutors later revealed that these numbers had been fabricated, with Javice allegedly hiring a data scientist to generate fake profiles to inflate Frank’s value.JPMorgan completed the acquisition believing Frank had more than four million users, only to discover after the deal that the platform had a tiny fraction of that. The bank alerted authorities, and by 2023 Javice was arrested on federal fraud charges.In March 2025, Javice was convicted of multiple fraud counts and sentenced to more than seven years in prison. But here’s where the story takes an unusual twist: despite defrauding the bank, she is still allowed to bill JPMorgan for her legal defence because of an indemnification clause included in the acquisition agreement.This contractual protection, which is common in startup buyouts, requires JPMorgan to cover certain legal costs for former executives of Frank.As a result, the bank has already paid over $142 million in defence expenses for Javice and her former colleague Olivier Amar.The clause itself is a standard feature in mergers, designed to protect executives from being financially ruined by lawsuits connected to their time at the company. In normal situations, it is meant to ensure fairness and prevent frivolous legal targeting after an acquisition. But in this case, it has trapped JPMorgan in a bizarre obligation: they must keep funding the defence of someone who defrauded them.Had the bank conducted even a simple, early-stage verification of Frank’s user data—such as requesting direct access to the platform’s actual customer records or running a basic audit—this entire dispute could have been avoided. Instead, delayed due diligence and overconfidence in the startup’s claims set the stage for a costly legal mess that continues years after the fraud was uncovered.JPMorgan’s frustration has grown as the legal bills have ballooned. The bank claims the expenses submitted include personal items such as cellulite butter, first-class travel upgrades, and hotel luxuries. Its lawyers argue that the billing records contain “extreme abuses,” including claims for work hours that seem physically impossible.Javice’s spokesperson denies that she personally submitted these questionable charges, stating that her legal team is responsible for all billing decisions.Even though Javice has already been convicted, she is now appealing her case, and the indemnification clause means the bank must continue paying her legal fees unless a court orders otherwise. JPMorgan is currently trying to convince a Delaware judge to halt these payments, arguing that the system is being misused.The saga has become a major lesson in the risks of fast-paced startup acquisitions. JPMorgan’s failure to properly verify Frank’s user base before buying the company has left it entangled in one of the most embarrassing and expensive due diligence failures in recent corporate history.","Charlie Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid.

"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on why despite being the CEO of world's most-valuable company, sense of uncertainty and insecurity doesn't leave him",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-on-why-despite-being-the-ceo-of-worlds-most-valuable-company-sense-of-uncertainty-and-insecurity-doesnt-leave-him/articleshow/125883149.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, despite leading his company to a $5 trillion valuation, lives in constant anxiety, a fear rooted in a near-bankruptcy experience. Recent reports of Meta potentially buying Google's AI chips have caused a $250 billion market value drop, validating Huang's long-held belief that the company is always '30 days from going out of business'.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

A near-death experience that shaped Huang’s three decades of paranoia

Why Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang 's fears suddenly look prophetic





Despite leading Nvidia to become the first company ever to hit a $5 trillion valuation, CEO Jensen Huang admits he operates in constant anxiety, working every single day including holidays. His fears may be justified—this week alone, Nvidia lost $250 billion in market value after reports emerged that Meta is in advanced talks to buy billions worth of competing chips from Google , threatening the chipmaker's decade-long dominance in AI hardware.""The phrase '30 days from going out of business'—I've used for 33 years,"" Huang revealed on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. ""The feeling doesn't change. The sense of vulnerability, the sense of uncertainty, the sense of insecurity—it doesn't leave you.""Huang's anxiety isn't unfounded paranoia—it's scar tissue from survival. In the mid-1990s, Nvidia discovered fatal flaws in its first graphics chip while developing technology for Sega's gaming console. With funds evaporating, Huang flew to Japan for an excruciating conversation: he told Sega's CEO the product wouldn't work and the deal must end, but simultaneously begged for the final $5 million payment to prevent bankruptcy.Remarkably, Sega converted it into an investment, giving Nvidia the lifeline that eventually built a trillion-dollar empire.That near-collapse experience now fuels Huang's relentless schedule. He wakes at 4 a.m. daily to read ""several thousand emails,"" works seven days a week without exception—""including Thanksgiving, Christmas""—and admits he's ""always in a state of anxiety."" His motivation? ""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed. Failure drives me more than greed.""Huang's paranoia might be wisdom. Nvidia made the rare move of issuing a public defense after The Information reported that Meta—planning up to $72 billion in AI spending this year—is negotiating massive purchases of Google's tensor processing units (TPUs). The news triggered a 6% stock plunge, erasing roughly $250 billion in value, while Alphabet shares surged 4%.""Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry—it's the only platform that runs every AI model,"" the company declared on X, breaking its usual silence on competitors. But Google's latest Gemini 3 AI model, trained entirely on TPUs rather than Nvidia chips, is being hailed by industry leaders as potentially superior. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff publicly announced he's switching from ChatGPT after three years, calling Gemini 3 the better product.The threat is existential to Nvidia's 90% market share in AI accelerators. If Google captures even a fraction of the hundreds of billions being spent on AI processors—particularly from customers like Meta—it would represent the first serious crack in Nvidia's dominance.Huang's work ethic has infected his family: both his children, Madison and Spencer, now in their thirties, work at Nvidia after joining as interns in 2020 and 2022. ""Now we have three people working every day,"" Huang said.For a CEO who never stopped running scared despite building a $4.5-trillion empire, the market turmoil caused by Google likely only confirmed what he's believed for 33 years: you're always 30 days from going out of business.","Jensen Huang is the CEO of Nvidia, the first company ever to hit a $5 trillion valuation.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai hints at building data centres in space; Elon Musk replies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-hints-at-building-data-centres-in-space-elon-musk-replies/articleshow/125864477.cms,"



Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently hinted at building data centres in space. In an interview with Fox News, Pichai said that the company is working on quantum computing, adding “in that spirit, one of our moon shots is to, how do we one day have data centers in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun”.Sundar Pichai’s video from the interview was shared by X (formerly Twitter) user - Bourbon Capital in an online post. It caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk who replied to the post with a single word. “Interesting”, Musk wrote.“At Google, we are always proud of taking moon shots,” Pichai said, adding “... Waymo … has been over a decade in the making.”“We're working on quantum computing, in that spirit, one of our moon shots is to, how do we one day have data centers in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun,” he continued.Pichai further said that the company wants to “put these data centers in space closer to the sun”, and will take “first step in 2027”.“We'll send tiny racks of machines and have them in satellites, test them out, and then start scaling from there. But there's no doubt to me that a decade or so away will be viewing it as a more normal way to build data centers,” Sundar Pichai said in the interview.Notably, this echoes Musk's November 2025 announcements that SpaceX will pioneer orbital data centers using next-gen Starlink satellites, positioning them as the lowest-cost AI compute option within five years.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company is working on quantum computing.

Five key things people asked Copilot in 2025

1. Health dominates mobile use

2. Programming and gaming

3. February witnessed

Valentine’s Day

spike

4. Late-night philosophy and religion debates

5. Rise of personal advice seeking





Microsoft’s AI division (MAI) has released an analysis of how people used its AI chatbot, Copilot, in 2025. The team revealed its top 5 findings days after other tech giants like YouTube, Instagram and Spotify, released a recap of users’ activities in the past year. Microsoft's report says that it analysed 37.5 million anonymized conversations which showed that Copilot is functioning as a “trusted advisor,” with people asking the chatbot about health to late-night philosophical debates related to religion and philosophy.According to the MAI report, health-related topics were the most dominant category across the entire year, specifically when users accessed Copilot on their mobile devices. The data suggests users consistently rely on Copilot for tracking wellness, searching for health tips and managing daily routines.Highlighting data from August, the usage report showed an overlap between two distinct interests: programming and gaming. Users were equally likely to engage in coding projects as they were to explore games. However, this engagement was split across the calendar: users tended to code during the week and play games during the weekends.Copilot AI usage on Valentine’s Day topics increased during February as the month witnessed a significant spike in activity because users relied on Copilot for help navigating a major calendar event. The queries were concentrated around preparing for Valentine’s Day and seeking support regarding relationships.Searches related to “Religion and Philosophy” notably rose during the early hours of the morning, indicating users often turn to the AI for bigger, late-night questions. On the contrary, travel conversations peaked most often during commuting hours.Copilot saw a clear rise in users seeking advice, particularly on personal topics. This trend includes users seeking guidance on navigating relationships and making life decisions.","Microsoft's AI division (MAI) has released an analysis of how people used its AI chatbot, Copilot, in 2025.

These systems ensure we maximise our existing global data centre footprint for scale while promoting efficient heat dissipation and optimising power delivery to meet the demands of AI and hyperscale systems.”

""there's a trade-off""

""address some of the public concerns with water consumption, because water is something people can really see,""

“These companies are profit-driven; they weigh in the water cost, the energy cost, and also the publicity cost,”

""carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste""

""We've also announced a zero water cooling design for our next-generation data centres and breakthroughs in on-chip cooling,""

What the Nvidia employee said about Blackwell installation

“On-site support for this activity was a necessity. Many hours were spent creating the validation process documentation as well as vetting the steps worked and made sense to those less familiar with how cluster and system validation are usually performed,”

“required a lot more solidification than what was performed before arrival.""

""has good quality""

“deliver exceptional performance, reliability, and energy efficiency for a wide variety of computing applications.”

“Our customers, including Microsoft, have successfully deployed hundreds of thousands of Blackwell GB200 and GB300 NVL72 systems to meet the world's growing need for artificial intelligence,”





An Nvidia employee may not be satisfied with Microsoft's cooling system for its Blackwell GPUs. In an internal email, the Nvidia employee who wishes to remain anonymous claimed that at one of the data centre facilities, Microsoft's cooling approach wasThis comes as the chip giant works to deploy its powerful new GPUs. The employee, who is a part of the Nvidia Infrastructure Specialists (NVIS) team, sent the memo to describe a Blackwell installation intended for OpenAI, which Microsoft supports as its cloud partner.According to Shaolei Ren, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, even though servers use liquid cooling, data centres still rely on a second, building-wide system to remove heat from the facility. Ren, who researches data centre resource use, said the Nvidia employee was likely referring to a building-level cooling system that uses air instead of water.he highlighted. A Microsoft spokesperson’s explanation of the company’s cooling system also aligned with Ren’s two-step description.In a statement to Business Insider, a Microsoft spokesperson said:As AI infrastructure grows, the energy and water demands of data-centre cooling have become major points of debate worldwide, leading to resistance in some areas where new centres are planned.Ren explained that data centres may rely on air cooling, water cooling, or a hybrid approach at the building level, and thatbetween the resources used.Air cooling consumes more energy, but canRen noted.Ren added.Meanwhile, Microsoft said that it aims to beby 2030.the company’s spokesperson said.The setup in question involves two GB200 NVL72 racks, each containing 72 Nvidia GPUs, utilising Microsoft’s liquid-cooling technology to manage the intense heat generated by the closely packed chips that power surging demand for AI model training and operation.The internal email from the Nvidia staffer outlined several logistical issues that arose during the Blackwell installation earlier this year, noting that such challenges are common when rolling out new data centre hardware.the Nvidia employee wrote.The employee also noted that the handover procedures between Nvidia and MicrosoftDespite these hurdles, the memo indicated that the quality of Blackwell’s production hardware had improved over earlier test units.According to the email, the GB200 NVL72 production hardwarecompared to the previously sent qualified samples, and both racks achieved a 100% pass rate on specific compute performance tests.In a statement to Business Insider, an Nvidia spokesperson said that its Blackwell systemsthe Nvidia spokesperson added.Nvidia introduced its latest Blackwell GPUs in 2024. During its launch, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang claimed that these new chips are about twice as powerful as the previous generation Hopper chips. The GB200 belongs to the first group of Blackwell chips, while the newer GB300 models are already out.","An Nvidia employee may not be satisfied with Microsoft's cooling system for its Blackwell GPUs.

102-year-old Disney tells 27-year-old Google ‘You are old’ and so we have to …,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/102-year-old-disney-tells-27-year-old-google-you-are-old-and-so-we-have-to-/articleshow/125934386.cms,"Disney wants Google to stop infringing on its copyrighted works







Disney has secured a licensing partnership with OpenAI, which includes a $1 billion investment and access to Disney’s iconic characters. Company CEO Bob Iger stated the deal is designed to help the 102-year-old entertainment giant into new media and harness AI to attract younger audiences for engagement. However, this is in contrast to Disney’s legal action against Google as the company sent a ‘Cease-and-Desist’ letter to the search giant, alleging that Google's AI models infringe Disney's copyright on a “massive scale”. The company also alleged that using this data, the company’s AI models generated content resembling characters from franchises like Frozen, Deadpool and Star WarsSpeaking on CNBC about the deal with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Iger described the partnership as a way for Disney to participate in rapid technological development rather than being disrupted by it.“It gives us an opportunity, really, to play a part in what is really a breathtaking, breathtaking growth in essentially AI and new forms of media and entertainment,” Iger said. As per the deal, Disney wants to integrate user-generated content onto its Disney+ streaming platform.Disney initially plans to feature select videos created using OpenAI's Sora platform on Disney+ to boost engagement, particularly with younger users.However, the ultimate goal is to enable Disney+ users to create such AI-generated videos within the streaming platform itself.Meanwhile, Altman noted that demand for Disney characters on OpenAI's products is “off the charts” and suggested the deal will enable people to place themselves in a “Star Wars” lightsaber scene.However, Disney’s notice demands Google must stop using copyrighted material to train its AI models – implying that even as Disney embraces AI through its OpenAI partnership, the company is taking an aggressive stance against what it views as unauthorised exploitation of its intellectual property by Google.“Google is intentionally amplifying the scope of its infringement, by making its infringing AI Services available across so many channels to so many consumers, flooding the market with infringing works, and reaping enormous profits and other value from its unlawful, harmful, and damaging exploitation of Disney’s copyrighted works,” says the letter from David Singer, the Jenner & Block attorney representing Disney.“Google operates as a virtual vending machine, capable of reproducing, rendering, and distributing copies of Disney’s valuable library of copyrighted characters and other works on a mass scale. And compounding Google’s blatant infringement, many of the infringing images generated by Google’s AI Services are branded with Google’s Gemini logo, falsely implying that Google’s exploitation of Disney’s intellectual property is authorized and endorsed by Disney,” adds the letter.Google, however, refuted saying, “We have a longstanding and mutually beneficial relationship with Disney, and will continue to engage with them. More generally, we use public data from the open web to build our AI and have built additional innovative copyright controls like Google-extended and Content ID for YouTube, which give sites and copyright holders control over their content.”","Disney has secured a licensing partnership with OpenAI, which includes a $1 billion investment and access to Disney’s iconic characters.
