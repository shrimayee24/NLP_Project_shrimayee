India has a river that flows backwards: Know which river it is,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/travel/india-has-a-river-that-flows-backwards-know-which-river-it-is/articleshow/126525975.cms,"The Narmada river flows in the opposite direction and here’s why

The origin of the Narmada River

The reason why the Narmada flow westwards

What landscapes does the river support

Dams and projects that lie on the river

Natural sites found along the Narmada

Narmada and its importance for faith and culture

India’s river systems are usually described as following a clear pattern. Most major rivers rise in the Himalayas or the central highlands and travel eastward to the Bay of Bengal, a rule taught early in geography lessons and seldom challenged. Yet one notable river defies this logic. Flowing westward across the subcontinent, it reshapes landscapes, livelihoods, and belief systems along its course. Far from obscure or insignificant, this river is long, deeply revered, and extensively studied, though its direction often surprises first-time learners. The Narmada stands apart not for its size or speed alone, but because its westward journey is dictated by geology rather than convention. This geological defiance has influenced settlement patterns, pilgrimage routes, dam construction, ecological debates, and identities for centuries across western India.The Narmada is the river that flows west instead of east. It is the fifth-longest river in India, spanning around 1,310 kilometres. The Narmada River does not empty into the Bay of Bengal like the Ganga or Godavari do. It travels steadily westward from its source until it eventually reaches the Arabian Sea.The Tapi is another prominent example of the few big Indian rivers that follow this path. The idea that the Narmada runs ""backwards"" originates from the fact that the majority of the region's rivers flow in the opposite direction, eastward.The Narmada River begins near Amarkantak in Madhya Pradesh. The place is forested and used as a pilgrimage spot. From here, the river starts to travel west. It travels through Madhya Pradesh, briefly spans Maharashtra, and then enters Gujarat. Its journey concludes in Bharuch, when it reaches the Arabian Sea. The river's character changes as it travels. In some places, it cuts through hills and small valleys, while in others, it widens out and slows. The upper stretches feel solitary, while the lower ones feel settled. Dams, towns, temples, agriculture, and monsoon patterns all have an impact on the livelihoods, ecosystems, and cultural rhythms of millions of people.Geology shapes the Narmada's flow direction. It flows across a rift valley caused by previous tectonic action. The valley slopes east to west. Water follows the slope. The Vindhya Range sits to the north of the basin, while the Satpura Range extends to the south. Because the river passes through this gap, it behaves differently than many others. It does not form a wide delta. Instead, it creates an estuary where it joins the sea.The Narmada basin covers varied terrain. While the upper areas are hilly and forested, with less people living nearby, the land becomes flatter and more open when you go further west. These plains are fertile. Farming depends heavily on the river here. Crops such as wheat, pulses, and cotton are common. The river also supplies drinking water. Over time, canals and reservoirs have extended its reach. Towns and cities along the river rely on it in quiet, everyday ways.Several large dams have been built along the Narmada. The Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat is the most widely known. Others include the Indira Sagar Dam and the Omkareshwar Dam in Madhya Pradesh. These projects generate electricity and supply water for farming and households. They have also changed how the river flows. Over the years, they have been linked to debates about land, displacement, and environmental impact. These discussions continue.The river is also associated with well-known natural features. Near Jabalpur, it passes between tall marble cliffs known as the Marble Rocks. Close by, there is Dhuandhar Falls that send water crashing down in a thick spray, especially during the monsoon. Although these places are not vast, they leave an impression. The river here feels contained. The sound carries. The landscape holds it in place.For numerous individuals, the Narmada signifies more than merely a river. Temples in Maheshwar, Omkareshwar, and Amarkantak attract pilgrims year-round. Some individuals undertake the Narmada Parikrama, an extensive pilgrimage along its banks. The river is regarded as a living entity. Its trajectory has remained consistent across generations. Throughout its extent, faith, establishment, and customary practices persist in expanding around it.","The Narmada is the fifth-longest river in India, spanning around 1,310 kilometres.

The world’s largest beaver dam is so big that you can see it from space,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/the-worlds-largest-beaver-dam-is-so-big-that-you-can-see-it-from-space/articleshow/126520430.cms,"AI-generated

A beaver dam hidden in Canada is clearly visible from space

The actual size of the beaver dam is impressive

This beaver dam was discovered from space

Why beavers build on this scale

What the dam means for the wider park





Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada, which includes northern Alberta and parts of the Northwest Territories, is home to the largest beaver dam ever documented. The structure is located deep within the park, far from roads, towns, and established paths, making it inaccessible by foot. It is so large that it can be seen in satellite photographs from orbit. The dam is approximately 775 metres long at its front edge and spans an area of around 70,000 square metres, keeping back a substantial volume of water. It was initially discovered in 2007 using satellite imaging rather than terrestrial exploration. Further investigation revealed that the dam did not exist before 1980, implying that it was developed over several decades by multiple generations of beavers operating in the same spot.Wood Buffalo National Park spans northern Alberta and parts of the Northwest Territories. It is Canada's largest national park and among the world's largest protected places. The beaver dam is located deep within it, far from roads, cities, and recognised trails.Walking to the place would take several days. The terrain is challenging and slow. Wetlands extend over large distances. Muskeg collapses under weight.The boreal forest closes in densely. Most people who saw the dam up close did not walk there. They arrived on private sightseeing planes, looking down rather than approaching on the ground.According to Parks Canada , from end to end, the front of the dam measures roughly 775 metres. That is close to seven football fields laid side by side. The entire perimeter of the dam area approaches 2,000 metres. Its surface area covers about 70,000 square metres.The pond created behind the dam is thought to be around one metre deep. That would place the volume of water at roughly 70,000 cubic metres. Another way to see it is through scale. A standard dump truck carries about 10 cubic yards. By that measure, the dam holds back the equivalent of more than 90,000 dump trucks of water. Seen as ice, it would fill around 1,600 hockey rinks.According to BBC Wildlife , no explorer stumbled across this dam by chance. No ranger logged it during patrol. It was first noticed in 2007, not on the ground, but in satellite imagery. The structure was large enough to be visible from space.Further images, including those provided by NASA, showed that the dam did not exist before 1980. That suggests it could be up to 45 years old. Over that time, it grew slowly, piece by piece, shaped by water flow and repeated work rather than a single effort. The location helped keep it hidden. With no nearby access routes, there was little reason for people to pass through.Beavers are often described as ecosystem engineers. They change landscapes by design, even if that design follows instinct rather than a plan. By felling trees and packing wood, mud, stones, and vegetation together, they redirect water and create ponds.In the case of this dam, multiple generations of beavers worked on the same structure. Each added material where it was needed. Over time, the dam expanded and strengthened, holding back runoff from the Birch Mountains at the southern edge of the park. The result is not just a barrier but an entire water system shaped by animals rather than machines.Wood Buffalo National Park is known for more than its size. It supports wood bison, whooping cranes, and the Peace Athabasca Delta, one of the largest inland freshwater deltas in the world. The beaver dam fits quietly into that setting.It supports wetlands, slows water movement, and creates habitat for other species. It does not draw crowds or require fences. It simply exists, doing its work out of sight. Even now, most people will never see it directly. The dam remains where it was built, surrounded by forest and water, changing its corner of the park a little at a time.","The beaver dam is located in Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada.

"‘Purpose of task vs. job’: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang explains why AI will change jobs, not eliminate them",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/purpose-of-task-vs-job-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-explains-why-ai-will-change-jobs-not-eliminate-them/articleshow/127138253.cms,"Jensen Huang

Jensen Huang explains why AI changes tasks, not the purpose of jobs

AI-Powered Future: Next Gen Careers You Should Watch

AI did not replace radiologists it made them more in demand

AI helps Jensen Huang type less, but think more

Software engineering and hiring growth

Legal and service industries adapt

Redesigning work, not removing it

A shift in how work is done





People are getting more and more worried about losing their jobs as AI becomes more common in the workplace. Many workers are worried that machines could completely take over human jobs, from offices to hospitals. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, thinks this fear misses an important point. Speaking on the No Priors podcast, Huang offered a calm and practical view of how AI is actually changing the workplace. He says that AI is not taking away the purpose of jobs. It's not changing the jobs themselves; it's changing how some parts of them are done. AI takes care of boring or time-consuming tasks so that people can focus on things that need human judgment, experience, and responsibility. Huang's argument is based on examples from the real world in healthcare, technology, law, and even the service industry.One of the main things Jensen Huang talked about was the difference between tasks and goals. People do tasks every day, like typing reports, looking over documents, or scanning pictures. Purpose is the reason the job exists in the first place.Huang explained that AI is very good at handling tasks, especially those that are repetitive or rule-based.However, it does not replace the core purpose of a role. In many cases, removing these smaller tasks allows professionals to do their jobs better and on a larger scale.Radiology is often cited as a field that AI would disrupt or shrink. Years ago, some experts predicted that automated image analysis would reduce the need for radiologists. Huang pointed out that the opposite has happened.Recent data shows that in 2025, diagnostic radiology residency programs offered 1,208 positions, a 4 percent increase compared to the previous year. Radiology has also become the second-highest-paid medical speciality, with average incomes reaching $520,000. This marks a 48 percent increase since 2015.AI now helps radiologists read scans faster and more accurately. But the core responsibility, diagnosing disease and guiding treatment, still depends on human expertise. Because hospitals can now process more cases, they earn more revenue and hire more specialists.Huang used his own role to explain the idea further. He said much of his day is spent typing, reviewing information, and communicating. AI tools that help automate writing or summarising tasks save him time.However, he made it clear that this has not reduced his workload. Instead, it allows him to handle more responsibilities. AI takes away the stress of smaller tasks, which helps him focus on making decisions, planning, and leading.AI is also having a big effect on software development. AI tools can now write code, find bugs, and speed up the development process. Some assume this means fewer engineers are needed.Huang rejected this view. At Nvidia, the company continues to hire engineers even as AI tools become more capable. Faster development means more projects can be taken on. That, in turn, creates demand for skilled people who can design systems, solve problems, and guide long-term technical direction.The legal profession is also changing. AI can quickly review documents and search through large volumes of data. Still, lawyers remain essential for protecting clients, resolving disputes, and applying judgment in complex situations.Huang also spoke about service jobs, such as restaurants. Even if AI takes over tasks like order-taking or delivery, the purpose of the job remains unchanged. The goal is still to make customers happy. People who work adapt by focusing more on personal interaction, problem-solving, and the quality of service.Huang's main point is that AI doesn't take jobs away; it changes the way people do them. The most affected are jobs that require you to do the same things over and over. Jobs that require results, care, creativity, and responsibility still need people.AI is a tool that helps workers get more done. It helps businesses serve more customers, patients, or users by making them more productive, which usually means they hire more people.AI is changing how work is done instead of taking jobs away. It clears up bottlenecks, makes everyday tasks go faster, and gives professionals more time to focus on what's really important. Huang says that in the future, work won't be about fighting AI. Instead, it will be about figuring out how to use it to get better results while keeping people at the center.","Jensen Huang explains why AI changes tasks, not the purpose of jobs.

Gym syndicate targeted Hindu women for religious conversion in UP; GRP head constable among 6 arrested,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/gym-syndicate-targeted-30-hindus-women-for-religious-conversion/articleshow/127324194.cms,"Lucknow Headlines Today — The Biggest Updates You Need to Know.







LUCKNOW: Police investigation into the gym syndicate that ran an illegal religious conversion and AI-backed blackmail racket in Mirzapur has revealed that the gang targeted as many as 30 women. The gang was busted after two victims blew the lid off.Most of the victims were Hindu women who had joined the chain of five gyms for physical training. The gang targeted women by creating their AI-generated obscene videos and used them to blackmail and pressure them for religious conversion. The racket had been running since 2021, said police.Six accused, including a GRP head constable Irshad Khan, 40, have been arrested.The other five accused include gym owners and trainers — Mohammad Sheikh Ali Alam, 31, Faizal Khan, 34, Zaheer, 32, Shadab, 36, and Farid Ahmed, 28.Obscene AI-edited videos and photos recovered from the mobiles of the accused are a key evidence in the case, said police. The prime accused, gym owner Farid Ahmed, was arrested in an encounter after allegedly opening fire on a police team during a raid.SP/DIG Mirzapur, Somen Barma, told TOI that the racket came to light after two young women lodged separate complaints earlier this month, alleging that they were trapped, blackmailed, and pressured to change their religion using AI-generated obscene videos.Barma said the accused used to befriend women who joined their gyms and gradually gained access to their personal photographs and videos.""These were then morphed using AI tools to create explicit and obscene content. The victims were subsequently threatened with circulation of these AI-edited videos on social media unless they complied with the gang's demands, which included sexual exploitation and coercion to convert religion,"" Barma added.""Recovered mobiles contain dozens of AI-generated obscene videos and chats,"" said another senior officer, adding that most of the accused are Class dropouts.GRP head constable Irshad Khan, posted in Bhadohi, allegedly provided logistical support and protection to the syndicate.Investigators said that 4 of the 5 gyms — KGN-1.0, KGN-2.0, KGN-3.0, B-Fit, and Iron Fire — were run by 3 brothers and their brother-in-law.Mirzapur DM Pawan Kumar Gangwar has sealed all five gyms under the scanner till Feb 27.Police are trying to trace more and find whether the racket had links beyond Mirzapur. Digital forensics teams are analysing data to determine how widely the AI-generated content was shared and whether similar methods were used in other districts.""This was not just a blackmail case. It was a systematic attempt to exploit women psychologically and socially using technology,"" an officer said, adding that more arrests are likely to be made.Authorities have appealed to women who may have been targeted to come forward, assuring them protection and confidentiality.Police said many victims are married and do not want to report the case fearing social stigma and backlash from their families.","Most of the victims were Hindu women who had joined the chain of five gyms for physical training.

From customer support chats to recommendation engines, from coding tools to medical research, AI is now part of how work gets done efficiently. And according to Bill Gates , the pace of change is about to speed up even more dramatically.In his latest annual letter, The Year Ahead, the Microsoft co-founder lays out a clear message. AI will reshape society, economies, and jobs faster than most people expect. Gates says he remains optimistic about technology, but this time his optimism comes with serious warnings. The benefits are real. So are the risks. And ignoring either would be a grave mistake.Gates has spent decades watching technology alter economies and daily life. In his letter, he says AI is different from past waves of innovation. Not just faster, but broader. He argues that artificial intelligence could affect more parts of society than any previous human-made tool.He points to progress already happening. AI is accelerating disease research, improving climate modelling, and expanding access to digital education.Tasks that once took years can now be completed in months, sometimes weeks. For Gates, this is proof that AI can solve hard problems if used well.But he also stresses that hope alone is not a strategy. Institutions, governments, and workers are not fully prepared for how quickly these changes are arriving. Without planning, the speed of AI adoption could leave many people behind.One of Gates’ biggest concerns is how AI could be misused. As advanced tools become more accessible, the barrier to harmful use drops. He has warned that open-source AI systems could be exploited by bad actors, including non-state groups.In particular, Gates has raised alarms about biological threats. He suggests that AI-assisted misuse could pose risks even greater than naturally occurring pandemics. That is not a casual statement. It reflects a growing fear among researchers that powerful tools, in the wrong hands, could scale harm faster than ever before.Gates argues that global cooperation is essential. Clear rules, oversight, and governance structures are needed. At the same time, he acknowledges the tension. Too many restrictions could slow beneficial innovation. Too little could invite danger. Finding the balance will not be easy.Jobs sit at the centre of Gates’ warning. He says AI makes it possible to produce more goods and services with less human labour. That reality will change how companies hire and how work is valued.Some of this is already visible. In software development, AI tools help programmers write, test, and maintain code faster. Gates notes that developers can now be significantly more productive, which lowers costs and reshapes team structures.He also points to sectors like warehouse operations and phone-based customer service. As AI systems improve, these roles are likely to face pressure. Automation will not arrive all at once, but it will arrive steadily.Gates does not frame this as doom. He frames it as a disruption that needs preparation.Beyond job losses, Bill Gates talks about how work itself might change. If AI boosts productivity enough, shorter workweeks could become possible. The same output, fewer hours. It sounds appealing. But he is careful not to present it as automatic.Whether these gains benefit most people depends on policy choices. Who owns the productivity gains. How companies share them. Without thoughtful decisions, Gates warns that efficiency could concentrate wealth instead of spreading it.This is where governments and institutions matter. AI alone will not deliver fairness. People have to decide what to do with the gains it creates.","Bill Gates says AI will reshape society, economies, and jobs faster than most people expect.

Wordle has moments when instinct takes over and confidence wanes. That wait tends to occur today. The puzzle doesn't rush you, but it also doesn't tolerate taking quick cuts. It's possible for early guesses to appear beneficial before subtly blocking better options. The arrangement is more important than normal, but the letters feel familiar and nearly evident. Flashy risks and smart openings are not appropriate now. It requires self-control and focus, rewarding players who notice what's missing as well as what's there. It makes sense if you have been staring at the grid for longer than you intended. Until the framework aligns, the solution is still elusive. A few well-chosen cues can help bring the word into focus and stabilise the situation.Wordle challenges players to uncover a hidden five-letter word in six attempts. After each guess, tiles change colour to show how close you are.Using this feedback to refine each new guess is the core of the game.If today’s puzzle is proving stubborn, these clues focus on structure rather than spelling. They are intended to guide rather than solve.Reviewing eliminated letters and leaning on common consonants may help reduce the remaining options and bring the solution into view.The answer to Wordle #1682 on January 26, 2026, is:Meaning: A person, animal or event extremely unusual or unlikely, and not like any other of its type.Whether you solved it on your first guess or needed a few clues, Wordle remains a fun way to sharpen your mind every day.

"THIS world’s largest underground city under Cappadocia kept 20,000 people alive without seeing daylight",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/this-worlds-largest-underground-city-under-cappadocia-kept-20000-people-alive-without-seeing-daylight/articleshow/127542217.cms,"Derinkuyu underground city: A buried metropolis that housed 20,000 people



Derinkuyu underground city rediscovered after centuries of silence



How Cappadocia’s geology allowed an underground civilisation



Survival and daily life inside the underground city



How air shafts and wells sustained life in Derinkuyu



Derinkuyu’s legacy beneath Cappadocia today







Above ground, Cappadocia feels utterly otherworldly. Wind-carved fairy chimneys rise dramatically from dusty valleys, their pale pink and honey-coloured rock glowing brilliantly under the warm Turkish sun. Hot-air balloons drift gracefully overhead at dawn, and adventurous hikers trace winding paths through deep canyons shaped by ancient volcanic eruptions. Yet beneath this striking and dramatic landscape lies something even more astonishing. More than 85 metres below the surface, an entire underground city once secretly sheltered thousands of people, hidden from view and largely forgotten for many centuries.This vast subterranean settlement, now famously known as Derinkuyu, remained in near-constant use for countless generations. It was not a temporary refuge or a single isolated cave system, but a fully functioning, remarkably intricate city carved meticulously deep into the earth, capable of sustaining human life for months at a time under extraordinary conditions.Derinkuyu is the largest excavated underground city in the world.Stretching across 18 levels, it descends deeper than a modern skyscraper is tall. Tunnels, chambers and rooms extend for miles beneath Cappadocia, forming a complex network that once housed as many as 20,000 people.Originally known as Elengubu, the city passed through the hands of multiple civilisations. The Phrygians, Persians and later Byzantine Christians all expanded and adapted it over centuries as reported by BBC. Its final chapter came in the early 20th century, when Cappadocian Greeks fled the region during the Greco-Turkish War, abandoning the underground city almost overnight.What makes Derinkuyu even more remarkable is the suggestion that it was not alone. Archaeologists believe it may be linked to more than 200 smaller underground cities across the region, forming a hidden network beneath the Anatolian plains.For centuries, Derinkuyu slipped from collective memory. Its rediscovery in 1963 was not the result of a planned excavation, but a domestic mystery. A local resident, frustrated by chickens repeatedly vanishing into a crack in his home, decided to investigate. While renovating, he uncovered a dark passageway behind a wall.That opening led to one of more than 600 entrances now known to exist, many hidden inside private homes. Excavations soon revealed an underground world complete with living quarters, food stores, stables, chapels, schools and wineries. In 1985, Cappadocia and its subterranean cities were recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Cappadocia’s geology made this extraordinary feat possible. The region’s soft volcanic rock, known as tuff, is easy to carve yet strong enough to remain stable. Combined with dry soil and minimal groundwater, it created ideal conditions for deep excavation using simple tools.Over millennia, the same volcanic material formed the fairy chimneys above ground. Below the surface, it allowed ancient builders to sculpt vast underground chambers with remarkable precision, long before modern engineering existed. The origins of Derinkuyu remain partly uncertain. Some historians credit the Hittites, who may have carved the earliest levels around 1200 BCE while seeking refuge from invading forces. Artefacts found within the city support this theory.However, much of the expansion is attributed to the Phrygians, an Iron Age civilisation known for their rock-cut architecture. As empires rose and fell across Anatolia, each group adapted the city to meet new needs, turning it into a layered record of human survival.Although Derinkuyu was likely used for storage in peaceful times, its primary purpose was protection. Cappadocia sat at the crossroads of empires, making it vulnerable to repeated invasions. Underground living offered safety when surface settlements were at risk.During the Byzantine era, particularly amid 7th-century raids, Derinkuyu reached its peak. Narrow corridors forced intruders to move single file, while massive circular stone doors could be rolled shut from the inside. Small holes in these doors allowed defenders to strike attackers while remaining protected. Living underground was far from comfortable. Residents relied on torchlight, stored waste in sealed clay jars and designated specific areas for the dead. Yet the city was carefully organised. Livestock were kept near the surface to manage odours and gases, while deeper levels housed homes, schools and communal spaces.Evidence of winemaking, including vats and amphorae, suggests that inhabitants prepared for long stays below ground. A Byzantine missionary school, identified by its distinctive vaulted ceilings, still stands within the maze of tunnels.Perhaps the most impressive feature of Derinkuyu is its ventilation system. More than 50 shafts circulated fresh air throughout the city, ensuring survival even when entrances were sealed. A deep well supplied clean water and could be cut off from the surface to prevent contamination.These systems suggest that air and water were central to the city’s original design. Without them, life underground on such a scale would have been impossible. Derinkuyu is the largest, but it is only one piece of a much larger puzzle. Over 200 underground cities have been discovered across Cappadocia, many connected by tunnels stretching up to 9 kilometres. Some descend three or more levels deep, each equipped with escape routes for emergencies.In 2014, archaeologists uncovered another massive underground settlement beneath Nevşehir, hinting that Cappadocia’s hidden world may still be far from fully revealed.Derinkuyu’s story ended in 1923 when its final inhabitants left. For decades, it lay silent beneath the fairy chimneys, known only to the earth above it. Today, visitors can descend into its narrow passages and experience the unsettling reality of life underground.What was once a place of fear and survival now stands as a testament to human ingenuity. Beneath Cappadocia’s beautiful surface lies a reminder that some of history’s greatest achievements were built not towards the sky, but deep into the ground.","Derinkuyu is the largest excavated underground city in the world.

Q: How much time should I be dedicating to career cushioning?

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

No outdoor loudspeakers this Ramadan: Saudi Ministry issues clear mosque rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/no-outdoor-loudspeakers-this-ramadan-saudi-ministry-issues-clear-mosque-rules/articleshow/127232745.cms,"No outdoor loudspeakers this Ramadan/Representative Image

Outdoor loudspeakers restricted to Adhan and Iqama





Circular outlines Ramadan mosque preparations





Iftar arrangements and facility readiness









As Ramadan approaches, Saudi authorities have reaffirmed strict rules governing mosque operations, with a renewed focus on sound discipline, prayer timing, and preparations for worshippers. The measures are intended to preserve the sanctity of prayers while ensuring comfort, order, and consideration for surrounding communities during the holy month.Minister of Islamic Affairs, Call and Guidance Sheikh Abdullatif Al-Sheikh confirmed that mosques across the Kingdom will not be allowed to use external loudspeakers during prayers throughout Ramadan. He clarified that outdoor speakers may be used only for the Adhan, the call to prayer, and the iqama, the second call that signals the start of congregational worship.The restriction applies to all prayers during the fasting month and is aimed at maintaining calm during worship, while limiting noise beyond mosque premises.The announcement followed the release of a circular by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Call and Guidance on Tuesday, setting out detailed instructions for mosque readiness ahead of Ramadan.The circular stressed strict adherence to official prayer times in accordance with the Umm Al-Qura calendar.It specifically highlighted the importance of calling the Isha prayer at its designated time and observing the prescribed duration between the Adhan and the iqama for each prayer.Mosques were instructed to organise iftar meals only in designated courtyard areas. The ministry also emphasised the responsible management of water donations to meet mosque requirements, while discouraging the accumulation of large quantities in storage facilities.Relevant departments were directed to strengthen the work of mosque caretakers and maintenance teams to ensure that facilities are clean, safe, and fully prepared for Ramadan. Particular attention was placed on women’s prayer areas, which the ministry said must receive the same level of care and readiness as other sections of mosques.According to the ministry, the guidelines are designed to ensure that worshippers experience a high level of organisation and care throughout Ramadan. Officials said the measures aim to create a calm, orderly, and spiritually enriching environment inside mosques, while also maintaining respect for nearby residential areas during one of the busiest periods of the Islamic calendar.","Saudi authorities have reaffirmed strict rules governing mosque operations.

What to expect next





While the UAE is known for its golden sun, residents woke up to a very different scene this Monday morning. A powerful low-pressure system has officially moved in, bringing with it a rare and dramatic display of nature: hail.As dawn broke, social media was flooded with videos from Al Rams and northern areas of Ras Al Khaimah, showing streets covered in small hailstones. This icy start wasn't just limited to the north; overnight rainfall has been soaking parts of Fujairah and Al Ain, turning the desert landscape into a cool, misty escape. For many, it’s a much-needed relief, but for those on the morning commute, it’s a signal to slow down and stay alert.According to the National Center of Meteorology (NCM), the current weather ""unsettledness"" is caused by an extension of a surface low-pressure system from the Red Sea, paired with an upper-air low. In simpler terms: cold air from the north is meeting moisture, creating perfect conditions for rain and hail.The temperature drop is noticeable across the board:As the unsettled weather continues, authorities are urging motorists and residents to take precautions:These advisories come amid a broader trend of weather system impacts on travel, daily life and coastal activities, with authorities emphasising caution near flood-prone or exposed areas.If you’re wondering whether to keep your umbrella handy, the answer is yes, but only for a little longer. The NCM predicts that while the rain may persist in northern and eastern regions throughout the day, the system will gradually weaken.However, a new challenge awaits early-morning commuters: fog. As the humidity rises and the winds calm down, thick mist is expected to blanket internal and coastal areas on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. Visibility could drop significantly, so if you have an early flight or a long drive, plan for extra time.","Temperatures are hovering between a crisp 12°C and 18°C, with recent lows previously hitting near-freezing points.

Bottom line





The United Arab Emirates is gearing up for a spell of unsettled winter weather that is expected to bring clouds, light rain , gusty winds and even blowing dust over the coming days, a marked shift from the typically dry winter skies residents are used to. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) says a low-pressure system moving across the region is behind the unstable conditions forecast through much of the week.Weather conditions across the UAE today will be partly cloudy to cloudy at times, particularly over coastal, northern and eastern regions, with a chance of rainfall in some areas. Winds are expected to be light to moderate, but may strengthen at intervals, stirring up dust in open areas and briefly reducing visibility.Adding to the wintry feel, the lowest temperature in the country this morning dropped to 5.8°C, recorded at Jais Mountain in Ras Al Khaimah at 4am, underscoring the cooler conditions gripping the northern mountainous areas as the UAE experiences its winter peak.This change in weather comes amid an overall pattern of winter variability, with cooler temperatures in the mountains and partly cloudy skies near the coast.Daytime highs will still be mild, in the mid-20s Celsius but residents should prepare for intermittent rain, dropping temperatures, humidity overnight and dust-raising winds.According to the latest weather outlook from the NCM -Unsettled weather can affect daily routines, especially travel. Light rain or mist in the mornings may lead to slippery roads and reduced visibility for motorists, and gusty winds could impact driving conditions in exposed areas. Drivers should stay alert and adjust speeds accordingly. Recent traffic safety guides note that rainy or unstable conditions can lead to longer braking distances and recommend extra caution behind the wheel, particularly in reduced visibility or wet roads.Dust-raising winds and sudden cloud build-ups can disrupt outdoor plans, from sporting events to picnics. Although daytime temperatures remain pleasant for winter, blown dust can cause air quality dips and eye or respiratory irritation, especially for sensitive individuals such as children and those with asthma.For marine enthusiasts and sailors, the forecast suggests a need for caution. Rougher seas in the Arabian Gulf could make conditions choppy for small boats and swimmers. Coastal communities and marinas should monitor updates from the NCM before heading out on the water.Unusual bouts of winter rain and unstable weather are not unprecedented in the UAE. Historical data show the country has seen dynamic winter patterns caused by low-pressure systems and shifting wind currents, leading to intermittent rainfall, dust storms and cloudy spells. A February 2025 report noted similar patterns of wind, dust and rain due to low-pressure systems and Shamal winds.In fact, the UAE occasionally records rare weather events — such as heavy rainfall and low temperatures high in the mountains — that remind residents that winter in the Gulf can be more variable than assumed.In light of the unsettled forecast, here are some practical tips UAE residents should consider:As the UAE’s winter unfolds, residents should be prepared for a mix of cooler temperatures, intermittent rain and changing wind patterns before clearer skies return later in the week. While these conditions may not disrupt life dramatically, they highlight how quickly weather, even in an otherwise arid region, can shift with atmospheric systems passing through.Whether you are planning a beach day, a road trip, or simply a morning commute, staying ahead of the forecast and adjusting plans accordingly will help ensure safety and comfort during this unsettled weather period.","The lowest temperature in the country this morning dropped to 5.8°C, recorded at Jais Mountain in Ras Al Khaimah at 4:00 UAE Local Time.

“

Storm Chandra

will bring persistent rain, heavy at times, later Monday and overnight before steadily clearing northeastwards on Tuesday morning. 30–50mm rainfall is likely widely, with 60–80mm across some higher ground, especially south Dartmoor. Falling on saturated ground, this is likely to lead to flooding and disruption, particularly on Tuesday morning. Strong southeasterly winds are also expected.”

“Whilst accumulating snow is unlikely at low-levels, there will be a sharp increase in snow depths with elevation, with the potential for 2–5cm in places above about 300m, 5–10cm above 400m, and 10–20cm above 500m. This may impact some high-level routes, with drifting possible in rather brisk southeasterly winds. Strong, gusty winds, especially to the west of hills, may exacerbate the potential for transport disruption.”

“Storm Chandra will bring a range of hazards to the UK through Monday night and Tuesday. Initially strong winds will impact the Isles of Scilly, western Cornwall and southwest Wales which are still vulnerable after Storm Goretti, gusts of 70 to 80mph are possible here. Heavy rain is an additional hazard as it falls on saturated ground in Dorset and southern parts of Devon, Somerset and Cornwall.

As Chandra interacts with colder air further north snow becomes a hazard, with 10–20cm of snow possibly accumulating over higher ground in the Pennines, southern Scotland and the Highlands. With a complex spell of weather, it’s important people stay up to date with the forecast and any warnings in your area.”

The three items households are urged to have ready

First, a torch. British Gas recommends a battery-powered or wind-up (kinetic) torch to ensure light is available if electricity supplies are interrupted.

Second, spare batteries. Households are advised to stock up on appropriate batteries. such as AA or AAA, for torches and other essential devices.

Third, a backup charger for mobile phones. A portable battery pack with a charging cable can help people stay connected and access updates during an outage.

The Met Office has issued a series of weather warnings covering snow, rain and wind from late Monday through Tuesday. These include a 17-hour yellow warning for rain and snow from midnight Tuesday until 5pm, an amber warning for wind in eastern Northern Ireland, and an amber warning for rain across parts of south-west England.Explaining the risk in the south of England, the Met Office said:In northern England and Scotland, snow rather than rain is the main concern. The Met Office warned:In a broader briefing on the storm, the Met Office said Storm Chandra will bring “a further spell of wet and windy conditions later Monday and into Tuesday”, with gusty winds initially affecting the Isles of Scilly, western Cornwall and south-west Wales before moving north through the Irish Sea.An amber warning for wind has been issued for eastern Northern Ireland, where gusts of 60–70mph are expected widely, with up to 75mph possible in coastal areas. Heavy rain falling on already saturated ground in south Devon, Dorset, southern Somerset and south-east Cornwall could lead to flooding, while colder air further north will turn precipitation into hill snow across northern England and Scotland.Met Office Chief Forecaster Paul Gundersen said:With the risk of power cuts rising during periods of severe weather, energy firm British Gas has urged households to make sure they have three key items readily available.British Gas added:While additional supplies such as non-perishable food and blankets can be useful, the focus of the advice is on lighting, communication and access to information during potential power disruptions as Storm Chandra moves across the UK.","UK households urged to prepare torches, spare batteries and phone chargers ahead of potential power cuts.

Samuel was sent this picture as claimed proof of delivery, though he pointed out the phone should have been signed for (Kennedy News and Media)





A delivery driver has been removed after home security footage appeared to show him faking the delivery of a £1,200 iPhone and driving away with the parcel instead.Samuel Taylor, 20, from Rochdale, ordered a £1,264 iPhone 17 Pro Max through Giffgaff, with delivery handled by DPD. On 19 January, Taylor received a photo notification claiming the parcel had been posted through his letterbox. When he returned home from work, the phone was nowhere to be found. His father confirmed no delivery had taken place.Footage from the family’s security camera showed a courier pulling up outside the house, selecting a parcel from his van and approaching the front door. Moments later, the driver appeared to walk back to the vehicle still holding the same package before driving off.“I was shocked,” Taylor said. “When I got home my dad said it wasn’t actually there. We checked the cameras and saw what happened. I was just really annoyed and I feel robbed.”Taylor contacted DPD to complain but said he was initially told the phone had been delivered and advised to raise the issue with Giffgaff. Instead, he reported the incident to Greater Manchester Police and posted the footage on social media in an effort to force the company to respond.“Since DPD are not interested in their driver not delivering my £1,200 iPhone I thought I’d shame them on here,” he wrote.Reviewing the footage later, Taylor said it became clear the driver appeared unaware he was being recorded, ruling out the possibility of an administrative mix-up or a delayed return to the depot.“I don’t think he noticed the cameras,” Taylor said. “I thought it might’ve gone back to the warehouse, but we got in touch with DPD and they said it hadn’t been signed back in.DPD later confirmed that the driver had been “removed from the business” following an internal investigation. A spokesperson said: “We have carried out a thorough investigation and can confirm that the driver has been removed from the business. We have a zero-tolerance approach to incidents such as this and will always take firm action. We apologise whole-heartedly to Mr Taylor and have informed Giffgaff.”Giffgaff said the proof of delivery did not meet its standards and confirmed Taylor’s deposit had been refunded while the case is reviewed. “We’re sorry to hear that Samuel did not receive his new iPhone as intended,” a spokesperson said.Taylor said he still has not received the phone and no longer trusts the courier. “With something that expensive it has to be signed for anyway,” he said. “I just want the phone I paid for.”","Samuel Taylor, 20, from Rochdale, ordered a £1,264 iPhone 17 Pro Max through Giffgaff, with delivery handled by DPD.

"Sweden unearths a 5,000-year-old dog buried with a dagger, hints at elite treatment",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/sweden-unearths-a-5000-year-old-dog-buried-with-a-dagger-hints-at-elite-treatment/articleshow/127505466.cms,"The ‘ dog burial ’ that stopped archaeologists in their tracks

What the dagger reveals about the burial

What archaeologists hope to learn next





Archaeologists in Sweden have uncovered a striking Stone Age discovery: The well-preserved remains of a dog buried around 5,000 years ago alongside a carefully crafted dagger made from bone. The burial was found in a wetland that was once a lake, a setting that helped protect fragile remains for millennia. What makes the find so fascinating is how deliberate it appears. This was not a random deposit or scattered bones. The placement suggests intention, meaning, and possibly even ceremony. To researchers, the message is clear: This dog may have been valued far beyond an ordinary animal.The dog’s skeleton was found in remarkably good condition, especially for something this old. It was uncovered by archaeologists from Arkeologerna, a unit within Sweden’s National Historical Museums, during an excavation at Logsjomossen near Jarna linked to construction work for the Ostlanken railway project. Because the burial lay in waterlogged sediments from what was once a lake, the wetland environment helped preserve fragile organic remains far better than normal soil would. What struck researchers immediately was how intentional it looked, as if someone had carefully placed the dog there rather than leaving it behind as simple waste.Alongside the dog was a polished bone dagger, described as long and finely made. In prehistoric societies, objects like this were not casual possessions. A blade tool could represent skill, status, or even symbolic meaning, depending on the culture and context.The fact that it was placed with the dog suggests the animal had significance. The dagger may have been a grave gift, a sign of honour, or something meant to accompany the dog in death.Dogs in the Stone Age were not only companions. They could be protectors, hunting partners, trackers, and vital members of daily survival. A strong, reliable dog might have been seen as part of the group’s success, especially in harsh environments where every advantage mattered.A careful burial could reflect gratitude, respect, or an emotional bond. It may also indicate that this dog held a special role, possibly linked to hunting, guarding, or ritual significance in the community.The burial was found in sediments that once sat at the bottom of a shallow lake. That detail matters because water and wetlands have long been associated with ritual deposits in ancient Europe. People often placed valued objects into lakes, bogs, and rivers as offerings or ceremonial acts.If this was a ritual burial, it adds a deeper layer to the story. It suggests the dog was not only important in life, but still held meaning after death.Discoveries like this rarely give up their secrets immediately. Researchers will likely study the remains through dating and lab analysis to understand details such as the dog’s life, diet, health, and age at death.Over time, the burial could help answer bigger questions about how Stone Age people in Scandinavia lived, what role dogs played in their societies, and how early humans expressed loyalty, care, and respect for animals that shared their world.","Archaeologists in Sweden have uncovered a striking Stone Age discovery: the well-preserved remains of a dog buried around 5,000 years ago.

A travel reset worth the road trip from UAE to Khasab







If you are in the UAE and craving a break from the city buzz but don't want to hop on a long flight, there is a serene, breathtaking corner of the Arabian Peninsula that is quietly becoming one of the Middle East ’s most rewarding nature getaways: Khasab in Oman. Often called the “Norway of Arabia”, this fjord-lined coastal town on the Musandam Peninsula delivers dramatic scenery, calm turquoise waters, playful marine life and a slower pace that feels like another world entirely, all just a short road trip away.Khasab sits on the Musandam Peninsula, an Omani exclave separated from the rest of Oman by the UAE. It is roughly a 2.5-hour drive from Dubai but once you cross the border, the striking landscape of steep mountains, fjord-like inlets and clear sea instantly wipes away any sense of city stress. The drive itself sets the tone, winding along coastal cliffs that plunge into deep, brilliant blue waters. There is little traffic and plenty of photo stops and by the time you reach Khasab, the transition from urban rush to nature’s calm is complete.What really sets Khasab apart is its dramatic fjords. These towering rock formations rising directly from glassy sea create a landscape that feels more like Scandinavia than the Arabian Peninsula. Taking a traditional Omani dhow cruise through these waterways is one of the quintessential ways to experience the region, with gentle breezes, calm seas and panoramic viewpoints in every direction.On these dhow boats you will often spot dolphins swimming alongside, a crowd-delighting feature of many cruises, especially in calmer morning waters.Local tour companies emphasise the high chances of dolphin sightings and immersive experiences that include swimming and snorkelling in sheltered coves.One of Khasab’s most magical moments is how effortlessly dolphins appear, gliding alongside boats as if they have always belonged there. Traditional dhow cruises also drift past isolated fishing villages accessible only by water, where life unfolds slowly and simply, far removed from the gloss and rush of city living.The turquoise waters around Musandam are not just beautiful; they are invitingly calm, making snorkelling and even beginner-friendly aquatic adventures very accessible. The sheltered fjords, like Khor Shem, offer crystal-clear conditions to float above vibrant coral and fish life, while kayaks let you explore hidden coves at your own pace.Meanwhile, traditional fishing villages dot the coastline, where life moves at its own rhythm. Some are accessible only by boat, offering a rare glimpse into coastal Omani culture untouched by the tourist trappings seen elsewhere.For travellers who want to linger, overnight dhow cruises offer an even richer perspective. These trips combine dolphin watching, kayaking, fishing and guided hikes and often include multi-course meals and gentle evenings anchored under starry skies. The experience lets visitors feel fully immersed in Musandam’s natural majesty — not just passing through it.With border crossings streamlined and travel buzz returning in early 2026, Khasab has emerged as a practical, scenic escape for UAE motorists and weekend adventurers. It is the kind of landscape that is easy to contactless book through tour operators that run day cruises and overnight stays, yet still rewarding for independent travellers who drive themselves across the border.Importantly, safety and tourism infrastructure, from boats to guides, means that even first-time visitors can enjoy this rugged beauty without stress. However, it is not just the dramatic fjords and dolphins. The peaceful natural environment and slower pace of life are big draws for anyone feeling the strain of urban living.Here’s how travellers are enhancing their Khasab trips -Khasab is not just another scenic destination, it is becoming a symbol of accessible adventure for Gulf residents. Just a few hours from the UAE’s glitzy cities, this calm and dramatic corner of Oman delivers fjord landscapes, wildlife encounters and a sense of peace that’s rare and memorable. Whether you are planning a weekend reset, a family outing or a deeper tropical exploration, Khasab brings nature and a touch of magic right to your doorstep.For UAE residents without a visa hassle, remember that Oman often allows UAE residents a visa-free entry if your residency card is valid, making spontaneous Khasab road trips even easier.","Khasab sits on the Musandam Peninsula, an Omani exclave separated from the rest of Oman by the UAE.

Careful sampling from valuable artefacts

Chemical signatures point to a cosmic source

Implications for Iberian Bronze Age chronology

A rare confirmation for the Iberian Peninsula





The Treasure of Villena has been studied for decades and mostly admired for its gold. Found near Alicante in 1963, the hoard contains dozens of finely worked objects that sit comfortably within what archaeologists expect from the Late Bronze Age. Yet two small pieces never quite fit. They were dull, corroded, and made of iron at a time when iron was not meant to exist in Iberia. For years they were treated as curiosities or possible intrusions from a later period. New scientific analysis now places them firmly back in the Bronze Age and suggests their metal did not come from the Earth at all. Instead, it appears to have fallen from the sky.Among the gold bowls, bracelets and vessels were a plain open bracelet and a small hollow hemisphere covered with pierced gold sheet. Both looked out of place from the start. Their dark surface and heavy corrosion stood in sharp contrast to the surrounding goldwork. Early descriptions noted their iron-like appearance but stopped short of firm identification. Because large-scale iron production in Iberia began much later, these pieces caused discomfort. Some scholars suggested they must belong to a later phase, despite being found within a closed Bronze Age deposit.Before humans learnt how to smelt iron from ores, the only workable iron available was meteoritic. Iron meteorites are rich in nickel and cobalt, elements that are usually absent or present only in trace amounts in early terrestrial iron. Across the ancient world, a small number of prestige objects made from meteoritic iron are known, including beads from Egypt and the famous dagger from Tutankhamun’s tomb. These objects were rare, difficult to work with, and often symbolically charged.Identifying meteoritic iron is not straightforward, especially in objects that have been buried for thousands of years. Iron corrodes readily, and over long periods the corrosion process can strip away nickel and other elements that would normally signal an extraterrestrial origin. In extreme cases, little or no metal survives beneath the rust. This makes traditional metallographic analysis risky or impossible, particularly for museum objects that cannot be cut or transported easily.In 2007, researchers were granted permission to take tiny samples from the corroded surfaces of the Villena objects. The amounts removed were minute, taken from areas already damaged by oxidation. Later, a second slightly deeper sample was taken from the bracelet to improve confidence in the results. These samples consisted entirely of corrosion products rather than fresh metal, reflecting the fragile state of the objects.Despite these limitations, chemical analysis revealed patterns consistent with meteoritic iron. The ratios of nickel to iron and nickel to cobalt aligned closely with values seen in heavily weathered meteorites rather than terrestrial iron. While absolute nickel levels were low, this was expected given the age and degree of corrosion. When compared against published datasets, the Villena samples fell within the range associated with altered meteoritic material.If the Villena iron pieces are meteoritic, their presence no longer forces a later date for the treasure. Instead, they support a Late Bronze Age chronology before widespread iron production began in the region. This fits well with other evidence linking the Villena hoard to nearby sites such as Cabezo Redondo, which was abandoned before 1200 BC. The objects may have been valued not for practical use but for their rarity and origin.These findings make the Villena objects the first confirmed meteoritic iron artefacts from the Iberian Peninsula. While similar items are known elsewhere in Europe, they are uncommon and often slightly later in date. Further non-invasive testing could strengthen the case, but even now, the evidence suggests that Bronze Age communities in Iberia had access to and recognised the value of iron from space. The two modest objects, once overlooked, now sit quietly at the centre of a much larger story.","Researchers identify meteoritic iron in a 3,000-year-old Iberian treasure.

World’s longest road tunnel takes drivers on a 20-minute journey without daylight beneath Norway’s mountains,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/worlds-longest-road-tunnel-takes-drivers-on-a-20-minute-journey-without-daylight-beneath-norways-mountains/articleshow/127533646.cms,"AI Generated

The Laerdal Tunnel: Longest road tunnel designed for drivers in Norway



How the Lærdal Tunnel’s lighting reduces driver fatigue





Advanced safety features inside the Lærdal Tunnel







Traveling through tunnels is usually just a normal part of a trip, but the Laerdal Tunnel in Norway is something special. The tunnel is 15.2 miles long and goes under a mountain range that looks like it came straight out of a movie. Drivers can go through the tunnel for up to 20 minutes without ever seeing the sun. The tunnel connects the towns of Laerdal and Aurland. It is an important way to get from Oslo in the east to Bergen in the west. Every year, thousands of people who work, visit, or move goods through the tunnel. The tunnel is not just a way to get from one place to another. People all over the world call it an engineering marvel because of its size, shape, and usefulness, which make it easy for people to get around. It shows that infrastructure can put people first, even when the ground is hard to work with.According to The Sun reports, after about five years of building, the Laerdal Tunnel opened in November 2000. It cost 1.08 billion Norwegian kroner, which is about £80 million. It goes through a mountain range with peaks that are 1,400 meters high, making it the longest road tunnel in the world. Engineers had to make sure that the structure was safe and that drivers could drive comfortably over such a long underground stretch without losing their focus or getting lost.Unlike most tunnels, Laerdal is not a boring tube. The design shows that the people who made it knew that people can get bored in long, closed spaces. To fix this, the tunnel has sections that are wider and more like caves at regular intervals. These parts give drivers a break from the view and a place to pull over.A big new feature of the Laerdal Tunnel is its innovative lighting system. The lights are warm blue and orange tones that illuminate different areas instead of relying on a long, monotonous strip of white fluorescent lights. These creatively coloured rooms make the drive less boring and visually stimulating, which helps keep drivers from getting tired, drowsy, or distracted and encourages them to stay awake and alert. Some of these rooms are spacious enough for cars to park safely and comfortably. This thoughtful design gives long-haul drivers or anyone who is tired a chance to take a short rest break, stretch, and rejuvenate before moving on. The tunnel makes the long underground passage safer, more comfortable, and remarkably unique, creating a one-of-a-kind experience for all drivers passing through.Safety has always been the most important thing in the Laerdal Tunnel. The tunnel has a modern ventilation system that makes sure the air is clean and easy to breathe the whole way through. Fifteen cameras watch traffic and accidents so that help can be sent right away if needed. If there is an accident, automated systems can quickly close the tunnel to stop other problems from happening.There are also safety points every 500 meters that include fire extinguishers, emergency phones, and other critical safety equipment. This is important because it means that drivers can get help right away if they need it. The Laerdal Tunnel is not only the longest road tunnel in the world, but it is also one of the safest. Everyone knows the Lærdal Tunnel as a tourist attraction and as a practical road. Many reviews mention how beautiful the colored tunnels are and how cool it is to drive through the mountains for 20 minutes. Those who visit the tunnel often say that they are always amazed by how large and well-constructed it is. Some even say that it feels more like an adventure than a ride.The tunnel itself is a reason for people who have never visited Norway to visit the country. It proves how much Norway is interested in new ideas, in building, and in making driving easier.","The Laerdal Tunnel in Norway is 15.2 miles long and goes under a mountain range that looks like it came straight out of a movie.

Understanding Sundogs: When ‘two suns’ appeared in the sky over Russia



How Sundogs form : Science behind the illusion



Colours, shapes, and the physics behind sundogs



Origins of the term “Sundog”



Ideal conditions for observing sundogs



Historical and scientific significance







Residents of Russia's Sakhalin region were treated to a surreal sight recently: what looked like two suns rising side by side in the morning sky. The breathtaking view quickly went viral on social media, but it's not some sort of celestial aberration-it's an atmospheric optical phenomenon known as a sundog. Sundogs, also referred to as mock suns or parhelia, form when sunlight intersects with hexagonal ice crystals that hang suspended in the atmosphere, most commonly in high cirrus clouds or as diamond dust under extremely cold conditions. When the sun's rays pass through and are refracted by such crystals, they create bright, often colorful spots flanking the real Sun. Though unusual and striking for the ordinary observer, sundogs are well-known to scientists, offering a stunning demonstration of the ways in which light and ice can transform the sky for a time.Sundogs, which can also be called mock suns or parhelia, can be perceived as a series of colorful light phenomena appearing adjacent to the Sun. They can form at either side, or in some cases, at both, which is why sundogs can appear as though there is more than one Sun. The literal translation of “parhelia” is beside the Sun, which is a fitting description of sundogs. This is due to the two words from which this term is composed: the prefix ‘para’, which means beside, and ‘helios’, which means Sun.Sundogs, in fact, are associated with other optical effects such as the Sun halo and the Moon halo. In fact, all of these are associated with the refraction and diffraction of sunlight by ice crystals in the atmosphere, which often align horizontally, producing a stunning and sometimes rare visual spectacle for observers.At the core of every sundog are always ice crystals in flat, hexagonal forms lofted high in the atmosphere, in cirrus or cirrostratus clouds at an altitude of anywhere from 20,000 to 40,000 feet. However, in very cold climates, ice crystals also occur in ""diamond dust"" forms at lower altitudes when the temperature plummets below minus 30 degrees Celsius.Generally, the flat, plate-like crystals are aligned horizontally as they fall, with a little wobbling because of the currents of air. If the rays of sunlight enter the crystal at one face and then exit at the other at an angle of 60 degrees, then the rays are subject to refraction twice. This bends the rays at an angle of at least 22 degrees, accounting for the fact that sundogs are at the same height above the horizon as the Sun.Usually, if there is a concentration of light within a bright spot as opposed to a full circle, this is referred to as two sundogs, which can even take on the demeanor and allure referred to as “false suns” accompanying the true sun itself, as a result of this geometric wonder.The sundogs are not typically bright white, though often tinted with a pretty color that occurs as a result of a phenomenon involving the diffused light of the sun. The area closest to the sun often displays shades of red, which deepen to orange and then yellow, graduating into blue around the edges. There are different refractions of light with different wavelengths, with red light, having a larger wavelength, bending less than blue light to create a sideways rainbow effect of ROY G.BIV.The size and shape of sundogs can differ depending on their crystal size and wobbles. The size of crystals can be substantial, which causes them to wobble while they are in a fall, extending sundogs during this time. On other occasions, they can combine in parts of a complete 22° halo, which makes them less prominent but ethereal.The name 'sundog' for this phenomenon seems to have mythological, rather than scientific, origins. The old world viewed this as the brilliant spots being followed by the sun, as a dog is supposed to follow its owner. In Greek mythology, the sky god Zeus was said to travel across the sky with two dogs, and they were referred to as 'false suns,' signifying their glow.The technical term, ""parhelia,"" consists of ""para"" which means ""with"" and ""helio"" which means ""Sun,"" which literally describes a parhelion ""with the Sun."" The attractive and colorful term ""sundog"" eventually became a popular term to describe a parhelion.While sundogs can happen anywhere in the world at any time when the Sun is above the horizon, their visibility depends on specific conditions. A low Sun-almost during sunrise or sunset-is enhancing because light passes through ice crystals at a shallower angle, resulting in more pronounced bright spots.Cold weather also plays a significant role. In sub-zero temperatures, especially during winters at higher latitudes, there is a greater possibility of the atmosphere containing the hexagonal ice crystals required for producing sundogs. Thus, Sakhalin hosts ideal weather for watching this rare optical illusion in cold winters.Before the scientific theories of the refraction and dispersion of light, sundogs gave birth to several myths and legends. Sundogs have also been viewed as omens, the signs of the divine, or the companions of the Sun. But with experiments conducted by the pioneer, Sir Isaac Newton, to show us the exact reasons behind sundogs, we have an in-depth scientific knowledge.The recent display from Sakhalin serves as a noteworthy reminder that even ""ordinary"" sunlight, in its encounter with nature in certain forms, often results in ""extraordinary"" optical phenomena. One appreciates here the beauty in optical phenomena in nature in connection with their interrelation with light in its various forms.","Residents of Russia's Sakhalin region were treated to a surreal sight recently: what looked like two suns rising side by side in the morning sky. The breathtaking view quickly went viral on social media, but it's not some sort of celestial aberration-it's an atmospheric optical phenomenon known as a sundog. Sundogs, also referred to as mock suns or parhelia, can be perceived as a series of colorful light phenomena appearing adjacent to the Sun.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127460857,imgsize-12124,width-400,resizemode-4/did-russia-really-witness-two-suns-inside-the-rare-sundog-phenomenon-that-stunned-sakhalin-residents.jpg"

What returned with the water

Why farming remains tied to the lakebed

How Indigenous knowledge frames the event

What Tulare Lake’s return leaves behind

.





Water flooded areas of California's San Joaquin Valley in the spring of 2023, where roads and agriculture had been in place for decades. Rivers were forced out of their channels by frequent strong storms and snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada. Shallow seas swept fields away. For those who knew the region, what many saw as abrupt flooding was actually something older and less unexpected. Once thought to be obliterated, Tulare Lake was now filling up once more. The lake, which the Yokuts called Pa'ashi, or huge water, used to dominate the valley floor. About 94,000 acres were affected by its reappearance, upsetting infrastructure and agriculture. It also reopened deeper questions about memory, land use, and how California manages water in a changing climate.Before large-scale water engineering, Tulare Lake was the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River. At times it stretched close to 100 miles in length and 30 miles in width. Fed mainly by the Kern, Kings, Tule and Kaweah rivers, the lake expanded and shrank with seasonal flows.For the Yokuts people, Pa’ashi was not a fixed body of water but a living system. Its edges moved. Fish, birds and wetland plants followed the rhythms of wet and dry years.Settlers arriving in the nineteenth century struggled with this variability, often mistaking dry periods for permanence.By the late 1800s, canals, levees and dams redirected the rivers that fed Tulare Lake. The goal was agricultural expansion. Cotton, alfalfa and later almonds replaced wetlands. By 1898, the lakebed appeared dry, and many settlers declared the lake gone.That confidence proved fragile. Tulare Lake refilled several times in the early twentieth century. Major floods occurred in 1906, 1916, 1921 and again in the late 1930s. Each time, farms planted on the lakebed were inundated. Each time the water eventually receded, and memory faded again.The winter of 2022 and 2023 brought record snowfall to the Sierra Nevada. Spring warming released that water quickly. At the same time, a series of atmospheric river storms added rain across the valley. Levees and diversion systems designed for farming could not fully contain the flow. Water moved toward its lowest point, the historic lakebed. Over weeks, Tulare Lake reformed, reaching a size comparable to Lake Tahoe. Roads, dairies and orchards were left surrounded by shallow water.The lake brought more than flooding. Birds arrived in large numbers. Wading species spread across the new shoreline. Fish appeared in channels and pools. Local residents reported cooler breezes and higher humidity near the water.These changes echoed historical accounts. Early settlers wrote of winds driven by the open lake surface and of wildlife returning as soon as water settled. The reappearance of these patterns suggests that the valley floor still responds quickly when water is allowed to spread.Much of the land now underwater has been farmed intensively for generations. The soil is fertile. Infrastructure is already in place. From an economic view, abandoning the area feels impossible. Yet the repeated flooding history shows a pattern. When wet years arrive, the lake returns. When dry years follow, planting resumes. Each cycle brings losses. Climate change adds uncertainty, increasing the chances of extreme swings between drought and flood.For the Yokuts, Pa’ashi was never erased. The lake’s name and stories preserved its presence even when maps did not. From this view, the 2023 flooding was not a disaster alone but a reminder of an older truth about the land. This perspective challenges the idea that control over water is complete or permanent. It also raises questions about whose knowledge shaped California’s development and whose was ignored.As waters slowly recede, some fields may be replanted. Others may remain too damaged. Legal and political debates continue over responsibility, compensation and future planning. The lake does not offer a conclusion. It leaves behind wet soil, altered air, and a visible outline of something that was meant to be forgotten. Pa’ashi returned without ceremony. It may not stay. History suggests it will not be the last time.This article is based on the feature of OPEN RIVERS","Tulare Lake was the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River.

Evidence of reuse under later rulers

What the discovery adds to Egyptian history





Archaeologists working near Luxor have identified the remains of a large royal city dating back around 3,400 years, offering a detailed look at daily life during one of ancient Egypt’s most powerful periods. The settlement was built under Pharaoh Amenhotep III and later inherited by his son Akhenaten, whose radical religious reforms reshaped Egyptian history. Found within the ancient capital of Thebes, the site includes homes, workshops, administrative buildings and burial areas, many preserved to an unusual degree. Officials described it in 2021 as the “lost golden city of Luxor”, pointing to its scale and condition rather than any single monument. The discovery adds context to a period marked by wealth, upheaval and a sudden break with long-held tradition. Artefacts, streets, ovens, seals, and walls reveal economic organisation, craft production, family routines, and governance structures fragmented across Egypt’s record. National Geographic mentions excavation revealed a dense urban area enclosed by mudbrick walls that in places rise to around nine feet. Inside, rooms were filled with everyday objects left where they were last used.Pottery vessels, tools and food remains suggested the city was active and organised, rather than ceremonial alone. Some buildings appeared domestic, while others showed signs of planning and record keeping. Archaeologists also identified streets and defined neighbourhoods, hinting at a carefully managed royal settlement rather than a temporary camp.The 18th dynasty, when Amenhotep III ruled, was characterised by powerful diplomacy, abundant resources, and large-scale construction projects. Throughout Egypt, his court supervised buildings, statues, and temples. This activity seems to have been fostered by the recently discovered city, which served as an administrative and industrial hub connected to the larger capital at Thebes. Evidence of large-scale food preparation was discovered alongside items associated with the manufacturing of glass and metal. This confirms long-held beliefs that Amenhotep III's rule was one of excess and stability, based on a sophisticated labour system.After Amenhotep III’s death, his son Akhenaten took a sharply different path. He rejected Egypt’s traditional gods in favour of a single sun deity, Aten, and moved the royal court to a new city called Akhetaten, now known as Amarna. The discovery near Luxor suggests Akhenaten inherited a functioning and productive city, raising questions about why he chose to abandon Thebes altogether. Archaeologists believe the settlement was active during the early years of his rule, before being partially left behind as power shifted north.One of the most striking aspects of the site was the amount of material linked to ordinary labour. A bakery and kitchen complex was identified, with large ovens and storage jars. Other areas showed traces of workshops used for jewellery, metal tools and decorative objects. These findings help balance the historical record, which often focuses on kings and temples rather than workers and craftspeople. The layout suggests people lived close to where they worked, within a tightly organised royal economy.The city did not vanish immediately after Akhenaten’s reign. Archaeologists found signs that it was reused during the time of Tutankhamun, who restored traditional religion and ruled from Memphis rather than Thebes or Amarna. Objects from later periods suggested continued, though reduced, activity. Ay, who succeeded Tutankhamun, may also have made use of the site. Layers of occupation showed that parts of the settlement remained in use well into the Coptic Byzantine era before finally being covered by sand.The importance of the site lies less in spectacle and more in detail. Its preservation allows archaeologists to study how a royal city functioned at ground level. It also provides context for one of Egypt’s most dramatic political and religious shifts. Rather than viewing Akhenaten’s reforms in isolation, researchers can now place them against the backdrop of a thriving urban centre he chose to leave behind. The city near Luxor does not answer every question, but it quietly fills gaps in a long and complicated story.","Archaeologists working near Luxor have identified the remains of a large royal city dating back around 3,400 years.

“embarrassingly small”

MrBeast says he would pay more than Netflix for Honnold’s Taipei 101 climb







Popular YouTuber MrBeast has reacted to the recent free solo climb of Taipei 101 by Alex Honnold , stating that he would have given the climber over $500,000 to do the stunt on his YouTube channel. Alex Honnold successfully climbed the 1,667-foot Taipei 101 skyscraper in Taiwan on January 25, 2026, without the use of a harness, ropes, parachute, or any safety gear. The climb, which took approximately 90 minutes, was live on Netflix as part of theshow.Reports suggest that Netflix paid Honnold roughly $500,000 for the climb, which he calledcompared to salaries in mainstream sports. MrBeast shared on X that he would have offered even more for the stunt if it had been on his platform. Honnold himself noted that he would have done the climb for free but appreciated the money to support his camera crew friends.The Taipei 101 climb has been described as the largest urban free solo ever attempted. Honnold used the building’s exterior features, protrusions, and decorative elements as handholds and footholds to reach the spire. The feat was watched live by millions globally, highlighting Honnold’s precision, skill, and fearlessness.The news of MrBeast’s comments added an interesting twist to the story. While Netflix secured the live broadcast and paid Honnold mid-six figures, MrBeast’s statement suggests YouTube could compete for even more daring stunts in the future. Fans praised Honnold’s climb and expressed amazement at the risks involved, while others debated the ethics and safety of offering large sums for extreme stunts.The climb by Honnold shows the increasing popularity of extreme urban climbs and live streaming events.

What is Ejari in Dubai? Why expats can face rental trouble and legal visa issues without it?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/what-is-ejari-in-dubai-why-expats-can-face-rental-trouble-and-legal-visa-issues-without-it/articleshow/127372648.cms,"New expats in Dubai face major hurdles if their rent isn’t Ejari-registered / AI Image

What is Ejari in Dubai?

What can go wrong without Ejari?

You cannot activate electricity or water through DEWA without an Ejari number.

Immigration authorities require it for your residency visa and for sponsoring family members.

and for sponsoring family members. Telecom providers like Etisalat and Du use it to verify your home address.

If your landlord tries to raise the rent illegally or evict you without notice, the Rental Dispute Settlement Centre (RDSC) will only hear your case if you have a registered Ejari.

Common mistakes among expats

If the landlord doesn’t register Ejari promptly, tenants can be stuck without utilities.

In shared homes or co-living setups, all occupants must be declared on Ejari; failure to do so can cause service issues or legal complications.

Some rentals are wrongly uploaded as “rented” in the system, blocking new Ejari registrations until previous records are cleared.





For thousands of expats arriving in Dubai this month, the hunt for the perfect home is the first major hurdle. However, a wave of sophisticated rental scams emerged in early 2026, targeting newcomers who are eager to secure housing quickly. Fraudsters are increasingly posing as legitimate agents or owners, offering luxury apartments at below-market rates to lure in unsuspecting tenants.These ""phantom landlords"" often present official-looking contracts but intentionally skip the most crucial step: Ejari registration. Without this government-verified document, a tenant has no legal standing, making them vulnerable to ""double-leasing"" (where the same unit is rented to multiple people) or vanishing ""agents"" who pocket the deposit and disappear.Ejari (Arabic for my rent) is the official online registration system managed by the Dubai Land Department and Real Estate Regulatory Agency (RERA), designed to digitally record every tenancy contract. Until that registration is complete, a lease is effectively invisible to authorities and vendors.Ejari transforms a private agreement into a legally binding document recognized by the state. Beyond just proving you live there, this certificate is the ""master key"" required to unlock almost every essential service in the city.Without a valid Ejari, new expats find themselves stuck in a bureaucratic limbo, unable to complete basic tasks that are vital for settling into their new lives.George (not his real name) arrived in Dubai, found an apartment, signed a lease, paid his deposit, but skipped Ejari registration. Almost immediately, he ran into problems: DEWA (electricity/water authority) blocked his applications. Telecom companies wouldn’t connect broadband. Visa-related processes stalled. Verification of his address couldn’t proceed. Without the Ejari certificate, nothing worked.This isn’t rare, dozens of renters share similar experiences online where utilities, government services and official procedures are halted without Ejari. Registration isn’t just bureaucratic formality; it’s a legal gateway for life in Dubai.Key issues when Ejari is missing:One major confusion stems from the belief that a signed tenancy contract alone is enough. In fact, it’s not, only once a contract is uploaded and approved in Ejari is it formally recognised by authorities, courts, and service providers.Another frequent issue is who handles registration. By law, landlords are responsible, but in practice many tenants end up doing it themselves or paying agents or typing centres to process the paperwork. Without clarity on who manages Ejari, delays often occur.Here’s why that matters:The impact of following these regulations is peace of mind. By insisting on an Ejari-registered contract, expats ensure they are part of a regulated, transparent ecosystem. It prevents the heartbreak of ""rental ghosting"" and ensures that the thousands of dirhams spent on deposits and rent are protected by UAE law.As Dubai continues to grow, these digital safeguards are designed to make the city one of the most secure rental markets in the world, provided that tenants take that final, 30-minute step to make their contract official.","Ejari (Arabic for my rent) is the official online registration system managed by the Dubai Land Department and Real Estate Regulatory Agency.

Drive Cautiously: Be prepared for sudden fog patches on major highways like E11 and E311.

Outdoor Prep: If you’re planning a desert camp, ensure your gear is moisture-resistant to handle the damp morning air.





After weeks of clear, dry skies, the UAE is bracing for a change in pace as a weak low-pressure system moves in from the east.According to the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM), residents can expect a shift toward more unsettled conditions starting Friday, January 23, 2026.While the weather today remains fair to partly cloudy, a layer of cloud cover is gradually building up, signaling the arrival of a more humid and ""unpredictable"" stretch of the winter season.This atmospheric disturbance, influenced by a similar weak system in the upper atmosphere, means the desert's typical golden sunshine will be shared with patches of grey.While no severe storms are on the horizon, the pattern brings a welcome variety to the season, making it the perfect time to enjoy the outdoors before the humidity levels spike overnight.If you’ve been waiting for a reason to use your umbrella, the weeknd might provide a light opportunity. The NCM has indicated that cloud cover will increase further by Saturday night and Sunday, particularly over coastal and northern areas.There is a tangible chance of light rainfall during this period, especially over the islands and coastal regions.Temperatures are varying significantly depending on where you are in the country.Coastal areas like Dubai and Abu Dhabi are seeing pleasant highs of 19°C to 24°C, while internal regions might hit 25°C.However, the real ""winter"" is happening in the mountains, where daytime temperatures struggle to pass 16°C and nighttime lows have been recorded as low as 5°C to 9°C.Earlier this week, Jebel Jais even recorded a seasonal low of 0.2°C, proving that the UAE's winter ""nip"" is very real.Yes, but rainfall today is more likely to be light rather than heavy. The NCM’s forecast indicates that scattered showers might develop, especially over northern emirates and along the coast.In recent days, light rain has already been observed in parts of the country, and temperatures dipped slightly, a pattern consistent with weak cloud systems passing through.This does not currently suggest widespread storms or heavy downpours, just a gentle wetting rain that may interrupt outdoor plans briefly.One of the most immediate impacts of this weather shift is the rising humidity.Forecasters expect humidity to surge overnight and into Saturday morning, particularly in western areas.This increase often leads to mist or fog formation during the early hours, which can significantly reduce visibility for morning commuters.To ensure a safe weekend, residents are encouraged to:This change in weather serves as a reminder of the unique beauty of a UAE winter.

UAE child digital safety law 2026

Ensuring children only use apps and games suited for their specific age group.



Utilizing parental control tools to block access to adult or harmful materials.



Preventing children from sharing sensitive personal data or the private information of others.



Reporting any digital threats or grooming attempts to the relevant UAE authorities immediately.

Fines for neglect



Looking ahead





In a groundbreaking move to protect the youngest members of society, the UAE has officially enacted the Child Digital Safety Law, a regulation that shifts the focus of online safety from tech companies directly to the home.Under this new legal framework, parents and legal guardians are now held legally accountable for the digital footprints and online activities of their children. This isn't just a set of guidelines; it is a formal recognition that the virtual world is as significant as the physical one.The United Arab Emirates has issued a new Federal Decree-Law on Child Digital Safety aimed at protecting children from online risks and harmful digital experiences. This law took effect on January 1, 2026 and represents one of the most comprehensive approaches to child online protection in the region. It applies not only to digital platforms but also to parents, caregivers and internet service providers.The move is part of the UAE’s broader strategy to make 2026 the “Year of the Family”, putting children’s well-being at the centre of digital policy and safety initiatives. The law outlines specific ""Digital Due Diligence"" that parents are expected to follow.It moves beyond simply checking a child's browser history and enters the realm of active prevention.Guardians are now required to ensure that children are not accessing age-inappropriate platforms, particularly social media apps that have strict 13+ or 16+ age limits. Parents must monitor for signs of cyber-harassment and take immediate action if their child is being targeted or, conversely, if their child is engaging in bullying behavior toward others.Key responsibilities under the new law include:Under the Federal Decree-Law No. 26 of 2025 on Child Digital Safety, the UAE has established a strict penalty structure to ensure that the ""Digital Due Diligence"" is taken seriously. While the law is currently in a grace period for full operational compliance, the legal framework for fines is already clear.Parents and guardians found in significant breach of their monitoring duties, such as allowing children under 13 to bypass age restrictions or ignoring evidence of digital grooming, face administrative fines that typically begin at AED 5,000 for initial instances of neglect.For more severe cases, the law integrates with the existing Wadeema Law, where ""digital abandonment"" can lead to much steeper financial hits. If a child’s safety is directly compromised due to a lack of parental oversight, fines can reach up to AED 50,000 to AED 100,000.Furthermore, repeat offenders or those who intentionally facilitate a child's access to harmful content may see these amounts doubled. Beyond just the money, the law empowers courts to mandate ""digital rehabilitation"" courses for parents, ensuring they gain the technical skills needed to protect their families moving forward.Staying on the right side of the law begins with activating parental controls across all home devices and ensuring that your children only access age-appropriate platforms, strictly avoiding the ""under-13"" social media trap. Make it a habit to perform a weekly digital check-in to monitor for signs of cyberbullying or contact from strangers, and always utilize the Safe Use filters provided by your UAE internet service provider.Most importantly, foster an environment of open communication where your children feel safe reporting suspicious activity, ensuring that your home remains a sanctuary of ""Mindful Digital Citizenship"" rather than a source of legal liability.","The United Arab Emirates has issued a new Federal Decree-Law on Child Digital Safety aimed at protecting children from online risks and harmful digital experiences.

This week, the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) reported that the mercury hit a bone-chilling 0.2°C on Jebel Jais.For a city built for 45°C summers, this cold snap has changed the way we live:The viral image itself is a masterclass in digital art, likely utilizing AI or high-level editing to show the world what Dubai would look like as a Nordic capital.It’s part of a larger trend where His Highness Sheikh Hamdan uses his platform to highlight the beauty and seasonal shifts of the city in a fun, relatable way.However, the weather scientists at the NCM remind us that while the photo is a fantasy, the Siberian High Pressure system is very real. These winds are pushing clouds across the country and keeping the sun from heating up the desert floor, making this one of the most sustained cold periods the UAE has seen in years. The NCM has even issued warnings about fierce winds, reminding everyone that this winter ""nip"" has some real power behind it.There is something about a cold morning that brings a community together. Whether it’s sharing a viral post from His Highness Sheikh Hamdan or huddling together at a weekend desert camp, the ""Fazza Snow"" photo has become a cultural moment. It reminds us that even in a city of sand and sun, there’s always room for a little winter magic. So, go ahead, wear that heavy coat you bought for your last trip to London. This week, you actually need it.","His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence (lovingly known as Fazza) posted a photo of the Burj Khalifa covered in snow.

"Abu Dhabi Dar​b toll scam alert: Fraudsters sending fake pending fees messages, what UAE residents must know",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/abu-dhabi-darb-toll-scam-alert-fraudsters-sending-fake-pending-fees-messages-what-uae-residents-must-know/articleshow/126978446.cms,"UAE Darb Toll Scam Alert: Drivers Warned of Fake SMS Messages

What are UAE drivers seeing? Fake “DARB alerts”



A supposed payment link with a web URL that looks official at first glance

A prompt to “Reply Y” to open a payment portal

A claimed overdue toll amount

The sender phone number was not from a UAE mobile network

The links did not use official government or Q Mobility domains

Recipients often reported they had no actual pending tolls

Official advice: Trust only Q Mobility’s approved channels



The official DARB App

The Darb website: darb.qmobility.ae

Approved government platforms such as TAMM

Any message that arrives from a random phone number, especially from an international code, should be treated as suspicious.

Why this UAE toll scam is on the rise

How the Darb toll system really works in the UAE



You must register your vehicle with the Darb toll management system to receive legitimate alerts about unpaid tolls or fines.

Registered vehicles are monitored automatically; toll charges are debited from your account or wallet within the official app or platform.

Official Darb alerts always appear via the app or authorised government SMS services, not from foreign or unrecognised numbers.

Tips to protect yourself from toll scams



Ignore Unknown Toll Alerts - If the toll message comes from an unfamiliar number or contains an unusual link, do not click it, even if the amount looks small. Check Your Payments Directly - Open the Darb app or visit the official website to see if there are legitimate pending charges or fines. Don’t Reply to Suspicious Messages - Responding to scam texts, even with “Y” as instructed, can trigger further scam activity or lead to phishing. Report Scam Messages - Forward the suspicious message to your carrier or mark it as spam; consider notifying local authorities or Q Mobility support. Learn Scam Signs - Scammers often use international numbers, grammar errors, URLs that resemble official domains but differ slightly, and urgent language warning of fines.

Fake Messages Sent by Darb Toll Scammers





Motorists across the UAE, especially in Abu Dhabi, have been warned about fraudulent messages lurking in text inboxes that claim to be official Darb toll alerts. These scam notifications say that drivers have pending Darb toll fees and urge them to click on a link or reply “Y” to settle fines quickly. However, authorities say that these are fake messages designed to trick people into clicking malicious links and potentially giving up personal or payment information.Prompted by a spike in user reports and online complaints, transport officials and cybersecurity experts are now sounding the alarm for drivers to remain vigilant and only use authorised government channels to check toll violations or make payments.In recent days, several UAE residents reported receiving SMS messages titled “DARB-Alert” claiming there are pending toll fees, often just a few dirhams and warning that a fine (typically Dh100) and points could be imposed if the fee isn’t paid “today.”The messages often include:However, when investigators looked at these messages, they found red flags:Similar patterns are being discussed across social media threads, with users warning each other not to click the links.One Dubai Reddit user noted the suspicious URL included spelling errors and a non-government “.com” address, something official toll notifications would never use.Q Mobility, the operator of Abu Dhabi’s Darb toll system and part of the Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company (ADQ) has repeatedly warned users to verify any message claiming to be from them. According to a recent social media post from the company, the only trusted channels for toll alerts and payments are:Q Mobility stressed that official notifications clearly identify themselves and never request responses like “Reply Y.” They also do not include unofficial URLs.Cyber scams of this kind are part of a broader trend of phishing and fake alert campaigns targeting UAE residents in recent years. Authorities including Abu Dhabi Police have actively run awareness campaigns like the “Be Cautious” initiative to educate the public about online fraud tactics, from deceptive links to phishing phone calls.These scam messages exploit urgency and fear, suggesting fines or legal penalties, to trick people into acting impulsively. That’s a common tactic in digital fraud, and law enforcement agencies caution against clicking unfamiliar links or providing sensitive personal or financial data.Similar warnings have been issued about traffic fine phishing emails in the UAE, where fraudsters use fake police logos and official-looking layouts to dupe people into clicking links to bogus payment pages.Understanding how the toll system functions sheds light on why you should not trust random messages:If you suspect you genuinely owe a toll payment, you should open the Darb app or log in to darb.qmobility.ae directly, not via a link in a text message.Here’s how residents are being advised to stay safe:With digital payments and e-services becoming the norm for tolls, parking and traffic fines, scams that mimic these systems can cause real harm, from financial loss to identity theft. Authorities across the UAE have consistently advised residents to verify all digital communications before acting.Abu Dhabi’s integrated transport technology continues to evolve, including paid parking integration through the Darb app and new traffic regulations to improve road flow and compliance. But the convenience of these services also attracts fraudsters looking to exploit public trust.Staying informed and cautious is essential to avoiding scams and ensuring that digital traffic services work as intended.",UAE drivers warned about fraudulent messages claiming to be official Darb toll alerts.

Special medical considerations for Ramadan 2026



Bottom line: Opt for a balanced, informed approach this Ramadan 2026







As Ramadan 2026 nears, millions around the world are preparing not only spiritually but physically for a month of dawn-to-sunset fasting. While fasting is a beloved religious observance, health experts emphasise that preparation and smart nutrition are crucial to maintaining wellbeing throughout the month. Combining insights from local doctors and reputable global health organisations, here is a trusted guide to help you fast safely and comfortably.Adequate hydration is one of the most important components of a successful fast. The World Health Organization (WHO) Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office specifically recommends drinking plenty of water (at least around 10 glasses) and eating hydrating foods such as soups and fresh fruits like watermelon and salads during non-fasting hours to compensate for fluids lost during the day. They also advise avoiding caffeinated drinks such as coffee, tea and cola because caffeine increases urination and can lead to dehydration.Cornell Health, the health and wellbeing service of Cornell University, echoes this and adds that one should drink fluids at regular intervals through the night and avoid consuming too much at once, as over-hydration in one go can dilute electrolytes.Skipping the pre-dawn meal (suhoor) can make fasting significantly harder.Nutrition experts from Cornell Health advise that suhoor should include a mix of whole grains, protein, healthy fats and fruits or vegetables to help sustain energy and keep blood sugar stable throughout the long fast. Examples include whole-grain cereals or toast with eggs, yogurt with fruit and nuts, or brown rice with vegetables.The WHO also recommends that suhoor be light but nutritious, particularly for groups who may be more vulnerable during fasting such as elderly adults, adolescents, pregnant or nursing women.Both WHO and international dietary guides emphasise the benefits of starting iftar (the evening meal that breaks the fast) with water and dates, a longstanding tradition rooted in health as well as faith. Dates provide natural sugars and a small energy boost while water immediately begins rehydrating the body after prolonged abstinence.This approach is supported by general Ramadan nutrition advice from organisations such as Fraser Health in Canada, which notes that dates and low-fat milk are a healthy way to break the fast and can help prevent abrupt blood sugar fluctuations that contribute to fatigue.Healthline, a respected medical and nutrition information site, recommends leaning into whole foods rich in fiber, lean proteins and healthy carbohydrates during iftar to replenish nutrients lost during the day and provide lasting energy through the night and into the next fast. Examples include vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, eggs, legumes and dairy.Their registered dietitians also emphasise moderation, eating mindfully at iftar and avoiding heavy, sugary, or high-fat foods that can cause indigestion and fatigue. Starting with water and a small date or fruit before main dishes helps control appetite and prevent overeating.Several health authorities recommend reducing caffeine intake in the week leading up to Ramadan. Research and expert advice from wellness organisations suggest that sudden withdrawal from habitual caffeine can lead to headaches and fatigue, symptoms many people misattribute to fasting itself. Gradually tapering coffee and tea before Ramadan can help your body avoid these issues once fasting begins.Moreover, WHO guidance clearly states avoiding caffeine during suhoor and non-fasting periods because it increases urine output and can exacerbate dehydration, something you want to minimise before long fasting hours.WHO and other health organisations encourage a balanced diet throughout Ramadan, composed of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and sufficient fluids, while limiting deep-fried, processed or high-sugar foods that contribute little nutrition and can lead to discomfort or weight gain.This aligns with Cornell Health’s advice on maintaining good nutrition: including vegetables, whole grains and healthy proteins at both suhoor and iftar to help manage hunger, energy levels, and overall health during the fast.While Ramadan is not usually a time for intense workouts during fasting hours, light movement and gentle exercise in the evening, such as walking or stretching, can support digestion and circulation, according to health advisors. Framing this within a balanced lifestyle helps preserve energy without risking dehydration or exhaustion.Sleep hygiene is also important because altered timetables can disrupt normal sleep cycles during Ramadan. Experts advise aiming for adequate rest (7–8 hours if possible) by incorporating naps and consistent sleeping schedules into your routine, which supports physical recovery throughout the fasting month.International health bodies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and dietetics professionals often emphasise that people with chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease or those on specific medications should consult a healthcare provider before fasting. Adjustments to meal timing, medication schedules and monitoring plans ensure safety and prevent complications.This is particularly relevant for individuals whose medical treatments require food or water intake at specific times and cannot be adjusted without professional supervision.Preparing your body for Ramadan fasting is not just about abstaining from food and drink during daylight hours. It is about planning smartly, hydrating fully, eating nutrient-dense meals and respecting your body’s needs. Strategies backed by the World Health Organization, Cornell Health and other recognised health authorities affirm that with proper preparation, most people can experience a safe, comfortable and fulfilling Ramadan.By following these evidence-based tips, from hydration and meal composition to rest and medical consultation, you can approach the holy month with both spiritual intention and physical wellbeing.",Ramadan 2026: Are You Ready to Fast Safely?

Why hundreds of bald eagles are flocking to northern British Columbia’s frozen mountains during winter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/why-hundreds-of-bald-eagles-are-flocking-to-northern-british-columbias-frozen-mountains-during-winter/articleshow/126672217.cms,"Source: X

Why British Columbia’s winter landscapes draw bald eagles together



Bald eagles and rare winter group behaviour



What winter eagle gatherings reveal to scientists







In the frozen mountains of northern British Columbia, there was the unusual occurrence of a rare incident in the wildlife scene where the bald eagles were gathered in their hundreds in one spot, and in the middle of winter. Against the background of mountains laden with snow and the icy river valley, the sight was quite outstanding and unusual. For bald eagles, which stand out in their status as symbols of freedom, power, and dominance in nature, it was highly unusual for them to congregate in such huge numbers because they were predominantly lone animals and territorial in their behaviour patterns. The severity of the weather seemed to have had a huge effect on the eagles, as only limited spaces were available and where their feeds were still accessible, forcing unprecedented gatherings that stunned researchers and local communities alike. Such rare congregations offer scientists valuable insight into how climate stress reshapes wildlife behaviour and survival strategies.The northern area of British Columbia is important to the wintering survival of bald eagles. Though much of this area will freeze, there will always be fast-moving rivers that are partially open, providing the eagles with readily available fish. Rivers that support salmon are usually connected, forming pathways to life-sustaining riverways.As winter approaches and the temperature cools, bald eagles from an increasingly vast area will migrate to these feeding grounds, and many will be seen in one small area.The harsh environment imposed by winter causes a shift in bald eagles' normal habits. The immobility brought by snow, the uninhabitability of lakes due to ice, and the shorter daylight hours make energy conservation essential. The habit of securing territories disappears, with eagles seeking locations close to food sources. The movement of prey through the snow-covered environment is predictable, helping the eagles modify their hunting patterns. What seems like a rare concentration of birds is, in actual fact, a decision based on survival that is influenced by the environment.In areas outside breeding colonies or feeding grounds, however, bald eagles tend to be alone. Adults do not compete with each other, particularly around feeding areas. To witness so many of them assemble at one place is a clear indication that their social norms have been temporarily overlooked. Experts say that it is possible only in areas where food is plentiful and accessible. In such areas, even though competition may be a disadvantage, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to observe their flexibility in handling their socialisation.The group behaviours exhibited during winter are very advantageous in several ways. The eagles can view each other in search of food, thus saving time looking for it in the frozen land. Additionally, the dominant eagles will either jump over the ice or find a source of food first as an indirect means of providing for the rest of the group members. The younger and weaker eagles are able to get protection by staying in a group, thus minimising the chances of starvation.Large winter gatherings offer a unique opportunity to study bald eagles under environmental stress. Scientists are able to estimate population size, age structure, feeding patterns, and social tolerance. It helps them to get an idea about the resiliency of the species towards extreme weather and habitat pressure. This kind of data is very crucial in view of changing climatic cycles that disturb food availability and migration behaviour in an ecosystem.The sight of hundreds of eagles in one place often plays the role of a sign of ecological vigour: healthy fish populations, undisrupted waterways, and preserved forest habitats. These aggregations are the natural barometers by which environmental health is spotlighted, emphasising those areas where ecosystems are healthy and working. Such observations also guide conservation planning, policy decisions, habitat restoration priorities, and long-term monitoring strategies across regions facing climate variability.","The sight of hundreds of bald eagles in one place is a sign of ecological vigour.

"Did Starmer impose a curfew in the UK? No, it's just a fake TikTok video",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/did-starmer-impose-a-curfew-in-the-uk-no-its-just-a-fake-tiktok-video/articleshow/126262276.cms,"Keir Starmer

Coup In Britain? Starmer’s ‘Own Cabinet Plots’ His Downfall | ‘Full Bunker Mode’ In No. 10





The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true. ""The UK is set to introduce a nationwide curfew, beginning at 11pm each night,"" he appears to say on one of thousands of TikTok videos of him posted in last six months. ""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok. By Dec 19, most appeared to have been removed from the platform. Howard said the use of AI in politics is increasing rapidly. ""We know it's internationally pervasive now,"" he said. ""Four of every five elections around the world now have AI-generated political junk that is unattributed and clearly misleading.

Explained: The SNL joke about Usha Vance being JD Vance's 'beard',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explained-the-snl-joke-about-usha-vance-being-jd-vances-beard/articleshow/127493951.cms,"‘Missile Fired At US’: Vance Drops New Greenland Bombshell | Why Trump Needs Control Of Arctic





This week’s Saturday Night Live cold open began with a parody awards ceremony called The Trumps, a familiar SNL device that reimagines the Oscars through the narcissistic logic of Donald Trump. The premise itself was broad and accessible: Trump hosting an awards night celebrating himself, his administration, and the institutions he claims to have bent to his will. As with most SNL cold opens, the sketch was designed to function on multiple frequencies at once, mixing easy political satire with sharper, culturally specific jokes aimed at audiences fluent in online discourse.One of those sharper moments arrived via a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameo by J. D. Vance, played by Mikey Day. In the sketch, Vance jokes that if he becomes president in 2028, he would be the first US president with a beard in a hundred years. Trump immediately snaps back: “Speaking of your ‘beard’, how is your wife Usha?”On the surface, the line registers as a typical Trump-style insult, a crude pivot from facial hair to marriage delivered for a quick laugh. But that surface reading misses what the joke is actually doing. The word “beard” is not accidental. It is a piece of queer terminology smuggled into a network television sketch, and its meaning is precise. In queer slang, a “beard” refers not to facial hair, but to a partner used as a heterosexual cover, historically by queer individuals who felt pressure to conceal their sexuality in hostile social or professional environments.That particular joke has circulated for years in online spaces, forming part of the same rumour ecosystem as the infamous JD Vance couch joke. The SNL line riffs on a long-circulating internet innuendo suggesting that Vance is queer and that Usha Vance functions as his “beard”. The show is not making a factual claim. Instead, it is exploiting a piece of subcultural vocabulary that many casual viewers will not recognise, while others will immediately understand the implication.This kind of layered humour is central to how SNL has survived in the social media era. The cold open has become less about telling a single joke clearly, and more about stacking references that travel well online. A line like this generates clips, screenshots, and explainers precisely because it splits the audience. If you do not know the slang, the joke passes as crude banter. If you do, it lands as a deliberately provocative wink, one that feels far more transgressive than the sketch otherwise suggests.The reason the joke works at all is because JD Vance’s personal life has already been folded into internet speculation in a way few mainstream politicians experience. JD and Usha Vance’s relationship has been the subject of unusually persistent gossip, much of it incubated in MAGA-adjacent online spaces where personal narratives are treated as ideological battlegrounds. While Usha Vance recently announced her fourth child, the internet briefly went into overdrive when she was spotted without her wedding ring, an absence her publicist dismissed as innocuous.That moment fed into a broader rumour cycle that has little regard for evidence but enormous appetite for symbolism. Around the same time, many online commentators, and even mainstream figures such as Joy Reid, amplified claims that JD Vance was preparing to “divorce” Usha Vance and instead marry a so-called “white queen”, Erika Kirk. The rumour drew on racial, ideological, and aesthetic anxieties within Trumpworld, casting Usha Vance as an inconvenient mismatch in a movement increasingly obsessed with cultural homogeneity.None of these claims have been substantiated. But in contemporary political culture, truth is often secondary to circulation. By the time SNL referenced the joke, it had already become part of the ambient background noise surrounding Vance’s public image, familiar enough to be recognisable, even if only to a niche audience.That is the ecosystem SNL now operates in. The show does not originate these narratives. It harvests them, compresses them, and refracts them through satire. In this case, a single word, “beard”, operates as a cultural dog whistle, quietly importing years of online rumour, queer slang, and political gossip into a five-second exchange. Most viewers will miss it. Some will laugh without knowing why. And a smaller group will recognise exactly what the joke is doing, and why it feels sharper, and crueller, than it first appears.","Saturday Night Live's The Trumps opened with Donald Trump hosting an awards ceremony.

It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

If you have any queries for Dhirendra Kumar you can drop us an email at: toi.business@timesinternet.in

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough. A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126072870,imgsize-47970,width-400,resizemode-4/saving-and-investing.jpg"

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.
