The resurfaced tweets and Josh Allen’s apology



The road forward for Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld

Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld’s marriage was expected to be one of the most glamorous celebrity-athlete unions of the year. Their wedding photos painted a picture of a fairytale romance — but celebrations quickly collided with controversy. Old tweets from Allen’s teenage years resurfaced, sparking renewed debate about accountability, personal growth, and how much the past should define public figures.Among the most damaging posts was the statement: “If it ain’t white, it ain’t right.” The tweets, made when Allen was 14 or 15, initially resurfaced back in 2018 but gained traction again during the wedding.Allen had already apologized to ESPN, saying: “I’m in a panic…I apologize for what I did… That is not who I am.” He explained that some tweets were immature attempts to mimic lyrics or jokes, while others may have come from friends using his phone. Still, the phrasing and tone stirred backlash.Fans and analysts remain split. Some argue the quarterback should not be endlessly punished for mistakes made as a teenager, especially after public apologies and years of clean conduct. Others believe that such comments reveal underlying attitudes that demand more direct confrontation.Within the NFL , several teammates have spoken up for Allen’s character, noting that his actions as a leader show growth, while critics caution against excusing harmful words simply because of athletic talent.For Allen and Steinfeld, this controversy tests how they will navigate scrutiny as a high-profile couple. Many believe the quarterback has an opportunity to go beyond apologies — using his platform to promote dialogue, education, and anti-racism initiatives.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld stuns fans in chocolate brown leather outfit as Josh Allen prepares for the NFL season If handled thoughtfully, the couple could turn a negative moment into one that underscores accountability and maturity, reshaping the narrative around their wedding.","Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld's wedding quickly collided with controversy.

Antonio Brown has once again turned to social media to make headlines, this time by mocking Taylor Swift ’s loyal fanbase.

Instead of a clever critique, the meme reduces an entire fan community to an insulting punchline, one clearly designed to provoke both laughter and outrage.For Brown, this kind of online performance isn’t new. Over the years, he has used social media as a stage for antics that range from mocking rivals to taking aim at celebrities. The Swift meme fits the same pattern: a crude joke that guarantees immediate engagement. By making Swift’s massive fandom the subject, he ensures an avalanche of reactions — whether it’s fans defending their idol or critics condemning the disrespect.Beyond the insult, Brown’s post speaks to a larger cultural reality.

NBA pro Marcus Morris was handcuffed and had his ankles shackled by Florida police when he was arrested at an airport last month on suspicion of unpaid bills.According to the police body camera footage, which was made public by TMZ on Tuesday, an officer first told him that he wanted to remove him from his family so that the kids wouldn't have to witness his arrest. He co-operated and was handcuffed after being led around the bend from the gate.A new video reveals that Marcus Morris, a long-time NBA player, was not happy with the way police handled him after he was detained in Florida last month on fraud-related charges. TMZ Sports was able to secure new police footage that showed it.In the body camera footage, viewers can see Broward County Sheriff's Office deputies approaching Marcus Morris and his family as they wait at a gate at the airport. After removing him from the area and informing him that they would need to place him under arrest due to an outstanding warrant, they removed the shackles.They restrained his ankles after first cuffing his wrists and then placing him in a wheelchair.It was described to him as ""a new policy."" Eventually, police returned to Markieff, Morris' brother, and informed him of the situation.The NBA pro was then instructed to sit in a wheelchair in order to handcuff his legs. Then, feeling irritated, he said, ""Come on, bro."" After that, he was wheeled out of the airport and put in a police car.According to court filings, Marcus Morris was charged with making checks he knew would bounce in order to swindle two casinos in Las Vegas out of $265,000. He is accused of writing a fraudulent cheque to the MGM Grand in May 2024, and when the cheque bounced, he never reimbursed the money.A month later, he allegedly performed a similar stunt at the Wynn Las Vegas Hotel and Casino. Markieff, his brother, acknowledged on X that he had been arrested. He wrote:""The wording is crazy… Damn for that amount of money they’ll embarrass you in the airport with your family. They got y’all really thinking bro did some fraud s***. They could have came to the crib for all that. When y’all hear the real story on this s*** man. All I can say is Lesson learned. Bro will tell y’all tomorrow. This weird s*** gave me a headache. Can’t stop nothin!""Marcus Morris also posted a lengthy social media statement criticizing the treatment he received from Las Vegas government and the police.

Elon Musk is suing Apple and OpenAI, claiming that they have an anti-competitive arrangement that gives OpenAI's ChatGPT an unfair advantage on the iPhone. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Fort Worth, Texas, on behalf of Musk's companies X and xAI, seeks billions of dollars in damages. The suit argues that Apple's integration of OpenAI into its iOS operating system hinders competition and innovation in the AI industry and limits consumer choice.The lawsuit asserts that Apple's partnership with OpenAI makes it nearly impossible for other chatbot makers, including Musk's own Grok, to reach the top of the App Store charts. The legal action sets the stage for a major courtroom battle between Musk, one of the world's richest individuals, and Apple, one of the world's most valuable companies.The lawsuit follows Elon Musk's recent social media posts in which he questioned whether Apple was ""playing politics"" by not promoting his products. Apple responded that its App Store is ""fair and free of bias,"" while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman suggested Musk's complaints were a result of his own management style at X.Apple's collaboration with OpenAI involves integrating the most-downloaded free iPhone app in the U.S., ChatGPT, into its latest iPhones. The lawsuit claims this ""exclusive arrangement"" has made ChatGPT ""the only generative AI chatbot integrated into the iPhone,"" and that the companies have ""locked up markets to maintain their monopolies and prevent innovators like X and xAI from competing.""An OpenAI spokesperson called the lawsuit ""consistent with Mr. Musk’s ongoing pattern of harassment."" Apple has not yet commented on the lawsuit.This is not the first time Apple has faced legal challenges over its App Store. The company has a history of tangling with regulators and companies like Epic Games over claims its app store illegally squelches competition. The allegations in Elon Musk's lawsuit also mirror those brought by the U.S. Justice Department, which sued Apple in March 2023 for allegedly monopolizing the smartphone market. The government's suit claimed Apple used its power to block ""super apps"" that would make it easier for consumers to switch phones, an argument similar to Musk's claim that Apple's conduct inhibits the growth of ""everything apps"" like X.In addition to monetary damages, Elon Musk's lawsuit seeks a court order to end the alleged ""illegal arrangement.""However, the nature of Apple's deal with OpenAI is a point of contention. In court testimony from an unrelated case, Apple's senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue, said the partnership is non-exclusive and Apple is free to integrate other AI apps.","Elon Musk is suing Apple and OpenAI, claiming they have an anti-competitive arrangement that gives OpenAI's ChatGPT an unfair advantage on the iPhone.

'America will lead again in AI': Melania Trump rolls out national challenge for kids — here’s the catch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/america-will-lead-again-in-ai-melania-trump-rolls-out-national-challenge-for-kids-heres-the-catch/articleshow/123529131.cms,"Trump Drama At Vanity Fair? Staff Furious At Proposed Melania Cover, Threaten Mass Resignations

US First Lady Melania Trump is stepping into the tech spotlight, launching a national program to get children thinking about artificial intelligence. But while the initiative comes with lofty promises, it’s short on details, and that’s the catch.On Tuesday, the First Lady’s office announced the President’s Artificial Intelligence Challenge, inviting students from kindergarten through 12th grade to take part. “This will be the first step in preparing our next generation with a base understanding of this important new technology,” Melania said in a statement.In a video posted to her X account, she tied the launch to her personal experience of using AI to produce the audiobook of her memoir Melania. “As someone who created an AI-powered audiobook and championed online safety through the Take It Down Act, I’ve seen firsthand the promise of this powerful technology,” she said. “Just as America once led the world into the skies, we are poised to lead again, this time in the age of AI. ”What the challenge will actually involve, however, remains vague. The announcement offered no specifics on what students will be asked to do, or how the program will be run.Melania, who has no formal background in technology, is also expected to play an undefined role in the initiative.Still, she has shown a growing interest in digital issues. In addition to her AI audiobook, she backed the Take It Down Act, which requires platforms to remove non-consensual intimate images, including AI-generated ones, within two days.Since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, Melania has kept a low profile, spending much of her time in New York where her son Barron is at university. This new initiative marks one of her first high-profile moves in the second Trump presidency, though for now, the details remain as elusive as the technology she’s embracing.","US First Lady Melania Trump is launching a national program to get children thinking about artificial intelligence.

Prince Andrew Snaps At Staff After Man Reads Aloud Extract From Controversial Biography 'Entitled'

What the law actually allows

Royal Lodge context (often bundled into the rumors)

Where public opinion sits

What could change in the next reign

A new sovereign could:

Maintain the 2022 limits;

Tighten style/usage via letters patent (e.g., continued non-use of HRH); or

Ask ministers to explore legislation if removing a peerage were desired.

Bottom line

Facts today:

Talk has picked up again about what happens to Prince Andrew’s titles in the next reign. Several outlets claim Prince William wants a tougher line and could look at further steps once he is king. There is no official plan on record; the stories rely on unnamed sources and remain unconfirmed.In January 2022, Buckingham Palace announced that the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages were returned to the Queen and that he would not undertake public duties; at the same time, briefings confirmed he would no longer use the HRH style in an official capacity. He remains Duke of York and holds no front-line duties. None of that has changed.Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and, in some tellings, press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge. None of this has been announced; it is framed as a possibility, not a decision.A dukedom is a peerage, which is a legal dignity. Removing a peerage requires an Act of Parliament; the House of Lords Library is explicit on this point. The last time Parliament provided a mechanism to strip titles was the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, drafted for wartime enemies, hardly a ready tool for modern scandal.Any fresh action would almost certainly need new legislation.By contrast, styles (like HRH) sit within the sovereign’s power to define by letters patent, hence the 1917 letters patent that limited who is HRH. Using letters patent to refine style/usage is established; using them to annul a peerage would collide with statute and convention. In practice, government-backed legislation is the clean route for removing a dukedom.Prince Andrew holds a 75-year Crown Estate lease on Royal Lodge dating from 2003. Changing his residence would be a landlord-tenant and lease issue, not a simple royal edict. Reporting about pressure to move has see-sawed, but the legal baseline is the lease itself.Recent polling shows strong support for going further: 67% of Britons say Andrew should be stripped of his remaining titles; only 13% are opposed. That mood is real but policy still comes down to law and process.Any move to remove a dukedom would prompt debates on due process, precedent, and where to draw the line for other peers.Andrew does not use HRH, holds no military roles or active patronages, and retains the Duke of York title. Any further step is not something a monarch can do “on a whim”; it would almost certainly require Parliament. Until a legal route exists and is pursued, this remains talk, not policy.","Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge.

"Movement signatures: How we move, gesture, use facial expressions is unique; could be as different as fingerprint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/movement-signatures-how-we-move-gesture-use-facial-expressions-could-be-as-unique-as-fingerprint/articleshow/123483187.cms,"



MANCHESTER: The way someone walks, talks, smiles, or gestures gives a clue to who they are. Whether through the flick of an eyebrow, the rhythm of our walk, or the tilt of a head, movement speaks volumes.And my recent paper shows that people may have their own movement fingerprint. This is a style of movement that is characteristic of a person's identity. So, someone who uses expressive facial gestures might also speak with animated hand movements or walk with a lively gait. These consistencies could form a motion fingerprint that is unique to the individual.First, let's explore how faces move and why this matters.Everyone has their own style of moving their face, for example, how they raise an eyebrow, purse their lips, or squint when laughing. These patterns of movement help us recognise familiar people even when the visual quality is poor, such as in low lighting or from a distance. And as a person becomes more familiar to us, we become tuned to the way they move, learning their unique patterns of motion, just like we remember their face or voice.Human faces are constantly in motion; they blink, smile, grimace and talk, to name a few movements. Researchers categorise facial motion into rigid movements (such as turning or nodding the head) and non-rigid movements (like expressing emotion or speaking). It's the non-rigid movements that tend to be most personally distinctive.The way we gesture with our hands, shift our posture and tilt our heads all carry identity information. Gestures are often shaped by personal habits or cultural norms; for example, someone might habitually nod three times when agreeing, or use a distinctive hand wave common in their home country.Facial movements are synchronised with the way we sound. When we talk, our face plays a role in shaping the sound of our voice. For example, if you talk with a wide open mouth, your speech sounds deeper and richer. Studies show that people can match other people's voices to moving faces more accurately than to static ones. This suggests that dynamic cues to identity are present in the movement of the face and the sound of the voice.People with face recognition difficulties (those who are ""face blind"" or prosopagnosic) may be better at recognising moving faces than still ones. Typically, people who are face blind can see faces and the differences between them, but struggle to link the face to a specific person. Here, idiosyncratic information from movement can provide an additional clue to identity.Gait, a person's walking style, is one of the most studied body movements. Early research, such as a 2005 study, investigated participants' recognition of identity from gait using point-light displays. In this case, bright spots (lights) were placed on key areas of a person's body. All other visual cues were removed. Participants could only see bright spots against a dark background. The study found participants could tell fairly well who someone was from the way the spots moved.Characteristics such as stride length, limb movement, posture and pace form a consistent motion pattern that is unique and surprisingly difficult to fake, making gait analysis a reliable clue for identifying people.Movement fingerprintsMy review brought together evidence from behavioural and brain imaging studies to consider if such consistencies between different types of motion exist and how we might explore this phenomenon further. The paper proposes that people have an overall style of movement.More work needs to be done to find direct evidence of movement fingerprints. For example, we still aren't sure what part of the brain processes these movement-based identity cues.So far, research shows that the posterior temporal sulcus - an area of the brain located roughly above your ear on each side - responds not just to faces and bodies, but to how someone moves more generally. This area is active when we hear voices or see people speak, suggesting it may help link motion and sound. Also, this region plays a key role in allowing us to understand our social world, interpreting other people's actions, determining where they are looking, and picking up on social cues such as gestures, facial expressions and changes in gaze direction.However, it's probably just one part of a larger brain network involved in recognising others through motion.Real-world applicationsMotion-based identity traits aren't as stable or specific as fingerprints or DNA. They're what researchers call soft biometrics: useful but not always accurate.But as we better understand the link between motion and identity, exciting real-world applications are emerging.Motion analysis could support contactless identity verification from gait-based authentication at airports to gesture-based identification in smart environments, such as homes that respond to a user's unique movement patterns. In clinical settings, movement analysis might help support people with social cognition impairments, face recognition or movement issues. For example, helping a doctor identify changes in the way a patient produces non-verbal cues.But many questions remain. We still aren't sure how consistent motion fingerprints are as someone gets older and in different contexts. Individual differences in people and environmental factors like lighting, clothing or stress could affect them.Researchers also aren't sure how exactly we manage to understand all this movement in everyday life without even thinking about it.Figuring this out could not only help improve technologies like social robots and develop tools for people with recognition and communication difficulties, but also tell us more about how we process and react to other people.

Britain agrees to drop mandate for Apple to provide 'back door',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-agrees-to-drop-mandate-for-apple-to-provide-back-door/articleshow/123395824.cms,"Representative Image





SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain dropped a request for Apple to create a tool to give law enforcement access to customers' cloud data.

HUMAIN, as a company, is developing full-stack AI capabilities across four verticals:

Next-generation data centers High-performance infrastructure and cloud platforms Advanced AI models, including multimodal and sector-specific solutions Transformative AI tools for public and private sector innovation

Saudi Arabia has launched HUMAIN Chat, a conversational AI app developed entirely within the Kingdom, marking a major milestone in the region’s artificial intelligence ambitions. Backed by the Public Investment Fund (PIF) and built on the ALLAM 34B large language model, the platform is designed to serve Arabic speakers with linguistic accuracy, cultural relevance, and sovereign data control.HUMAIN Chat is the debut product from HUMAIN, a fully owned subsidiary of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. The company was established in May 2025 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman with the strategic aim of positioning Saudi Arabia as a global hub for artificial intelligence — with a specific focus on Arabic-language capabilities.The launch of HUMAIN Chat signals Saudi Arabia's entry into the global AI landscape with a sovereign, culturally grounded, and technologically advanced offering. The app is powered by ALLAM 34B, HUMAIN’s flagship Arabic large language model, which the company describes as the most advanced Arabic AI model ever developed.Initially available across iOS, Android, and web platforms, the application has been rolled out first in Saudi Arabia, with a regional expansion across the Middle East and a global release planned thereafter.According to CEO Tareq Amin (formerly of Rakuten Symphony), HUMAIN Chat represents a “historic milestone” in building AI that reflects Saudi values, infrastructure, and talent. He emphasized that this launch is only the beginning of a long-term journey to develop AI solutions that serve both regional and global users.ALLAM 34B stands at the core of HUMAIN Chat. This large language model has been developed from the ground up in Saudi Arabia, involving over 120 AI specialists, including 35 Ph.D.-level researchers and a team balanced in gender (50% women). The model was trained on one of the largest Arabic datasets ever compiled and then refined with input from over 600 domain experts and 250 evaluators.The app is built not only to be linguistically accurate but also to reflect Islamic, Middle Eastern, and local cultural contexts — filling a long-standing gap in generative AI for Arabic speakers.The development of ALLAM 34B builds on earlier models from the National Center for AI under the Saudi Data & AI Authority (SDAIA). According to an independent evaluation by Cohere on MMLU benchmarks, ALLAM 34B is now considered the most advanced Arabic LLM produced in the Arab world.The model is bilingual by design but prioritizes Arabic, aiming to serve over 400 million Arabic speakers and 2 billion Muslims globally — a user base historically underserved by mainstream generative AI tools.By combining technical sophistication with cultural sensitivity, HUMAIN Chat seeks to deliver a solution that empowers users to create, learn, and connect in their own linguistic and cultural context.CEO Tareq Amin stressed the symbolic and strategic significance of the release:“We are proving that globally competitive technologies can be rooted in our own language, infrastructure, and values — built in Saudi Arabia by Saudi talent.”HUMAIN Chat is the first release under HUMAIN IQ, a suite of AI-driven products and services that the company plans to expand globally. This initiative reflects Saudi Arabia’s ambition not just to adopt AI but to shape its evolution — with a focus on IP leadership, homegrown talent, and sector-specific AI applications.These initiatives are intended to drive exponential value, economic diversification, and technological sovereignty.The company emphasized that HUMAIN Chat will continue to evolve through user interaction, improving its performance and relevance with real-world usage. It has called on Saudi citizens and Arabic speakers globally to adopt the platform, contribute to its growth, and help shape the future of Arabic AI.","HUMAIN Chat, powered by ALLAM 34B, supports Arabic dialects, bilingual chat, and real-time search.

Planning your pedestrian friendly trip to Fes

Walking through Morocco’s Medina of Fes is like stepping into another world, one where cars and buses have no place, and life flows entirely on foot. Recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world’s largest car-free urban area, this pedestrian-friendly city has been home to generations for centuries. With winding alleys, bustling souks, and breathtaking Islamic architecture, Fes offers a cultural journey unlike any other. Here, donkeys replace traffic, artisans continue age-old crafts, and travellers experience a calmer, healthier, and more sustainable way of life in Morocco’s spiritual and cultural heart.Walking is one of the most rewarding ways to experience a destination. Unlike cars or buses, being on foot allows you to slow down, take in the atmosphere, and interact with the culture at street level. While many global cities are working towards becoming more pedestrian-friendly, Morocco’s Medina of Fes has already perfected it. Recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records, this medieval walled city holds the title of the largest car-free urban area in the world, where over 156,000 people live without cars, surrounded by centuries of history.The Medina of Fes dates back to the 13th century and has long been considered Morocco’s cultural and spiritual heart.With its maze-like alleys, bustling souks, and exquisite architecture, the medina offers an unmatched pedestrian-friendly environment. The only “traffic” you will encounter here are donkeys, handcarts, and streams of people wandering through colourful markets. This unique design not only preserves the old-world charm of the city but also creates a healthier, quieter, and more sustainable way of life. Visitors can explore historic monuments, enjoy local cuisine, and experience traditional crafts without the stress of vehicles, making walking through Fes an immersive and leisurely cultural adventure.The pedestrian-friendly nature of Fes has helped protect its cultural significance and community spirit. Walking through the medina is like stepping back in time, narrow streets are lined with stalls selling spices, textiles, ceramics, and handcrafted copperware. Local artisans, from weavers to potters, continue traditions that have been passed down for generations. It is no surprise that UNESCO has listed the Medina of Fes as a World Heritage Site, recognising its importance to global cultural heritage.The city is not just about shopping and sightseeing. Each year, Fes hosts cultural celebrations such as the Festival of World Sacred Music, filling the squares and courtyards with performances from international artists. Cafés and rooftop restaurants like Mom’s Touch and Ruined Garden offer spaces to relax while enjoying authentic Moroccan cuisine, considered among the finest in the world. This unique blend of history, art, music, and food makes the medina more than just pedestrian-friendly—it is a living, breathing cultural hub.To make the most of your visit, guided tours are widely available. Local experts lead travellers through the hidden corners of the medina, explaining its history while pointing out the best spots for shopping, dining, and photography. Whether through an organised group or a personalised experience via platforms like Airbnb, exploring Fes with a guide ensures you don’t miss the many treasures tucked into its labyrinthine streets.Getting to Fes is part of the adventure. The city is easily accessible by train from Tangier, Rabat, or Casablanca, thanks to Morocco’s efficient national railway system, the Office National des Chemins de Fer. The journey itself is scenic, giving travellers a glimpse of Morocco’s varied landscapes before arriving at the city’s historic gates. Once inside the medina, prepare to walk, the experience is entirely pedestrian-friendly, so comfortable footwear is essential.What makes Fes so appealing is how its pedestrian-friendly design shapes the visitor experience. Without the chaos of cars, the medina feels calmer and safer for exploration. Streets that might otherwise be congested with vehicles are instead filled with the sounds of merchants calling out, the aroma of street food, and the chatter of residents going about their daily routines. Travellers can wander freely, stop to chat with artisans, or simply admire the intricately tiled doorways and minarets that rise above the cityscape.For those seeking authentic cultural immersion in a setting where walking is the main mode of transport, the Medina of Fes is unparalleled. It stands as a living example of how pedestrian-friendly urban design can enhance community life, protect heritage, and offer visitors an unforgettable travel experience.","Moroccan city of Fes is the world’s largest car-free urban area.

What’s next?

Partial Lunar Eclipse: July 6, 2028 — a portion of the Moon will pass through Earth’s shadow

Next Total Lunar Eclipse visible from UAE: December 31, 2028 — coinciding with New Year’s Eve, offering another spectacular display

A dramatic and unusually long total lunar eclipse will light up the skies above the UAE on the night of September 7, 2025, turning the Moon a deep red during an 82-minute totality — one of the longest such events in recent years. The eclipse, visible across much of the globe, will offer residents and global viewers a rare chance to witness a breathtaking astronomical display, with public events and global livestreams planned.On September 7, 2025, the UAE will experience a total lunar eclipse, an event in which the Earth positions itself precisely between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow fully across the lunar surface. This alignment causes the Moon to turn a red, copper, or orange hue — a phenomenon popularly known as the Blood Moon.This reddish color results from sunlight being refracted through Earth's atmosphere, which filters out shorter blue wavelengths and allows the longer red tones to reach the Moon’s surface.What makes this eclipse especially notable is the length of totality, lasting a full 82 minutes, and the overall eclipse duration of nearly five and a half hours, one of the longest in recent memory. According to the Dubai Astronomy Group (DAG), the event is not only rare for its duration but also for its global visibility, potentially viewable by 87% of the world’s population.The lunar eclipse will unfold gradually through several distinct phases. Each stage offers a different visual experience, and residents in the UAE will be able to observe the entire sequence clearly:The most visually dramatic moment, totality, will occur between 9:30 PM and 10:53 PM, when the Moon is fully engulfed in Earth’s umbra and glows with intense red shades depending on atmospheric conditions.For the public, the Dubai Astronomy Group will organize a special viewing event in Dubai, allowing residents and tourists to gather and witness the phenomenon together. Details about the event venue and activities are expected to be announced soon. A standout moment will be a carefully planned photo opportunity: a Blood Moon rising behind the Burj Khalifa, captured in collaboration with renowned photographer Rami Dibo.To ensure global accessibility, DAG will also host a livestream of the full eclipse. The broadcast will feature:This global streaming effort aims to bring together astronomy enthusiasts worldwide for a shared celestial experience.Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are safe to view with the naked eye — no protective glasses or filters are needed. However, for those wanting an enhanced viewing experience, DAG recommends the following:If you miss this eclipse, there are a few more chances in the coming years:","On September 7, 2025, the UAE will witness an 82-minute total lunar eclipse, turning the Moon a vivid red.

Dubai Police has taken a significant leap in modernising public services by opening a new Smart Police Station (SPS) in Dragon Mart. With this move, Dubai further strengthens its status as a global leader in AI-driven governance, offering residents and visitors 24/7 access to fully automated, human-free policing services—now across 27 locations.Smart Police Stations (SPS) are a first-of-their-kind innovation in the Middle East. These self-service, unmanned stations operate entirely without physical police personnel. Accessible 24/7, they provide a fast, contactless, and secure alternative to traditional policing setups.Each SPS enables users to complete essential police services digitally—via a simple, secure process that begins with ID verification using either an Emirates ID (for residents) or a passport (for visitors), followed by mobile number authentication via SMS. For services requiring interaction, users are connected through a video interface to an on-duty officer, with on-site access to facilities like scanners and printers to complete paperwork.Once a transaction is completed, users receive a reference number via SMS and receipt, allowing for easy tracking as requests are routed to the appropriate police departments for further action.Services are accessible in seven languages—Arabic, English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, and Chinese—reflecting Dubai’s multicultural population and making processes user-friendly for both locals and international visitors.Dubai’s SPSs offer a broad suite of 45 fully digital services, organised under four main categories:Since launching the world’s first SPS in City Walk in 2017, Dubai has continuously expanded its smart policing infrastructure. The network now includes 27 fully operational SPS locations—ranging from central commercial areas to suburban and residential districts.In 2018, a walk-in model of SPS was introduced at Arabian Ranches to expand accessibility. By 2023, plans were set in motion for a floating SPS at the World Islands, showcasing the innovative trajectory of Dubai’s policing model.Dubai’s SPS framework has drawn global attention, with police commanders from several countries studying its implementation as a future model for digitised public security services.The SPS initiative directly supports the UAE’s national artificial intelligence strategy, which aims to future-proof government systems, increase digital readiness, and enhance public service efficiency.Under the directives of Lieutenant General Abdullah Khalifa Al Marri, Commander-in-Chief of Dubai Police, the rollout of smart police stations is being actively expanded to cover commercial and residential zones across the emirate.Major General Khalid Nasser Al Razooqi, Director of the General Department of Artificial Intelligence at Dubai Police, emphasised that these smart centres are a critical part of Dubai’s vision to become the world’s smartest city. He noted that digital transactions now account for 89.6% of all police service interactions—a testament to public adoption and operational efficiency.","Dubai Police has taken a significant leap in modernising public services by opening a new Smart Police Station (SPS) in Dragon Mart.

Kuwait’s Communications and Information Technology Regulatory Authority (CITRA) has temporarily blocked the online game Roblox, following mounting public complaints and concerns for child safety.

These reportedly include unsafe behavior, exposure to unwanted content, electronic exploitation, and risky in-game purchases. The platform’s popularity among children further heightened parental anxiety.Authorities found Roblox to provide an enabling environment for harassers and exploiters, in part due to its unrestricted chat and communications features. Concerns also include the presence of inappropriate themes, promotion of intellectual deviations, and content deemed inconsistent with Kuwait’s religious and moral values.The ban is described as temporary, pending:Several Gulf countries like Qatar, Oman and nations including China and Turkey have already enacted similar bans citing related concerns.

A chatty parrot with a knack for drug slang has helped British police crack down on a prison drug ring, squawking its way into an unlikely role in a major narcotics bust, authorities revealed this week.The Lancashire Constabulary filed charges against 15 individuals connected to the gang, which purportedly distributed drugs across Blackpool, England, from February 2023 to July 2024. The operation was orchestrated by 35-year-old Adam Garnett whilst serving a prison sentence, Fox News reported.The case unfolded after prison staff discovered multiple mobile phones and Wi-Fi routers during a search of Garnett's cell. This finding led investigators to his alleged associates, including Dalbir Sandhu, Shannon Hilton and Jason Gerrand.Subsequent home searches revealed heroin, crack cocaine, ketamine, cannabis, substantial cash amounts and mobile phones connected to drug trafficking A notable discovery came from Hilton's phone, containing recordings of her parrot ""Mango"" repeating ""two for 25,"" believed to be drug transaction terminology.Additional footage showed the bird interacting with money allegedly obtained through illegal activities.Video:""What's the most talented thing your pet can do? Sit? Give paw? How about speak?"" Lancashire Police wrote in a post on the department's Facebook page.""One drug dealer's parrot learned to say 'two for 25' - a phrase picked up as part of common language used by the organised crime gang run by her boyfriend. Not a phrase you want your parrot squawking when the police come knocking!""Investigators uncovered video communications between Hilton and Garnett, including footage displaying kilogram-sized cocaine packages, occasionally accompanied by drug-referencing song lyrics.Despite his imprisonment, Garnett reportedly maintained central control, directing evidence concealment efforts and maintaining communication with virtually all network members.Det. Sgt. Anthony Alves of Lancashire Police's West Targeted Crime Team commended the results, describing it as a ""coordinated and complex drug operation that extended far beyond prison walls.""""Garnett continued to run his enterprise while incarcerated, using illegal devices to maintain control. I want to thank my team, our partners at the Crown Prosecution Service, and our prosecution team for their dedication to bringing these criminals to justice.""He noted that warrants remain active for Chloe Stott and Ryan Black, requesting public assistance in locating them.Police reported additional evidence from suspects' devices included videos displaying large cash sums, drug-themed rap lyrics and documented narcotic transactions.Garnett received an additional 19 years and six months imprisonment, consecutive to his existing 15-year sentence. Hilton, 29, received 12 years whilst Sandhu, 41, was given 10 years.The operation formed part of Operation Warrior, Lancashire Police's initiative targeting organised crime, drug trafficking, exploitation and violence. Police and Crime Commissioner Clive Grunshaw supported the initiative and praised the results.""This sends a clear message: we will not tolerate organized crime in our communities.

She’s just doing her thing.”Fans noticed that both shows feature garden scenes, casual kitchen chats, and celebrity guests. Anderson’s trailer came out in October 2024. Markle’s teaser followed three months later. Online threads pointed to similar camera angles and even matching font styles in the titles. Some viewers accused the Duchess of releasing a “frame-for-frame” copy.Pamela’s Cooking With Love is streamed on Amazon Prime. Episodes show Anderson and a guest chef picking vegetables in her Vancouver garden before cooking a meal outdoors. Markle’s eight-part Netflix show centres on simple dishes and home-grown produce in Montecito.Both series mix recipes with lifestyle tips, but Anderson stressed that overlap is normal in food television.Anderson told Cohen she had only seen quick clips of Markle’s programme and did not spend time looking for likenesses. She joked that there is room for anyone who wants to share food and stories on screen. Her relaxed tone cooled much of the online debate.With Love, Meghan drew mixed-to-negative reviews (≈38% on Rotten Tomatoes; 37 on Metacritic). It briefly entered Netflix’s Top 10 in its first week, and mid-year engagement tallies cited by several outlets place it outside Netflix’s Top 300. Even so, Netflix has ordered Season 2.Anderson’s series has earned strong notices and a high user score on IMDb. Executive producer Jesse Fawcett said any comparison is a compliment because it proves their team set a trend others want to follow. Anderson plans to film a second garden season next spring.Markle has not commented on Anderson’s remarks. Sources close to her say she is focused on shooting new episodes and expanding her As Ever lifestyle brand. Observers doubt she will address copy-cat talk directly. They note she has stayed silent through similar critiques from Martha Stewart and Gwyneth Paltrow.Two stars can host cooking shows without a feud. Anderson’s light answer suggests she sees no threat. Unless Markle fires back, the story may cool as fast as it boiled up. For viewers, the choice is simple: prime-time garden meals with Pamela or California comfort food with Meghan. Either way, dinner is served.",Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.
