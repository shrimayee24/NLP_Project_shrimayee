Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu on Arattai app dropping out of top 100 list: ‘I literally told our employees…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zoho-founder-sridhar-vembu-on-arattai-app-dropping-out-of-top-100-list-i-literally-told-our-employees/articleshow/125278324.cms,"Vembu: Zoho has long-term strategy









Zoho Corporation founder and CEO Sridhar Vembu has responded to his company's messaging app Arattai falling out of the top 100 apps list, calling it a normal part of business development and dismissing critics as wasting their time. In an interview with ANI, Vembu addressed questions about WhatsApp testing a feature that would allow users to message people on other platforms.“There's nothing going wrong. I think, first of all, the idea that something went wrong is what is wrong. It is a normal course of events. Nothing goes straight to the moon. You have to go through these ups and downs,” Vembu was quoted as saying.He emphasised that companies that survive maintain a long-term perspective.“The trick to companies that survive is they have a long-term view on this. In fact, I never thought The number one is anything big. In fact, I literally told our employees, this is a particular moment, it won't last,” he added.“That's why I simply don't pay attention. And the people who pay attention and making fun of this, they are wasting their time. That's all I'll say. We are not wasting time. I am sitting and we are sitting and focused on code.So I said, don't worry about it,” Vembu noted, pointing out that Zoho views Arattai as a five to 15-year project rather than a short-term venture.Vembu revealed that Zoho has worked on messaging technology for 10 years, making the recent ranking drop insignificant.“Our strategy in all this, the messaging is very core. And we have been working on it for 10 years. So this one month is nothing for us. We will continue this and we have a really strong app. It's getting stronger,” the cofounder was quoted as saying.The company plans frequent updates to improve Arattai. Vembu argued that credible competition is necessary to prevent monopolistic practices in the messaging app market.“If we don't have competition, you can't keep the monopolist honest. The only thing that keeps a monopolist honest is competition,” he said.While talking about end-to-end encryption of chats on Arattai, Vembu noted that the encryption feature has been implemented, however, it will take some more time for the updates to take effect.","Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu has responded to his company's messaging app Arattai falling out of the top 100 apps list.

Retail experience and purchase process at launch









Apple and Japanese fashion house ISSEY MIYAKE have jointly introduced iPhone Pocket, a 3D-knitted textile accessory designed to be worn or carried and to hold an iPhone plus other small everyday items. The product is described as a “piece of cloth” reimagined as a flexible pocket: its ribbed, open-knit fabric expands to enclose a device and lets users glimpse the display when stretched. iPhone Pocket is available in two strap lengths and multiple colours, and Apple frames it as a special-edition accessory that complements iPhone design and personal style. The launch is positioned as both a fashion collaboration and a product engineered for universal fit and everyday utility.iPhone Pocket is a singular, 3D-knitted construction developed by ISSEY MIYAKE in close collaboration with Apple Design Studio. Crafted in Japan, the textile draws inspiration from the brand’s iconic pleats and is intended to function as an additional, wearable pocket for iPhone and other “pocketable items” such as AirPods. The knit’s ribbed open structure allows the textile to expand and subtly reveal contents when stretched, while fully enclosing items when relaxed.Apple and ISSEY MIYAKE describe the material as engineered for both look and function, combining traditional craft with modern textile R&D.iPhone Pocket is a singular, 3D-knitted construction developed by ISSEY MIYAKE in close collaboration with Apple Design Studio.

The knit’s ribbed open structure allows the textile to expand and subtly reveal contents when stretched, while fully enclosing items when relaxed. Apple and ISSEY MIYAKE describe the material as engineered for both look and function, combining traditional craft with modern textile R&D.According to Apple, the iPhone Pocket is sized and structured to fit any iPhone model as well as small everyday items. The open knit expands to accommodate slightly bulkier contents and lets users peek at the iPhone display without removing the phone fully. Apple highlights multiple ways to use the accessory: handheld, attached to a bag, or worn on the body. The product is positioned as a fashion accessory as much as a utility item, emphasising styling and personal expression alongside practical carrying.Apple’s Newsroom states the iPhone Pocket was crafted in Japan and that its development and design unfolded through collaboration between ISSEY MIYAKE’s research and development teams and Apple Design Studio. The piece references ISSEY MIYAKE’s longstanding practice of pleating and textile innovation as the inspiration for the accessory’s knit structure. Apple quotes design leads from both organisations to underline the shared approach to simplicity, craftsmanship and adaptability.Apple positions iPhone Pocket as both fashion and function: the open knit and colour palette were explicitly selected to mix and match with iPhone finishes and to let users create personal combinations. Apple images show Pocket paired with iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone Air models in complementary colours. Practical use cases emphasised by Apple include carrying the iPhone and small items together, wearing the Pocket across the body for hands-free use, and tying it to other bags or accessories. Retail staff will assist customers in stores in selecting strap length and colour combinations.Apple’s announcement emphasises the crafted textile quality and the 3D-knitted construction, but does not publish a formal care guide in the Newsroom piece. Because iPhone Pocket is a textile accessory made in Japan using ISSEY MIYAKE’s knit techniques, consumers should expect typical fabric care considerations gentle handling, avoiding sharp objects, and following any care instructions included in product packaging or on Apple’s online product pages after purchase. For definitive care and warranty details, customers should consult Apple’s product page or in-store specialists at launch.Apple frames iPhone Pocket as a special-edition accessory that complements iPhone design language and expands how users carry and style their devices. The product is intended to sit alongside Apple’s existing accessory portfolio rather than replace protective cases: it emphasises wearability, textile design, and aesthetic pairing. Apple highlights the accessory’s ability to carry other small items (for example, AirPods) and to visually coordinate with iPhone finishes.Apple’s announcement lists the specific Apple Store locations where iPhone Pocket will be available at launch and notes that both online and in-store purchase options will be offered beginning November 14, 2025. Apple Specialists will help customers mix and match lengths and colours with their iPhone and demonstrate styling options. Customers outside the initial launch markets should monitor apple.com for availability updates.","iPhone Pocket is a 3D-knitted textile accessory designed to be worn or carried and to hold an iPhone plus other small everyday items.

In an era where AI reshapes industries at unprecedented speed, Udemy CEO Hugo Sarrazin argues that viewing degrees and skills as competing forces misses the point entirely—calling for ""cohabitation"" between traditional education and ongoing professional development. He dismisses as ""silly"" the notion that education received in one's early twenties will suffice for an entire career.The CEO emphasizes the need for ""ongoing, continuous evolution of the skills portfolio"" to remain adapted to evolving job markets. This perspective comes as Gen Z increasingly questions higher education's value amid rising unemployment rates for recent graduates.Sarrazin, who holds three degrees including two from Stanford, credits university with teaching him ""how to think""—a skill he considers timeless.Research supports this view, with bachelor's degrees yielding a 682% lifetime return on investment, though it takes approximately 11 years to recoup costs.The foundation gained from formal education serves as essential groundwork, but practical skills are required to maintain workplace relevance. Universities function as ""launching pads,"" Sarrazin explains, with subsequent success depending on skills development.Udemy's 2026 Global Learning & Skills Trends Report identifies adaptive skills—including judgment, curiosity, flexibility, and risk tolerance—as crucial yet underappreciated workplace traits. These capabilities enable professionals to ask the right questions, recognize when to use or pause AI tools, and anticipate broader impacts.LinkedIn data mirrors these findings, highlighting AI literacy, conflict mitigation, adaptability, process optimization, and innovative thinking as the fastest-growing essential skills.The message is clear: degrees open doors, but continuous learning keeps them open.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

What makes this Aurora event unique





Understanding the science behind the Northern Lights





How geomagnetic storms are classified





Tips to improve your chances of seeing the Northern Lights





Find a dark viewing spot far from city lights and face north for the best view. Light pollution can wash out faint auroras, so rural or elevated areas are ideal.

Use your smartphone camera as many modern phone cameras are more sensitive to light than the human eye and can detect faint auroras before they become visible.

Let your eyes adjust to the dark for at least 20 to 30 minutes and avoid looking at bright screens. This allows your vision to adapt to low light and makes it easier to spot subtle colour shifts in the sky.

Dress warmly because temperatures can drop significantly at night, especially in northern regions. Layered clothing, gloves, and hats are essential for comfort during long viewing periods.

Be patient. The Northern Lights are unpredictable and can appear suddenly. Staying outdoors for an extended period improves your chances of witnessing the spectacle.

What to do if you miss tonight’s display

The night sky across the United States is expected to dazzle millions as the Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, become visible in over twenty states from November 11 to 12, 2025. This rare spectacle is fueled by heightened solar activity, including several powerful solar eruptions that send charged particles hurtling toward Earth at incredible speeds. As these particles interact with the planet’s magnetic field, they create stunning displays of shifting light in shades of green, pink, and violet, dancing across the sky in dynamic, ever-changing patterns. The phenomenon, usually confined to polar regions, may reach as far south as states like Kansas and Virginia, offering a rare opportunity for Americans to witness one of nature’s most captivating and colourful celestial events.The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, are expected to dazzle skywatchers across the United States tonight, offering a rare opportunity for millions to witness one of nature’s most mesmerising displays. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), enhanced solar activity has created ideal conditions for auroral visibility, pushing the colourful phenomenon much farther south than usual.If weather conditions remain clear, shimmering curtains of green, pink, and violet light could illuminate the skies across multiple regions, from the Pacific Northwest to the Northeast. This widespread coverage marks one of the most extensive Northern Lights forecasts in recent years, making tonight a particularly exciting occasion for stargazers and photographers alike.Here’s the list of US states:Timing is crucial for observing the aurora borealis. NOAA’s three-day geomagnetic forecast predicts that activity will peak late in the evening and continue into the early hours of 12 November. The best viewing windows are expected to be between 4 pm and 10 pm EST (2100–0300 GMT) for minor to moderate activity, and between 10 pm and 1 am EST (0300–0600 GMT) for stronger geomagnetic storm levels.During these peak hours, observers may witness luminous arcs or shimmering curtains of light dancing across the northern horizon. In some areas, the lights could stretch overhead in glowing ribbons that shift and ripple as magnetic fields interact.The combination of multiple CMEs and an exceptionally powerful solar flare makes this event stand out from recent auroral displays. The convergence of these solar bursts increases the likelihood of intense geomagnetic disturbances. Such interactions can create stacked auroras, where layers of colour overlap, giving the sky an even richer appearance. The last time auroras of this strength reached similar latitudes was during strong solar events several years ago. Additionally, solar activity tends to rise and fall in roughly 11-year cycles known as solar cycles. We are currently nearing the peak of Solar Cycle 25, which explains the recent increase in both sunspots and flares that are the main drivers of auroral events, producing spectacular skies visible to many observers across high-latitude regions.The Northern Lights occur when streams of charged particles from the Sun, known as the solar wind, reach Earth and interact with gases in the upper atmosphere. These collisions release energy in the form of light, producing the stunning patterns that dance across the sky.Oxygen atoms are responsible for the green and red colours most commonly seen, while nitrogen produces blue and purple hues. The exact colours depend on which gases are hit and at what altitude the interactions take place.This week’s event is particularly special because several coronal mass ejections (CMEs), enormous bursts of plasma and magnetic energy from the Sun, are headed toward Earth. These CMEs are part of heightened solar activity linked to an X5.1-class solar flare, the most powerful flare recorded so far in 2025. When these charged particles collide with Earth’s magnetic field, they can cause strong geomagnetic storms, expanding the auroral oval and pushing the Northern Lights much farther south than usual.Geomagnetic storms are measured on a five-level scale from G1 (minor) to G5 (extreme). These classifications are determined by the strength of the disturbance in Earth’s magnetic field.A G3 storm is strong enough to make auroras visible at mid-latitudes, while a G4 storm can extend the visibility range even farther south and may affect some radio communications and satellite operations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued a G4 geomagnetic storm watch, suggesting that much of the continental United States could witness the aurora. It is rare for auroras to reach such southern latitudes, making this a potentially historic event for skywatchers.While space weather determines when the aurora will occur, your viewing experience depends largely on preparation and local conditions. Experts recommend several strategies to increase your odds of seeing the lights clearly.If cloudy skies or poor visibility spoil your view tonight, there is still hope. The sequence of solar eruptions means geomagnetic activity could remain elevated for several days. Keep an eye on forecast updates through NOAA’s channels or dedicated aurora-tracking apps, as new opportunities may arise later this week.Even if you miss this particular show, solar activity is expected to stay strong for the remainder of the year, providing additional chances for aurora sightings across mid-latitudes.","The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, are expected to dazzle skywatchers across the United States tonight.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





MUNICH: OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT violated German copyright laws by reproducing lyrics from songs by best-selling musician Herbert Groenemeyer and others, a court ruled on Tuesday, in a closely watched case against the firm over its use of lyrics to train its language models. The regional court found that the company trained its AI on protected content from nine German songs, including Groenemeyer’s hits “Maenner” and “Bochum”. The case was brought by German music rights society GEMA.Presiding judge Elke Schwager ordered OpenAI to pay damages for the use of copyrighted material, without disclosing a figure.OpenAI had argued that its language models did not store or copy specific training data but, rather, reflected what they had learned based on the entire training data set.Since the output would only be generated as a result of user inputs known as prompts, it was not the defendants, but the users who would be liable, OpenAI had argued. However, the court found that both the memorisation in the language models and the reproduction of the song lyrics in the chatbot’s outputs constitute infringements of copyright exploitation right.“We disagree with the ruling and are considering next steps,” a spokesperson for OpenAI said. “The decision is for a limited set of lyrics and does not impact the millions of people who use our technology every day.”REUTERS",German court rules OpenAI violated copyright laws by reproducing lyrics from songs by best-selling musician Herbert Groenemeyer and others.

Putin's Men Crush Resistance In Kupyansk! Oil Depot & Rail Hubs Fall, 5,000 Ukrainian Forces Trapped

DW Fact check: False

Who is Kussia88?





""I've been mobilized, I'm heading to Chasiv Yar,"" says what appears to be a young Ukrainian soldier through floods of tears in the back of a military vehicle. ""Help me, I don't want to die. I'm only 23. Please help me.""A reverse image search using screenshots reveals that the video has been posted hundreds of times on social media, racking up millions of views and pushing the message that Ukraine is drafting young men against their will to replace losses on the battlefield amid the continuing Russian invasion.DW found the video shared across various social media platforms in a dozen different languages, including English, German, French, Italian, Spanishand Russian.The most viral instance of the video appeared on a Hungarian X account, where it had been viewed at least 1.8 million times.Claim: ""Ukrainian men as young as 23 are being conscripted and sent to the front""However, not only is the video factually incorrect (the minimum conscription age in Ukraine was lowered from 27 to 25 in April 2024, but never to 23), but it is also fake, to be precise: it was generated by artificial intelligence.This is clear from visual inaccuracies in the video, such as the poorly-fitting helmet, which doesn't match standard Ukrainian military equipment.Not only that, a basic facial recognition searchreveals that the face is actually that of Vladimir Yuryevich Ivanov, a young Russian streamer from St. Petersburg who uses the online pseudonym Kussia88.On its own, ""kussia"" (pronounced ""kasha"") means ""porridge"" in Russian (каша). But the use of ""88"" (neo-Nazi code for ""Heil Hitler"") and the Latin transcription using a double ""SS"" are no coincidence.Nor is the use of the letters ""IA"". In international neo-Nazi circles, ""IA"" would be understood to mean ""14"" — a code referring to the ""14 words""propagated by American neo-Nazi David Lane: ""We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.""The slogans have served as a rallying cry for militant white nationalists internationally.Indeed, the numbers 1488 and 8814 appear in the URL and profile description of Ivanov's accounts on TikTok and Boosty(a Russian platform that enables content creators to earn regular income through subscriptions and donations from their community).According to several Reddit chats, Ivanov's Twitch account, which has over 1.3 million followers, has been subject to at least one temporary ban in recent months.The AI video using Ivanov's face seems to have first appeared on the now-deleted TikTok channel @fantomoko, along with dozens of other similar AI clips, all supposedly depicting Ukrainian soldiers crying in military vehicles.Most only seem to have been viewed a few thousand times, but two had over 800,000 views, one had over 1.5 million views and the most popular had over 2.1 million. Some of the videos even featured the watermark ""Sora,"" OpenAI's image generator.Another face that appears regularly on clips posted by the @fantomoko account was that of Aleksei Gubanov, a critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Gubanov, who now lives in New York, told DW that he has ""absolutely no connection"" to the clips. ""All of them were created by someone using AI and without my consent or involvement.""He added he had warned his audience ""that someone is deliberately trying to stir public outrage by creating this kind of content. Those videos play directly into Russian propaganda narratives and gain millions of views. To be absolutely clear — I did not create, approve, or participate in any of those videos, and I strongly condemn the use of AI-generated fake media for manipulation or propaganda.""DW also reached out to Ivanov but had not received a response by the time of publication. According to the Ukrainian database ""Stars about war,"" which documents celebrities' positions on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Ivanov does not typically comment on the war and was once reprimanded by the Russian authorities for mocking the children of mobilized soldiers. After that, he reportedly apologized in a video shot against the background of a Russian flag, and stated that Crimea is Russian.Screenshot of Russian streamer Ivanov (aka Kussia88) posting a comment in Russian that translates as: ""The Twitter crowd have finally got on board the hype train.""Screenshot of Russian streamer Ivanov (aka Kussia88) posting a comment in Russian that translates as: ""The Twitter crowd have finally got on board the hype train.""'The Twitter crowd have finally got on board the hype train,' responds Kussia, sarcastically.Image: TelegramOn his Telegram channel, he responded to suggestions that he was involved with the AI videos and that he is a ""pro-Putin Nazi"" sarcastically, saying: ""The Twitter crowd have finally learned what 'delivery' means"" — Russian Twitch slang effectively meaning: ""They've finally got on board the hype train.""Either way, regardless of whether Ivanov was actively involved in their creation or not, and regardless of his views, the videos going viral remain entirely fake.","The video has been posted hundreds of times on social media, racking up millions of views.

Google hits $3 trillion: How Alphabet became the fastest to reach the milestone





JOHANNESBURG: Google will pay more than $40 million to support South African news media, many of them floundering in a digital age, the country's competition authority said Thursday.Tech giants, including TikTok, X and Facebook , have come under fire for anti-trust practices that the watchdog says hurt local media by limiting their ability to distribute and profit from their digital content.In February, the Competition Commission had recommended that Google pay up to $27 million a year for five years, following a 16-month investigation that found Google searches favoured international news over local outlets.But the California-based company ultimately agreed to a 688 million-rand ($40.4-million) funding package, the commission said Thursday as it released its final report.Under the agreement, $4 million will go to national publishers and broadcasters over five years for content on Google News , while $2.6 million will be allocated annually to support AI innovation.Community and small media outlets will receive $2.2 million over three years to support digital transformation.""Google will also introduce new user tools to prioritise local news sources, provide technical assistance to improve website performance, share enhanced audience data,"" the commission said, adding that YouTube had also agreed to support monetisation.The platforms also committed to removing algorithmic bias favouring foreign outlets, it said.Similar funding deals have been reached in countries including Taiwan, Canada, Australia and the United States in the face of mounting pressure from governments to introduce regulations requiring such arrangements.Chinese social media platform TikTok had meanwhile agreed to provide new tools, including allowing media to insert links within videos to monetise off-platform content.Social media platform X, owned by South African-born billionaire Elon Musk , did not reach a settlement and has been ordered to make all monetisation programmes available to local publishers and to provide training workshops.The directive can be appealed, the commission said.","Google will pay more than $40 million to support South African news media.

Why the UAE deliberately sank 3 ships: Is it good for the ocean’s ecosystem?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/why-the-uae-deliberately-sank-3-ships-is-it-good-for-the-oceans-ecosystem/articleshow/125237316.cms,"Inchcape 1, sunk off Al Aqah in 2001, has transformed into a thriving marine habitat, attracting divers with its diverse marine life/ Image: vipdivingdubai





The Concept: Artificial reefs for marine life





Inchcape 1: A Diver’s haven in Al Aqah





Inchcape 2: A thriving Reef off Khor Fakkan





Inchcape 10: A marine wonderland in Fujairah





The Impact: Ecological balance and marine conservation

Khaleej Times





Why the UAE deliberately sank 3 ships: Is it bad for the ocIn a unique blend of environmental stewardship and ecotourism, the UAE has deliberately sunk three ships off its east coast, not as an accident, but as a conscious effort to promote marine conservation. The vessels, Inchcape 1, Inchcape 2, and Inchcape 10, have been transformed into thriving artificial reefs that now attract divers from across the world. This innovative approach is a testament to the UAE’s commitment to protecting its natural resources while fostering sustainable tourism.The concept behind sinking these ships is simple yet effective: to create artificial reefs that mimic the role of natural coral reefs in the ocean. Over time, the ships have become vibrant ecosystems, teeming with marine life. These reefs not only support a wide range of fish species but also help to promote biodiversity, offering an underwater experience for divers.The UAE’s efforts are especially significant given the rising threats to ocean ecosystems, including pollution and coral bleaching. The ships, once decommissioned, serve as a reminder that responsible management can help restore marine habitats.Sunk in 2001, Inchcape 1 lies about 32 meters below the surface, off the coast of Al Aqah, Fujairah. Accessible by boat in just five minutes from Al Aqah, this site is recommended for experienced divers, thanks to its depth and complexity. The wreck has turned into a bustling underwater city, home to large schools of red snapper, cardinal fish, and a wide variety of other marine creatures.Divers exploring the site can witness firsthand how the wreck has evolved into a rich marine habitat. Snorkelling and diving equipment are essential to access the site, and the area is becoming a popular spot for eco-tourists looking to experience the UAE’s commitment to sustainable diving.Inchcape 2, intentionally sunk in 2002, rests at a depth of around 22 meters off the coast of Khor Fakkan. It has quickly become one of the most popular dive sites in the region. As the wreck has developed into a thriving coral reef, it now attracts a variety of marine life, including parrotfish, moray eels, small boxfish, and long-tailed rays. The presence of barracudas also adds to the site's allure, making it a must-visit destination for professional divers seeking to explore a healthy and diverse underwater ecosystem.To visit, divers typically embark on a 25-minute boat ride from Al Aqah. Diving equipment is mandatory, and access is managed through licensed diving centers. These centers not only ensure safety but also educate visitors on how artificial reefs contribute to ocean health.Perhaps the most remarkable of the three, Inchcape 10 (formerly known as 'Awaiz') was sunk in 2003. Resting at a depth of about 23 meters off Fujairah, it is one of the largest ships deliberately sunk to create an artificial reef. This site has become a focal point for divers due to its rich biodiversity, including moray eels, barracudas, and other species.Located just an 8-minute boat ride from the Fujairah International Marine Club, the wreck offers an exciting opportunity to explore the wonders of marine life. The site is open year-round, and divers must book through licensed diving centers to gain access. Similar to the other wrecks, the presence of thriving marine life at Inchcape 10 speaks volumes about the success of the UAE’s ecotourism initiatives.Saleh Al-Dhahouri, a diver from Dibba Al Fujairah, has seen firsthand the positive transformation that these shipwrecks have brought to the area. “The diving there is wonderful, a beautiful place, and you couldn't get over the amount of fish and coral,” he said, as told to. He explained that before the ships were sunk, diving opportunities were limited. “With these ships, diving sites have increased, and they have become part of the weekly diving program,” he added, highlighting how these artificial reefs have revitalized local dive tourism.Emirati diver Mintaha Al Shehhi, who specializes in sharks, has been diving in the region for over three years. She praised the ecological balance at sites like Inchcape 2, where frequent sightings of sharks and turtles indicate a healthy environment. “Sharks do not choose random locations, and turtles only pass through when they feel secure and find natural abundance,” she said, emphasizing that the presence of these larger creatures is a sign of a thriving and balanced marine ecosystem.ean’s ecosystem?","The UAE has deliberately sunk three ships off its east coast, not as an accident, but as a conscious effort to promote marine conservation.

Meet the creator - Chef Nouel Catis

The new Abu Dhabi Chocolate

The Main Flavor: A harmonious blend of rich salted caramel and traditional halwa (a dense, sweet delicacy).

Emirati Spices: The filling is layered with complex flavors like cardamom and fragrant saffron, giving it instant warmth and depth.

Local Touches: It features authentic ingredients like creamy tahini and sweet date syrup. The chef even notes hints of Balaleet, the sweet and savory Emirati breakfast dish.

Final Touch: To ensure its capital-city status, the bar is lavishly topped with shimmering 24-karat gold flakes.

Where to get the Golden Bar

Exclusive Initial Location: The Abu Dhabi Chocolate bar is initially sold exclusively at Rain Cafe outlets across the UAE.

Wider Delivery: For the brand's other popular flavors (like the Dubai Chocolate), you can often find them available for order on local food delivery platforms like Careem and Talabat in both Dubai and Abu Dhabi.

Price check

Price Range: The Abu Dhabi Chocolate bar is priced at approximately Dh100 (roughly $27 USD) for a 200g bar.

Other Sna'ap Bars: For comparison, the original 90g Dubai Chocolate bars typically sell for around Dh38.

Getting the viral treat outside the UAE

Rely on Travelers: The most common way to get the bars abroad is through friends, family, or colleagues who are traveling from the UAE and can carry them back as a unique souvenir.

Third-Party Shipping Services: Some international fans resort to using re-shipping or concierge services based in the UAE. These services purchase the bar locally and then ship it internationally, though this adds significant cost and is not handled by the chocolate maker itself.

Check Pop-ups: Keep an eye on the official Sna'ap/Chef Nouel Catis social media channels. As the brand grows, they may announce international pop-up events or partnerships that temporarily make the bars available in other countries.

Dubai’s famous Pistachio Crunch

Pistachio-Tahini Cream: A smooth, creamy paste with a deep, nutty Middle Eastern flavor.

Crispy Kataifi: Finely shredded, toasted filo dough, which gives the bar an irresistible, signature crunch (inspired by the famous dessert Knafeh).

The bar is a collaborative effort with a popular local cafe brand.The unique artisanal quality, the luxurious ingredients (like 24K gold), and its status as a viral, limited-edition treat put this bar in the premium category.For fans who want a genuine taste of luxury blended with authentic Emirati flavors, many consider the unique experience a worthwhile indulgence.If you’re a traveling foodie or a UAE resident currently abroad, getting these viral bars requires a bit of planning, as direct international shipping from the cafe is usually not available.If you're active on social media, you've definitely seen the satisfying snap of the viral Dubai Chocolate. Created by Chef Nouel Catis of the Sna'ap brand, this chocolate bar became a global hit because it’s much more than just a sweet treat, it’s a textural masterpiece.The secret to the original bar's obsession-worthy status lies in its core ingredients:This perfect contrast between the rich, creamy filling and the crispy pastry is why foodies worldwide have been trying to recreate this famous UAE-born chocolate.So, whether you're clicking ""add to cart"" via a delivery app in Dubai or hoping a traveling friend brings you a gold-flaked souvenir, one thing is clear: Chef Nouel Catis has successfully merged Middle Eastern heritage with modern indulgence.

Banality of evil: German nurse kills 10 patients,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/banality-of-evil-german-nurse-kills-10-patients-to-reduce-workload/articleshow/125132828.cms,"



It sounds like a line from a Kafka play rewritten by Kafka’s nurse. A man whose job was to ease suffering decided the easiest way to do that was to remove the sufferer entirely.According to a BBC report, a palliative care nurse in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering 10 patients and attempting to kill 27 others. His motive? Not money. Not mercy. Just the mundane — to lighten his workload during overnight shifts.Between December 2023 and May 2024, this nameless nurse — anonymous by law, infamous by act — played God with a syringe. Prosecutors said he injected elderly patients with morphine and midazolam, not to relieve their pain but to make his rounds quieter, his night easier, his burden lighter. He showed, the court heard, “irritation” at those who demanded too much care — as if suffering were an inconvenience on the shift roster.The court in Aachen called it a crime of “particular severity of guilt,” ensuring he will never walk free again. But what’s truly chilling is not just the scale of his actions — it’s their ordinariness. A man trained since 2007 to heal became, by 2024, an executioner in scrubs, armed not with malice but with indifference.Investigators are now exhuming more bodies, probing whether this was just the visible tip of a career-long pattern.If confirmed, he could rival the grim legacy of Niels Högel — the German nurse sentenced in 2019 for killing 85 patients in northern hospitals between 1999 and 2005. Högel wanted to play hero: inject, cause cardiac arrest, then resuscitate — a perverse performance of saviourhood.This new killer? He wanted peace and quiet.That’s the most terrifying part. Evil, it turns out, doesn’t always come snarling. Sometimes it sighs, glances at the clock, and reaches for the morphine. It isn’t ideological or even sadistic — just tired, overworked, and catastrophically devoid of empathy.In that sense, this case isn’t only about a man who murdered ten people. It’s about the slow erosion of compassion in systems that reduce care to shift patterns and metrics. When life becomes data, death becomes a shortcut.Germany has seen this before. It will see it again. Because as Hannah Arendt might have said of this nurse, it wasn’t the devil in him that killed those patients — it was the paperwork.","A palliative care nurse in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering 10 patients and attempting to kill 27 others.

A rare sight









A striking celestial display is poised to light up the night skies for millions across the United States as a potent solar storm makes its approach, beginning Tuesday, 11 November. Scientists predict that the aurora borealis, commonly known as the northern lights, will be visible in at least 21 states, with the spectacle lasting into the early hours of Wednesday, 12 November.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecasts that the lights will be most readily observed between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. Central Time, providing a window of nearly twelve hours for skywatchers. This rare event offers a vivid reminder of the delicate interplay between Earth and its parent star, as charged solar particles collide with the planet’s magnetic field to produce the swirling colours that have fascinated observers for centuries.According to NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center, residents in the following states may catch a glimpse of the aurora:Observers in these regions are encouraged to seek locations with minimal light pollution. Clear, dark skies will maximise the visibility of the aurora, which can appear as faint, undulating curtains of green, red, and purple, depending on atmospheric conditions and the intensity of the solar storm.The northern lights are the visible manifestation of interactions between the solar wind and Earth’s magnetosphere. Plasma from the Sun streams toward Earth, where charged particles are guided along magnetic field lines toward the polar regions. When these particles collide with gases in the atmosphere, they emit light, producing the spectacular displays that have been recorded and celebrated across cultures for millennia.In recent years, NOAA and the National Weather Service have provided increasingly precise forecasts of auroral activity, allowing skywatchers to plan for these fleeting events. The upcoming display is notable not only for its expected breadth, spanning nearly two dozen states, but also for the opportunity it affords the public to witness first-hand the dynamic forces at work in near-Earth space.For many, the northern lights remain a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Even in northern states, the display can be elusive, depending on cloud cover and the intensity of geomagnetic activity. This event underscores both the power of the Sun and the responsiveness of Earth’s magnetic shield, offering a vivid, natural spectacle that marries science with wonder.Skywatchers are advised to dress warmly and allow their eyes to adjust to darkness, enhancing the chances of spotting the aurora. With the lights expected to persist into Wednesday morning, residents from Alaska to Wisconsin have a rare opportunity to witness a natural phenomenon that, for centuries, has inspired awe and scientific curiosity alike.","Northern Lights will be visible across 21 US states from 11–12 November during dark, clear skies.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.





When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets. The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification







Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries. The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric- enabled version of the traditional paper certificate. It uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125101750,imgsize-47068,width-400,resizemode-4/life-certificate-2025-step-by-step-guide-to-generate-and-submit-jeevan-pramaan-online-and-offline.jpg"

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

What may be behind Tesla's 'change of heart'





Tesla is reportedly planning to do what the company has never done. In fact, not only something that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has stayed away from, but also what he has resisted for many-many years. According to a report by Bloomberg, Tesla is developing support for Apple's CarPlay system in its vehicles, working to add one of the most highly requested features by customers. The move is seen as a sharp reversal for a company that long resisted one of the auto industry’s most popular infotainment features.The electric-vehicle maker has begun internal testing of CarPlay, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the project remains confidential.Apple CarPlay, widely supported by other automakers, mirrors a simplified, vehicle-optimized version of the iPhone’s interface and is considered essential by many car buyers. Other major automakers, including Ford, General Motors and Hyundai, already offer Apple CarPlay across most of their lineups.If adopted, the move would mark a notable shift for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, who has for years rejected customer calls to integrate CarPlay.Musk has frequently criticized Apple’s practices — especially its App Store rules — and was incensed when the tech giant hired away Tesla engineers during its now-abandoned electric-car effort.Tesla has discussed launching CarPlay support in the coming months, though timelines remain fluid and the feature could be delayed or shelved, the people told Bloomberg. The automaker has a history of pausing or canceling features even after lengthy development cycles.The company currently relies on its proprietary infotainment platform, which includes Tesla-specific messaging tools, a browser and other in-house apps. Tesla’s resistance to allowing Apple greater access to vehicle systems was partly rooted in concerns that Apple intended to compete directly in electric vehicles — an ambition that ended in 2024 with the cancellation of the Titan project.The shift comes as Tesla faces softening demand, with some prospective buyers citing the absence of CarPlay as a reason to avoid the brand. Roughly one-third of consumers say the lack of CarPlay or Google’s Android Auto would be a deal-breaker, according to a 2024 McKinsey & Co. survey.Tesla is testing CarPlay within a windowed environment that sits inside its existing interface, Bloomberg reported. That means the Tesla operating system will continue to dominate the screen, unlike in many vehicles where CarPlay can take over entirely.CarPlay will not integrate with Tesla-specific features such as the Full Self-Driving system. Drivers will need to rely on Tesla’s native navigation for those capabilities. CarPlay will be supported wirelessly, allowing drivers to sync their iPhones without plugging in a cable, as per the report.Tesla plans to use the standard version of CarPlay rather than the Ultra version appearing in some Aston Martin and other high-end models. The standard variant, revamped in iOS 26, adds widgets for weather, calendars and similar information.","Tesla is reportedly developing support for Apple's CarPlay system in its vehicles.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai celebrates new breakthrough in quantum algorithm; Elon Musk replies: ‘Looks like…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-celebrates-new-breakthrough-in-quantum-algorithm-elon-musk-replies-looks-like/articleshow/124754841.cms,"



What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

‘Rough news but…’: Netflix shuts down studio behind game that hit number 1 in 26 countries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/rough-news-but-netflix-shuts-down-studio-behind-game-that-hit-number-1-in-26-countries/articleshow/124805503.cms,"Netflix shift in gaming strategy







Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including Squid Game Unleased which hit #1 in 26 countries. You’ll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles – they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through. As for Bill, Scott and me – we’re going to take a little breather before tackling whatever is next. Love to hear from you if there’s anything interesting going on, workwise or otherwise.Another employee, David Luehmann, a director of game development at the studio, also posted on LinkedIn, saying, ""After 10+ great years working at Boss Fight, the last few as part of Netflix, the time has come for the studio to close down.""“I am very proud of all the people, work, and games we've released. I wish you could see what we had cooking! There are many talented people that have been impacted by this. If anyone is looking to grow, I'll have many recommendations for you!” he added.Netflix acquired Boss Fight Entertainment in 2022 as part of its effort to diversify revenue streams by building out its video game offerings, news agency Reuters reported.The studio was known for developing two games available on the platform: Netflix Stories and the highly successful Squid Game: Unleashed, which reportedly hit the number one spot in 26 countries.The streaming giant's move follows an earnings call earlier this week where Co-CEO Greg Peters specifically praised Squid Game: Unleashed as an example of the kind of narrative game the company wanted to create based on its original shows.However, the company, which named Alain Tascan as president of games last year, is implementing a new strategy that will focus on four specific categories: party, narrative, kids, and mainstream games, the report added. The studio’s closure signals a realignment of resources toward this updated focus.Despite the shutdown, Boss Fight's two games, Netflix Stories and Squid Game: Unleashed, will continue to be available on the Netflix platform.","Boss Fight Entertainment's co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week.

Microsoft Research unveils Project Gecko to build multilingual AI systems,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-research-unveils-project-gecko-to-build-multilingual-ai-systems/articleshow/125304265.cms,"Microsoft

AI Assistant for farmers in India and Africa







Microsoft Research has launched Project Gecko, a new global initiative aimed at bridging the language and cultural gaps that currently hinder generative AI systems from serving the majority of the world's population. The initiative focuses on creating cost-effective, adaptable AI that leverages local languages and cultural contexts.According to the company, Project Gecko addresses the problem that many global communities are underrepresented in the data used to train large AI models, causing these tools to struggle with local languages and fail to provide relevant expertise.One of Project Gecko's key initiatives is FarmerChat, an AI-powered assistant developed in collaboration with Digital Green. FarmerChat is designed to provide agricultural extension workers and smallholder farmers in India and East Africa with timely, localised guidance in their preferred languages.By combining speech, text, and video interactions, FarmerChat enables farmers to obtain actionable, context-specific recommendations. This specialised guidance is intended to improve agricultural productivity and resilience against climate and resource challenges.Microsoft says that Project Gecko brings together researchers from Microsoft Research centers in India, Africa, and the US, alongside partners like Digital Green, to develop foundational frameworks that support truly global AI.The team has developed new AI frameworks, including MMCTAgent and VeLLM, which are designed to enhance reasoning across text, voice, and video interactions. These innovations support crucial local languages such as Hindi, Swahili, and Kikuyu.Notably, Meta AI has also built a single AI model, claiming that it is the first to translate across 200 different languages with a quality that has been validated through extensive evaluations for each of them.","Microsoft Research has launched Project Gecko, a new global initiative aimed at bridging the language and cultural gaps that currently hinder generative AI systems from serving the majority of the world's population.

How OpenAI is the reason why Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is not ‘worried’ about Google’s AI capability,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-openai-is-the-reason-why-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-is-not-worried-about-googles-ai-capability/articleshow/125304045.cms,"OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Microsoft’s Maia chip delay



OpenAI's chip strategy







Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company’s partnership with OpenAI gives it access to all of OpenAI's intellectual property except consumer hardware, providing Microsoft with AI capabilities that reduce concerns about Google’s competition in the field. OpenAI, on its part, has also struck deals with Nvidia, AMD and Google for AI chips, data centers and AI model training.During a podcast, Nadella explained the scope of Microsoft's access to OpenAI's technology. When asked if Microsoft has access to OpenAI's IP, Nadella responded: “In our case, the good news here is OpenAI has a program in which we have access to.”When pressed about whether Microsoft has access to all of it, Nadella confirmed: “All of it.”“So the only IP you don't have is consumer hardware?” the interviewer asked, to which Nadella responded, “That's it”.“By the way, we gave them a bunch of IPs as well to bootstrap them, right? So, this is one of the reasons why they had a mass because we built all these supercomputers together, and they benefited from it. Rightfully so,” Nadella added.Microsoft has delayed mass production of its next-generation Maia AI chips until 2026, according to a previous report from The Information.The tech giant pushed mass production of the new AI chips, codenamed Braga, back by at least six months. Braga is expected to be renamed Maia 200 upon release.Microsoft had planned to deploy the Braga chip into data centers this year, but delays attributed to unanticipated design changes, staffing constraints and high turnover made this impossible.While Microsoft's Maia chips face delays, Google's Tensor Processing Units have become a preferred option for training AI models. The TPUs have established themselves as reliable hardware for AI development, giving Google an advantage in the AI infrastructure market.Google designed its TPUs specifically for machine learning workloads and has refined them through multiple generations. The chips are widely available through Google Cloud and have been used to train major AI models, making them a proven option for AI developers.In addition to influencing Microsoft's chip development efforts, OpenAI is building its own AI chips in partnership with Broadcom. The AI company has also struck deals with Nvidia, AMD and Google for AI chips, data centers and AI model training.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company’s partnership with OpenAI gives it access to all of OpenAI's intellectual property except consumer hardware.

"Spotify rolls out three new Premium plans in India, prices start at Rs 139",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/spotify-rolls-out-three-new-premium-plans-in-india-prices-jump-to-rs-299/articleshow/125303405.cms,"Spotify has introduced a tiered Premium subscription in India, with plans ranging from Rs 139 to Rs 299. The new structure offers Lite, Standard, and Platinum options, with the latter unlocking lossless audio and AI features. Existing subscribers retain their current plans, while new users in select markets will adopt the revamped pricing.

Spotify Premium Lite , Premium Standard, Premium Platinum: What you get with each subscription plan

New users only, for now





Spotify is splitting its Premium subscription in India into three separate tiers, introducing options that range from Rs 139 to Rs 299 per month. The revamp means subscribers now have more choices, but accessing all the features Spotify has on offer will cost more than it used to.The move effectively raises prices for subscribers who want the full experience. What used to cost Rs 139 as an individual Premium plan now requires paying Rs 199 for Standard, or splurging on the Rs 299 Platinum tier to unlock lossless audio and AI features.Premium Lite, the entry point at Rs 139, covers the basics: ad-free listening with 160kbps audio quality, but no offline downloads. It's essentially the old plan stripped down to its essentials.Premium Standard at Rs 199 brings back offline support and bumps audio quality to 320kbps—the features most users expect from a paid music service. There's also a Student plan at Rs 99 with the same perks.The real talking point is Premium Platinum. At Rs 299, it's more than double the old individual plan price. But you get lossless audio streaming for the first time in India, plus Spotify's AI DJ that introduces songs with commentary, AI-powered playlist creation, and integration with DJ software like rekordbox and Serato.The plan also lets two additional household members create separate accounts.Spotify says existing subscribers keep their current plans and pricing, though they can upgrade if they want. The new structure only applies to fresh sign-ups in India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and the UAE—markets where Spotify sees room to grow.The company's betting that listeners fall into distinct camps: casual streamers who just want music without ads, everyday users who need offline access, and audiophiles willing to pay premium rates for lossless quality and advanced features.","Spotify has introduced a tiered Premium subscription in India, with plans ranging from Rs 139 to Rs 299.
