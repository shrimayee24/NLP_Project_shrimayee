Tesla fire claims lives of four Indians in Canada after electronic door malfunctions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/tesla-fire-claims-lives-of-four-indians-in-canada-after-electronic-door-malfunctions/articleshow/115226891.cms,"Four friends of Indian descent in Canada lost their lives in a burning Tesla after a crash that reportedly rendered the car's electronic door handles inoperable, according to the Daily Mail. The sole survivor, a woman in her 20s, was rescued from the crash on October 24 when Canada Post employee Rick Harper broke the window of the burning Tesla Model Y with a metal pole.The victims were identified as 25-year-old Neelraj Gohil, his sister Ketaba Gohil, 29, along with Jay Sisodiya and Digvijay Patel.Tesla vehicles lack traditional handles; instead, they use electronic buttons to open the doors. However, after a crash, power failures can cause these doors to jam. ""I would assume the young lady would have tried to open the door from the inside, because she was pretty desperate to get out,"" Harper was quoted as saying.'I don't know if that was the battery or what. But she couldn't get out.'Harper recounted that the woman escaped the car head-first after he broke the window. The smoke was so dense that he couldn’t see there were others still trapped inside, leaving him uncertain whether they, too, had been desperately trying to get out.Police said that the car was traveling at high speed when it struck a guardrail along Toronto's Lake Shore Boulevard East. The exact cause of the crash remains unkown yet.While Tesla promotes a ""safety-first design,"" experts point out that its manual door-release system is not widely known. This feature requires occupants to pull away a panel and tug a cable beneath it, but accident victims may be too panicked or disoriented to locate this in an emergency.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is conducting nine investigations into Tesla Model Y vehicles—the model involved in this incident—over issues such as ""unexpected brake activation"" and ""sudden unintended acceleration.""","The victims were identified as Neelraj Gohil, his sister Ketaba, 29, Jay Sisodiya and Digvijay Patel.

Why Fans Are So Invested in Klay’s Love Life

When it comes to Klay Thompson , fans are just as intrigued by his life off the court as they are by his skills on it. The four-time NBA champion and former Golden State Warriors star is a free agent in 2024, drawing interest from teams across the league. But while his basketball future is up in the air, fans are curious about another aspect of his life: his relationship status.Let’s break down what we know about Klay’s love life this year and take a look back at his dating history.Also read - All you need to know about Jamal Murray's girlfriend, Harper Hempel: Her career, controversy and more As of now, Klay Thompson is single.The 34-year-old guard has always been private about his personal life, leaving much of his romantic history to speculation. The last time his dating life made headlines was in 2022 when rumors swirled about a connection with an Instagram model. However, nothing was ever confirmed.It’s possible Klay is keeping a relationship under wraps—or he might just be focused on himself and his career right now. Either way, there’s no public girlfriend in the picture for 2024.Klay’s dating history has been a mix of high-profile romances and rumored flings, many of which became public through social media or tabloid speculation.Klay’s first notable relationship was with comedian and influencer Hannah Stocking. The pair seemed solid until things ended in drama when Stocking accused Klay of cheating. She even called him out on social media, making their split very public.Shortly after his breakup with Stocking, Klay reportedly started dating stylist Carleen Henry. While their relationship wasn’t heavily publicized, it ended on a rocky note when private messages between the two were leaked, prompting their split.One of Klay’s most high-profile relationships was with actress Laura Harrier. They were frequently spotted together at events, and their romance often made its way to Instagram. The two eventually split in 2020, with rumors suggesting it might have involved another actress, Eiza González. Neither Klay nor Laura confirmed these claims.Over the years, Klay has been linked to several women, including Tiffany Suarez (2015), Cherise Sandra (2016), Abigail Ratchford (2017), and Kristen Evangeline (2022). However, most of these rumors were never substantiated.Klay’s blend of talent, charisma, and a relatively low profile off the court makes him an intriguing figure for fans. Whether he’s posting pictures of his dog Rocco or keeping fans guessing about his personal life, Klay has mastered the art of balancing fame and privacy.For now, it looks like basketball—and possibly signing with a new team—remains his main focus.Also read - NBA Star Dwight Howard on Dancing With the Stars: “Best Decision I Made,” Says It’s Helped His Game",Klay Thompson is a four-time NBA champion and former Golden State Warriors star.

For the first time since the devastating fire of 2019, the eight bells of Notre Dame Cathedral rang in unison on Friday. The bells, housed in the northern belfry, were silenced after the fire ravaged the iconic landmark.Five years of extensive efforts have brought the cathedral closer to its former glory. The fire's damage to the northern belfry necessitated comprehensive restoration, including removal, cleaning and reinstallation of the bells.The bells chimed individually before harmonising for roughly five minutes, marking as milestone moment ahead of the cathedral's reopening, scheduled for next month. Philippe Jost, who oversees the restoration project, said, ""This is a beautiful, important and symbolic step.""The bells rang individually before joining in harmony for approximately five minutes. This test run precedes the official reopening ceremonies planned for December 7 and 8.Alexandre Gougeon, responsible for the bells' reinstallation, acknowledged: ""It's not perfect yet, but we will make it perfect."" He confirmed to AFP that the initial test was successful.Guillaume Normand, the cathedral's vice rector, expressed profound emotion upon hearing the bells' chorus, noting: ""It's November 8 and Notre Dame is telling us: 'I'm here, waiting for you'.""The bells vary significantly in weight, from ""Gabriel"" at over four tonnes to ""Jean-Marie"" at 800 kilogrammes.The cathedral's reopening celebrations are scheduled for December 7 and 8. Whilst specific programme details remain unpublished, Jost informed RTL that performances would feature ""great artists of international standing.""Reports suggest Paul McCartney, who has Paris concerts scheduled for December 4 and 5, might participate in the reopening festivities.Post-reopening, Notre Dame anticipates 14 to 15 million annual visitors, an increase from 12 million in 2017.The catastrophic fire in April 2019, shocked both Parisians and global onlookers as the UNESCO heritage site was engulfed in flames, resulting in the collapse of its iconic spire.President Emmanuel Macron had established a five-year timeline for reconstruction, aiming to restore the cathedral to surpass its former glory.","The eight bells of Notre Dame Cathedral rang in unison for the first time since the devastating fire of 2019.

When did it originate

The ""That feeling when knee surgery is tomorrow"" meme, also known as the Blue Grinch meme , expresses a specific emotional state associated with a pending knee surgery.The knee surgery meme , which gained widespread popularity, traces its origins to an earlier version featuring a squirrel image.The meme finds humor in a highly specific and relatable situation, creating an instant connection for those who have experienced the anxiety of an upcoming medical procedure, specifically knee surgery.The inclusion of the ""Blue Grinch"" character amplifies the sense of nervousness and lack of energy surrounding the experience.The humor lies in its highly specific focus, serving as both a commentary on traditional meme conventions and a departure from them, the Daily Dot reported.The meme focuses on such specific and nuanced situations that its precision itself becomes the punchline, providing a clever commentary on meme culture that is both humorous and insightful.While most memes strive for widespread appeal by tapping into universal emotions, the ""knee surgery"" meme maintains a deliberately narrow scope, which sets it apart.According to Know Your Meme, the first version of this meme was created in 2021 by an anonymous user on MemeCreator.org. It featured an animated squirrel standing upright with its front paws raised, capturing widespread attention when it appeared on the Instagram account stupid.fricken.meme later that year.At present, the ""Blue Grinch knee surgery"" memes remain notably non-political in nature.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What Meta spokesperson said

Meta , the parent company of Facebook , to stand trial for its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, a federal judge has ordered. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) alleges that these purchases were anti-competitive moves aimed at suppressing potential rivals in the social media industry. The FTC 's lawsuit seeks to dismantle the tech giant.Judge James Boasberg rejected Meta's request to dismiss the case filed in 2020 – under the Trump administration. The FTC argues that Meta, then known as Facebook, overpaid for Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 to eliminate potential threats instead of competing fairly.While Judge Boasberg allowed the core claim regarding the acquisitions to proceed, he dismissed a separate allegation that Facebook unfairly restricted third-party app developers' access to its platform. He also ruled that Meta cannot argue that the WhatsApp acquisition strengthened its position against Apple and Google as a defence.The FTC views the case as a bipartisan effort to curb Meta's alleged monopoly power and promote innovation in the social media landscape.“This case represents a bipartisan effort to curtail Meta's monopoly power and restore competition to ensure freedom and innovation in the social media ecosystem,” said FTC spokesperson Douglas Farrar.Meta maintains that the acquisitions benefited competition and consumers.""We are confident that the evidence at trial will show that the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp have been good for competition and consumers,"" a Meta spokesperson said.Meta had previously urged the judge to dismiss the entire case, saying it depended on an overly narrow view of social media markets, and did not take into account competition from ByteDance's TikTok, Google's YouTube, X and Microsoft's LinkedIn.As per news agency Reuters, the case against Meta is one of five blockbuster lawsuits where antitrust regulators at the FTC and US Department of Justice are going after Big Tech.","The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) alleges that these purchases were anti- competitive moves aimed at suppressing potential rivals.

How scammers are using digital wedding invites on WhatsApp to target users



HP Police's warning against these scams



“If you receive an unsolicited wedding invitation or any file from an unknown number, do not click on it. Ensure you verify the sender and the file before downloading anything onto your phone.""

Scammers are reportedly exploiting the rising trend of digital wedding invitations on WhatsApp. Himachal Pradesh Police officials have warned that scammers are using these digital wedding invitations that are shared on WhatsApp to spread malware and compromise personal data. Scammers are reportedly sending malicious APK files disguised as wedding invitations via WhatsApp.Downloading these files can infect phones with malware and grant hackers full access to the device. This allows them to send messages, steal personal information, and even extort money from the victim's phone without their knowledge. As the wedding season peaks and digital invitations become more common, users are urged to exercise caution and avoid downloading suspicious files , even if they appear to be from trusted contacts.According to a report by News18, this new WhatsApp scam scam uses fake wedding invitations to trick users into downloading malware. The scam involves receiving a message from an unknown number with an attached APK file disguised as a wedding invitation.Once downloaded, the malicious file installs an app that grants cybercriminals access to the victim's data, allowing them to monitor activities and even hijack the phone's functions. In some cases, scammers use the compromised device to impersonate the victim and send messages to their contacts requesting money or sensitive information. This can result in significant financial losses and reputational damage.Following a rise in cybercrime related to malicious files spread via WhatsApp, the Himachal Pradesh Cyber Police are urging citizens to be wary of messages from unknown numbers, particularly those containing attachments, the report adds. They have advised users against downloading any files from unfamiliar sources, especially APK files, which are often used to install malware.In a statement to News18, DIG Mohit Chawla, Himachal Pradesh State CID and Cyber Crime Department said:While downloading files from trusted contacts is generally considered safe, the Himachal Pradesh Cyber Police also emphasised the importance of verifying the legitimacy of any file received, especially if it seems unusual or unexpected.","Scammers are sending malicious APK files disguised as wedding invitations.

Microsoft confirmed this behaviour to The Verge, describing it as ""a notification giving people the choice to import data from other browsers.""The popup features a prominent blue ""confirm and continue"" button, while the option to decline is limited to a small ""X"" button that blends with the background design. If users accept, Edge will continuously import their Chrome tabs, history, and bookmarks, even when Chrome remains the default browser.This aggressive tactic follows similar controversial moves by Microsoft earlier this year when Edge automatically imported Chrome tabs without user consent. After facing criticism, Microsoft quietly addressed that issue in an update, only to introduce this new method months later.The strategy is part of Microsoft's ongoing campaign to increase Edge adoption, The Verge notes. Previous tactics included blocking third-party tools that redirect Edge links to other browsers, making it difficult to change default browsers in Windows 11, and displaying warning messages when users attempt to download Chrome.Despite these efforts, Edge's market growth remains slow. The browser's forceful promotion has drawn criticism from consumer advocacy groups and other browser makers, who have called for increased regulatory oversight of Microsoft's practices.Users can disable the automatic startup behaviour, but doing so requires launching Edge and navigating through multiple settings, even if they've never used the browser before.","Microsoft is once again attempting to automatically import Google Chrome users' data into its Edge browser through a new popup.

Despite recent speculation about Apple's potential entry into the smart ring market , Tom Hale, CEO of health-tech firm Oura, believes the tech giant is likely to skip the launch of a competitor to its Apple Watch. Hale, whose company has been working on smart ring technology since 2013, believes Apple's focus remains on the Apple Watch as its primary health and fitness platform.“I think they [Apple] are unconvinced about the value of having a ring and a watch together and they’re not interested in undercutting the Apple Watch as a business,” Hale told CNBC in an interview on the sidelines of the Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal.Samsung has already launched a smart ring debut earlier this year, with one analyst from market research firm CCS Insight predicting that Apple may launch its own smart ring in 2026.“I think they’re probably keeping a close eye on Samsung and a close eye on us, but it’s hard to do this product category right, “ said Hale, who believes that Apple's focus remains firmly on the Apple Watch as its wearable platform.Under CEO Tim Cook, Apple has put a large focus on health applications through the Apple Watch that has become the holy grail of wearables.“Apple is very much a focused company. They’re like: ‘We’ve put our bet on the watch. We’re gonna make the watch our platform,’” Hale said.While smart rings offer several advantages over smartwatches, including their lightweight design, longer battery life, and greater comfort for all-day wear, especially during sleep, smartwatches have their own pros, such as large display for read notifications, ability to make calls, send texts, control music, and even run standalone apps.In fact, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman also said that if Apple launches a ring that offers the same health features as Apple Watch, it may jeopardise the wearable audience.","Tom Hale, CEO of health-tech firm Oura, believes Apple is likely to skip the launch of a competitor to its Apple Watch.

Researchers at New Mexico Tech ’s Institute of Mining and Technology, located in Socorro, New Mexico, have embarked on an innovative project to create drones and robots modelled after deceased birds . These ""animatronic"" bird drones, currently still in the testing phase, aim to improve wildlife monitoring by providing a less intrusive, more natural way of studying birds and other animals. The project has gained attention for its unique approach to wildlife observation, and it addresses some of the limitations associated with traditional drone technology.The main goal of these bird-inspired drones is to observe wildlife without disturbing their natural behaviour. Traditional drones often make a lot of noise, which can frighten animals and cause them to flee. For instance, when monitoring large animals like elephants in Africa, the noise from drones can be loud enough to startle the animals, leading to them scattering or becoming stressed. By creating drones that mimic the appearance and movement of birds, the researchers aim to overcome this issue and observe animals in a more natural and discreet way.Mostafa Hassanalian, the lead researcher and mechanical engineering professor at New Mexico Tech, explained that these bird-like drones could be an important tool for studying animal behaviour, such as bird formations, communication, and other ecological dynamics. The ability to blend in with real wildlife means that these drones would be less likely to disrupt the animals they are meant to observe, allowing for more accurate and less biassed data collection.The research team has developed several prototypes of ""zombie birds,"" which are essentially robotic birds made from the preserved bodies of deceased animals. These robots are designed to replicate the appearance and movement of real birds in order to blend in with live wildlife. Here are the three main types of bird-like robots created so far:One of the prototypes is a drone equipped with flapping wings, designed to imitate a real bird’s flight. The researchers used a taxidermied pheasant’s head and wings to create the flapping-wing drone. This bird-like drone is intended to blend in with real pheasants and mimic their natural behaviour in the wild. By using taxidermied birds, the team ensures the drone has a realistic look and movement pattern that can be difficult to distinguish from living birds in the environment.In addition to the flapping-wing drone, the researchers have also developed two versions of robotic mallard ducks: one that can fly and another that can swim.This drone is modelled after the pheasant prototype, with a similar design that includes flapping wings. It is intended for observing birds in flight and studying their patterns and behaviours from the air.Unlike the flying version, this robot is designed to replicate the natural swimming movements of a mallard duck. It features special robotic feet that glide smoothly through water, allowing the robot to move in a way that mimics a real duck. This version is particularly useful for studying aquatic life and observing ducks and other waterfowl in their natural habitat.The team’s latest creation involves a stationary pigeon designed to look like a real bird but with the added capability of carrying a camera in its neck. This pigeon robot can provide real-time video feeds or broadcast footage, making it a valuable tool for remote surveillance or wildlife observation. The camera-equipped pigeon can be placed in natural environments, allowing researchers to monitor animal activity without the need for human presence, which could potentially disturb the ecosystem.One important aspect of this research is that all the birds used in these projects were already deceased before being repurposed. Hassanalian emphasised that they are not using live animals for this purpose, ensuring that no harm is done to wildlife. Instead, they are recycling birds that have already passed away, which makes the research more ethical and sustainable. This approach also highlights the potential of reusing materials that would otherwise go to waste, giving a new life to the preserved bodies of animals.While the current focus of the research is on improving wildlife monitoring, there are potential future applications for this technology, including in the field of surveillance. The ability to create lifelike, nature-inspired robots could make them useful in various areas where traditional drones might be too conspicuous or disruptive. For example, in surveillance applications, these ""zombie birds"" could be deployed to observe public spaces or areas with wildlife in a manner that is less intrusive and more unobtrusive.In the future, these robotic birds could also play a role in studying endangered species or remote ecosystems, where human presence might be limited or harmful to the environment. The technology could further evolve to incorporate more advanced sensors, autonomous navigation, and AI capabilities, enabling even more sophisticated forms of ecological research and surveillance.","Researchers at New Mexico Tech are developing drones and robots modelled after deceased birds.

LG announces world's largest stretchable display: All details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/lg-announces-worlds-largest-stretchable-display-all-details/articleshow/115225209.cms,"What are stretchable displays



How this prototype is better than the previous one



LG’s largest-ever foldable display prototype is now official. The company announced the existence of the world's first stretchable display which is capable of expanding up to 50%. This is the highest rate of elongation in the foldable display industry. The Korean company demonstrated the panel during a meeting at LG Science Park in Seoul with more than 100 South Korean industry, academia, and research participants involved in a stretchable display national project.Stretchable displays are seen as the ultimate free-form foldable screen technology because they can be freely transformed into any shape. This includes stretching, folding and twisting. LG’s prototype features a 12-inch screen that stretches up to 18 inches, while simultaneously delivering a resolution of 100ppi (pixels per inch) and full red, green, and blue (RGB) colour.Earlier, in 2022, LG unveiled its first stretchable display prototype. However, the new panel's maximum elongation rate has more than doubled from 20% to 50%.The company said that it has improved the properties of a special silicon material substrate used in contact lenses and developed a new wiring design structure for the latest prototype. LG Display also claimed that this panel will offer more stretchability and flexibility, exceeding the original national project's target of 20% elongation.By using a micro-LED light source of up to 40μm (micrometres), the new prototype's strengthened durability means it can be repeatedly stretched over 10,000 times, maintaining clear image quality even in extreme environments such as exposure to low or high temperatures and external shocks, the company notes.The company also showcased numerous concepts where stretchable displays can be adopted, including an automotive panel that stretches out into a convex shape and can be operated by hand as well as a wearable display attached to firefighters' uniforms that provides real-time information.",LG Display has unveiled its largest-ever foldable display prototype.

YouTube’s latest update for Android may be buggy: What affected users claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/youtubes-latest-update-for-android-may-be-buggy-what-affected-users-claim/articleshow/115224332.cms,"What some users are saying about the bug

YouTube down for some users in India

YouTube app for Android recently got an update. Some users claim that the update has introduced frustrating bugs affecting playback and miniplayer functionality. The update, which rolled out on November 7, brought granular playback speed controls but also seems to have inadvertently introduced these glitches.As per a section of users, one bug is hampering the functionality of the miniplayer that disappears when positioned on the right side of the screen. They claim that the miniplayer exits the screen when dragged to the right edge, requiring them to tap the video thumbnail again to make it reappear, according to a report by Android Police.The second bug is said to be preventing video playback from resuming when the device is in portrait mode. Users have observed that after switching to full-screen landscape mode, pausing the video, and returning to portrait mode, playback cannot be resumed without returning to full-screen mode.While the exact cause of these bugs remains unclear, they appear to be linked to the latest update. For those affected by these bugs, rolling back to an older version of the YouTube app seems to provide a temporary solution.Meanwhile, YouTube users in India reportedly faced issues with the Google-owned video platform on the YouTube app as well as website. They claimed to be facing issues with the YouTube Play button. But the issue seems to have been resolved.According to DownDetector, approximately 56% of users experienced issues with video streaming, while 23% and 21% faced problems with server connection and the app, respectively. The issue with YouTube appears to be limited as most members of the Times of India Tech team did not report any problems with the YouTube app on Android and iOS or the website throughout the day.","YouTube app for Android recently got an update.
