Is Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez planning for 2028 US presidential bid? Netizens react,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-congresswoman-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-planning-for-2028-us-presidential-bid-netizens-react/articleshow/115820619.cms,"File photo: Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Picture credit: AP)

Speculation about Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) running for president in 2028 gained momentum after The Hill published a report naming her among potential Democratic candidates.The article highlighted her strong appeal to grassroots voters and her ability to connect with people in a way that sets her apart from many in Washington. A Democratic strategist quoted in the piece praised her authenticity, describing her as someone who “cuts through the noise and doesn’t talk like Washington.”However, another strategist expressed skepticism, arguing that her progressive approach and push for rapid change might alienate traditional Democrats. “She and the 'Squad' started pushing too hard, too fast. DC doesn’t work that way,” the strategist noted.The speculation ignited a storm of reactions online, particularly from conservatives. Former Congressman Matt Gaetz claimed that AOC has been eyeing a presidential bid since 2019.One critic on X remarked, “I didn’t think there could be a more stupid person than Kamala as the Democrat nominee... until now.”Another user joked, “Somewhere in America, JD Vance is enjoying breakfast and laughing at the thought of AOC running for president in 2028.”Republican Representative Tim Burchett weighed in, warning against dismissing her potential as a serious contender. “Quit underestimating our opponents. That’s how we got Carter, Clinton, Obama, and Biden,” he wrote.Despite the criticism, some social media users acknowledged her potential impact. A commentator noted that while AOC’s policies are divisive, her authenticity resonates with voters, making her a formidable candidate who could challenge expectations even if her chances of winning remain uncertain.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, commonly known as AOC, represents New York’s 14th Congressional District. She first gained prominence in 2018 by unseating a veteran incumbent in a primary upset, becoming one of the youngest women elected to Congress at age 29. Known for her progressive stances, AOC has championed initiatives like the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, and economic reforms aimed at reducing inequality.Her rapid rise to political fame has positioned her as a leading figure within the Democratic Party’s progressive wing and a polarizing figure across the political spectrum.While AOC has not publicly confirmed any plans for a 2028 run, the discussions sparked by this report reflect growing curiosity about her future in US politics.","Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, commonly known as AOC, represents New York’s 14th Congressional District.

Donald Trump: Watch: Embarrassed Barron Trump reacts to Trump and Musk groove to YMCA at Thanksgiving in Mar-a-Lago,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-embarrassed-barron-trump-reacts-to-trump-and-musk-groove-to-ymca-at-thanksgiving-in-mar-a-lago/articleshow/115810858.cms,"YMCA: The Soundtrack of Trump’s Campaigns



Barron Trump: The Quiet Campaign Strategist



Elon Musk: From Tech Visionary to Trump Confidant



A Thanksgiving Moment That Stole the Spotlight



The Thanksgiving gathering at Mar-a-Lago this year had all the elements of a viral spectacle: Donald Trump and Elon Musk dancing—if awkwardly—to YMCA , a soundtrack synonymous with Trump’s campaign rallies, while Barron Trump , the president-elect’s 18-year-old son, watched on, visibly embarrassed. Yet amidst the table-smacking, shoulder-tapping antics of Trump and Musk, Barron has quietly become an unsung hero of Trump’s campaign success, earning praise for his strategic contributions behind the scenes.As YMCA played, Trump belted out his signature “bam, bam, bam” while urging Musk, who was initially content with subtle head nods, to throw his arms into the air in time with the beat. Musk reluctantly obliged, eliciting a beaming grin from Trump. Meanwhile, Barron, seated between his mother, Melania, and Musk, offered a hesitant smile, his discomfort palpable. His body language spoke volumes, capturing the universal plight of teenagers mortified by their parents’ public antics.The Village People’s YMCA has become an unlikely yet enduring anthem of Trump’s political rallies, a high-energy song that brings nostalgic levity to his events. Though its disco roots and LGBTQ+ associations might seem at odds with Trump’s base, the song’s universal appeal and infectious beat have made it a campaign staple. For Trump, YMCA represents more than just a crowd-pleaser—it’s a unifying moment that embodies his ability to turn political events into dynamic, entertainment-filled experiences.At the Thanksgiving table, however, the song’s significance took a backseat to the camaraderie between Trump and Musk, who has become a fixture at Mar-a-Lago since Trump’s election win. Yet, while the president-elect relished the moment, his youngest son seemed less enthused, his reaction quickly going viral on social media. One user joked, “Barron’s thinking, ‘Okay, have we had enough of this song yet, Father?’” Another added, “The poor kid is stuck between his dad and Elon Musk—let him leave the table!”While Barron’s Thanksgiving discomfort may have stolen the internet’s attention, insiders know that the youngest Trump has been instrumental in crafting key elements of his father’s campaign. Barron has earned praise for spearheading the strategy behind Trump’s podcast outreach—a medium that played a pivotal role in swaying undecided male voters.Recognizing the growing influence of long-form audio content among young and middle-aged men, Barron reportedly helped design a podcasting strategy that positioned Trump as relatable and engaging to this critical demographic. With a focus on Trump’s storytelling and direct, unscripted style, the podcast series resonated with voters who appreciated an unfiltered perspective amidst a crowded media landscape. This effort helped Trump close the gap with undecided voters in battleground states, underscoring Barron’s keen understanding of emerging communication platforms.Elon Musk’s presence at Mar-a-Lago has evolved from occasional visits to near-constant companionship, earning him the moniker “First Buddy” in political circles. As Trump’s confidant and incoming head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk has seamlessly integrated into Trump’s world, joining phone calls with foreign leaders and even appearing at campaign events. His willingness to join in Trump’s YMCA antics—albeit reluctantly—underscored Musk’s growing comfort in this unconventional political environment.The Thanksgiving gathering at Mar-a-Lago was quintessential Trump: a blend of family warmth, political theater , and viral-ready moments. While Trump and Musk reveled in their impromptu dance, Barron’s expression of embarrassment and restraint became the internet’s focal point, cementing his reputation as the most relatable member of the Trump family.Yet beneath the surface of teenage awkwardness lies a budding political strategist. Barron’s contributions to his father’s campaign highlight his growing influence within the Trump orbit, proving that even as he avoids the spotlight, he is far from a passive observer.","The Thanksgiving gathering at Mar-a-Lago was quintessential Trump: a blend of family warmth, political theater, and viral-ready moments.

This time, however, the holiday gathering also included Elon Musk and his mother.Musk responded to a clip shared by a user on social media platform X, in which Trump could be seen interacting with his son Barron. In response, Musk said: ""I was discussing consciousness & video games with Barron,"" offering a glimpse into his conversation with the younger Trump.Maye Musk took to X to respond to her son's post. In a reply, she said, “They were talking all night. Barron is very smart,” praising Barron Trump's intellectual capabilities during their conversation.The Musk family’s presence added a special touch to the family gathering, which also featured a moment when Elon Musk was seen dancing to the classic ""YMCA"" song. The tune has become somewhat of a staple at Republican rallies, with Trump himself famously dancing to it at his final rally in Georgia before the election.Maye Musk also interacted with Lara Trump, wife of Donald Trump’s son Eric. Lara posted a picture of Donald Trump with her two children, Luke and Carolina, to which Maye Musk responded warmly, saying, “Your kids are adorable.”The Thanksgiving celebration at Mar-a-Lago was not limited to the Trump family and the Musk duo. Hollywood icons like Sylvester Stallone also made an appearance.Mar-a-Lago, a lavish estate dating back to the 1920s, has long been Trump’s go-to destination for Thanksgiving.

Aurora activity peaks during the

solar cycle

Skywatchers across the northern United States might be in for a treat tonight as the northern lights , or aurora borealis , could dazzle the skies on Black Friday .The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) has issued a G2 (moderate) geomagnetic storm watch for Friday, signalling the potential for vibrant auroral displays across several states.The geomagnetic storm could bring radiant displays of green, red, and purple hues to states including Washington, Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Maine. Northern areas of New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Idaho may also catch glimpses of the celestial show.The best time for viewing is in the hours just before and after midnight, and NOAA advises heading to locations away from city lights for a clearer view.Cloud cover may obstruct the view in parts of the Northeast and Great Lakes regions, but clear skies elsewhere offer promising conditions for skywatchers. For those capturing the auroras, smartphone cameras may reveal colours that are not easily visible to the naked eye.The northern lights have been more frequent this year as the sun approaches the peak of its 11-year solar cycle, known as the solar maximum . This heightened solar activity is expected to continue through 2025, increasing the likelihood of more auroral displays across the United States.","The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has issued a G2 (moderate) geomagnetic storm watch for Friday.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Neem Karoli Baba, an Indian mystic and spiritual leader, has left an indelible mark on some of the most influential figures in the global tech industry. Known for his simplicity, wisdom, and teachings focused on love and service, Neem Karoli Baba has inspired many, including tech icons like Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jack Dorsey. These individuals credit their encounters with his teachings or ashram as pivotal moments in their lives, shaping their personal philosophies and professional trajectories. This article explores the profound influence of Neem Karoli Baba on these leaders and how his spiritual legacy continues to resonate within the tech world.The late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs visited Neem Karoli Baba’s ashram in Kainchi, Uttarakhand, in the mid-1970s. Jobs embarked on the journey seeking spiritual enlightenment during a period of personal and professional uncertainty. Although Neem Karoli Baba had passed away in 1973, Jobs spent time at the ashram absorbing its serene atmosphere and interacting with the Baba’s disciples.The visit left a lasting impression on Jobs. He later described how the experience shaped his vision of simplicity and focus, traits that became hallmarks of Apple’s design philosophy. Jobs also shared the spiritual insights he gained with others, recommending the ashram to his friends, including Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg.In 2015, Mark Zuckerberg revealed that he visited Neem Karoli Baba’s ashram on Jobs’ suggestion. During Facebook’s early days, Zuckerberg faced challenges that made him question the company’s direction. Jobs advised him to visit the ashram for clarity and inspiration.Zuckerberg spent time at the ashram, where he experienced a sense of peace and purpose. The visit reinforced his belief in Facebook’s mission to connect the world. He later stated that this spiritual journey provided him with the confidence and determination to move forward during a critical phase in Facebook’s growth.Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey also draws inspiration from Neem Karoli Baba’s teachings, particularly in the context of mindfulness and meditation. Although Dorsey has not publicly detailed a direct visit to the ashram, he has spoken extensively about the influence of Indian spirituality on his life and work.Dorsey’s regular practice of meditation aligns with Neem Karoli Baba’s emphasis on inner peace and self-awareness. This mindfulness approach has shaped his leadership style, helping him navigate the pressures of running global tech companies like Twitter and Square.Neem Karoli Baba’s teachings emphasize love, service, and the power of selflessness. He believed in treating everyone equally and living a life dedicated to helping others. His simple yet profound wisdom has inspired individuals to adopt a more balanced and compassionate approach to life.Key lessons from Neem Karoli Baba include:These principles resonate deeply with individuals in high-stress industries like technology, where innovation and success often come at the cost of personal well-being.Neem Karoli Baba’s influence extends far beyond the tech industry. His ashram continues to attract visitors from around the world, including celebrities, entrepreneurs, and spiritual seekers. Books like Miracle of Love by Ram Dass, a disciple of Neem Karoli Baba, have further popularized his teachings internationally.The mystic’s philosophy appeals to tech leaders because it offers a counterbalance to the fast-paced, high-stakes world of innovation. By incorporating elements of his teachings, they aim to foster greater focus, creativity, and empathy within their organizations.","Neem Karoli Baba, an Indian mystic and spiritual leader, has left an indelible mark on some of the most influential figures in the global tech industry.

In an era where technology continues to reshape every aspect of our lives, the intersection of artificial intelligence and spirituality has become an intriguing topic of exploration. A recent experimental art installation in Lucerne, Switzerland, invited visitors to engage in thought-provoking conversations with an AI-driven avatar of Jesus, placed within the intimate setting of a confessional. This project, Deus in Machina, was designed to explore how AI could be used to address deeply personal questions about faith, morality, and the human experience. By offering responses grounded in biblical teachings, the installation provided an unconventional space for reflection, sparking discussions on the role of AI in religion and the boundaries of human trust in technology.The project, led by researchers and religious leaders, aimed to explore the growing intersection of artificial intelligence and religion. It also investigated the limits of human trust in machines, especially in a space typically associated with spirituality. After the exhibit, which ran from late August through October, over 900 conversations were transcribed, and those involved in the project considered it largely successful. Many visitors left with deep thoughts and emotions, noting that interacting with the AI was an easy and meaningful experience.A small sign outside the confessional invited visitors to enter, where a green light signified it was their turn to speak with the “AI Jesus” avatar. Behind a lattice screen — a familiar setup for those seeking traditional confession — the AI would respond with thoughtful answers. The response, however, wasn’t instantaneous, requiring a short wait time, which pointed to the complexities of the technology. Nearly 300 people filled out questionnaires after their interactions, contributing to the final report.Philipp Haslbauer, an IT expert from the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, explained the technology behind the AI, which used GPT-4 from OpenAI and an open-source version of Whisper for speech recognition. The visitors discussed a variety of topics with ""AI Jesus,"" including love, the afterlife, loneliness, war, and even controversial topics such as sexual abuse within the Catholic Church or the Church’s stance on homosexuality. Though most visitors were Christian, people from other faiths, including agnostics, atheists, and Buddhists, also participated. The AI was conversant in over 100 languages, including English, Chinese, Spanish, Russian, and many others.Some visitors reacted negatively, calling the project “blasphemous” or ""the work of the devil."" However, chapel theologian Marco Schmid noted that most participants engaged seriously with the AI, using the experience to reflect rather than make light of it. The majority of visitors were aged between 40 and 70, and the project appeared to resonate more deeply with Catholics than with Protestants. Schmid emphasized that the AI wasn’t intended to replace traditional confessions or spiritual guidance but to spark reflection on the growing role of digital technologies in spiritual matters.Schmid was careful to clarify that the “AI Jesus” was not intended as a replacement for religious rituals, and it was understood that it was a machine, not a living person. It didn’t offer absolution or prayers, only summarized the conversations. The project, a form of artistic exploration, sought to examine the relationship between digital technology and the divine, without suggesting it could replace authentic human connection.The broader Catholic Church, including the Vatican, has begun to explore AI’s potential and ethical implications. Since the explosion of public interest in AI technology, particularly after the debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT, religious leaders have debated AI's role in faith settings. For example, the Vatican has appointed a friar as its AI expert, and a Lutheran church in Germany experimented with AI-delivered sermons. Pope Francis, in his annual peace message, called for international regulations to ensure the ethical use of AI.Despite the fascination surrounding the project, concerns about AI’s impact on spirituality remain. Kenneth Cukier, a journalist and AI expert, suggested that if “AI Jesus” helps people connect more deeply with themselves and their faith, it could be a positive development. However, he cautioned that the risk is that it may ultimately draw people away from deeper, more authentic spiritual experiences. The machine-like quality of the AI could detract from genuine human spirituality, Cukier warned.Schmid views the Deus in Machina exhibit as a pilot project. While he doesn't anticipate an immediate return of “AI Jesus,” he acknowledged there is interest from various groups, including parishes and schools, in continuing to explore AI’s role in spiritual contexts. The project’s success has sparked reflection on how to proceed and whether future iterations might expand on the intersection of AI, religion, and art.","""AI Jesus"" sparks deep discussions on faith, morality, and technology. Over 900 conversations were transcribed, and those involved in the project considered it largely successful. Many visitors left with deep thoughts and emotions, noting that interacting with the AI was an easy and meaningful experience.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115815251,imgsize-17296,width-400,resizemode-4/115815251.jpg"

A new malware threat called GodLoader is targeting gamers worldwide, exploiting the popular Godot game development engine, a report has said. Check Point Research (CPR) uncovered this threat, which has already impacted over 1.2 million users across various platforms.According to the cyber security company, the discovery is worrying because it suggests escalation in cybercriminal tactics , leveraging trust in legitimate platforms to infiltrate the gaming ecosystem.The report by Check Point says that GodLoader specifically targets gamers who download mods and add-ons, exploiting their trust in the Godot Engine and open-source platforms.Since Godot-based games run on platforms like Windows, macOS, and Linux, a large number of users are prime targets. Additionally, the Godot Engine’s ability to execute cross-platform scripts allows attackers to infect a wide range of devices.The malware disguises itself as legitimate game updates or downloadable content, often spreading through trusted repositories on platforms like GitHub. Once installed, GodLoader can compromise personal data, execute malicious code, and potentially lead to ransomware attacks.Eli Smadja, a security expert at Check Point Software Technologies, warns that the gaming industry needs to prioritise cybersecurity measures to combat this growing threat.“The Godot Engine’s flexibility has made it a target for cybercriminals, enabling stealthy, cross-platform malware like GodLoader to spread rapidly by exploiting trust in open-source platforms. For the 1.2 million users of Godot-developed games, the implications are profound—not just for their devices but for the integrity of the gaming ecosystem itself,” he said.“This is a wake-up call for the industry to prioritize proactive, cross-platform cyber security measures to stay ahead of this alarming trend,” he added.","Malware called GodLoader is targeting gamers worldwide, exploiting the popular Godot game development engine.
