New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme . This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Claude 3.5: A basic guide to writing code using Claude 3.5,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/a-basic-guide-to-writing-code-using-claude-3-5/articleshow/111502364.cms,"Snip from TOI e-paper

How to start

Master prompts

We asked software developers how they would use an AI assistant like Claude 3.5 Sonnet for a coding project . A frequently cited starting tip is to break down a complex problem into smaller, manageable parts. Software development , especially at the enterprise level, is a complex orchestra of parts that need to come together, so whatever your coding task is for the day, you can always get help from an AI assistant, as long as you have a specific task in mind.Shauvik Mazumdar, senior director of front-end engineering at Ascendion, says he has been amazed by Claude 3.5 Sonnet’s capabilities in generating websites, apps, and even games. “With the recent addition of ‘ artifacts ,’ it allows us to view and interact with the results in real time too.”He says if Artifacts is not enabled, you should do that by going to the left sidebar, clicking on your name, and navigating to ₹Feature Preview’, where you have the enabling feature.The next step, Shauvik says, is to get back to the chat window and type a prompt to get your project started.If you’ve been tasked with creating a login page for a business, you could create a prompt like this:Design a login page (plain html). The login form needs to have a username and password as the first step. It also needs a ₹forgot password’ feature. Further on successful login, it should show Multifactor authentication. Use Material stylesheet and do basic validation. To test the system, you can use user name and default password like admin, admin and OTP as 1111. On successful login a message should be shown.“Claude will generate the code and an HTML version of the login page side-by-side.You can quickly test the output and instruct Claude to refine it. For plain HTML and vanilla JavaScript, Claude typically provides a demo. It can also generate Angular or React code, though not a live demo as of now,” says Shauvik.Once you have your code, test it, starting with small, isolated tests, before integrating it into larger systems, says Arun Prakash Agrawal, professor & head of the department of computer science & applications at Sharda School of Engineering and Technology in Greater Noida.Maintaining a comprehensive documentation of the code and decisions made during the project, Arun says, will aid in debugging and future maintenance.Mastering the art of writing prompts might be the most crucial skill to gain to make your coding journey more productive. This is the method by which a developer communicates with AI systems, and so being clear and concise is crucial.“Developers need to be specific, and provide proper context to a problem statement. Breaking down tasks, giving examples of similar codes, and asking for code comments will help the prompt responses to be more aligned with the desired outcome. A basic prompt can be refined through proper feedback,” says Deepak Visweswaraiah, VP of platform engineering, and site MD at Pegasystems, India.Vijay Navaluri, co-founder at Supervity, says structuring interactions as multi-turn conversations is also beneficial for complex tasks, as it allows the model to build on previous responses and maintain context.","Claude 3.5 Sonnet can generate websites, apps, and even games.

AI has become a crucial part of our present truth, remodelling industries and redefining the employment landscape. As AI continues to strengthen at an exponential scale, it is critical for experts to stay informed about the emerging job roles that will form the future of work. Here we look at four AI process titles which look set to play pivotal roles in the coming years.With the increasing integration of AI into various aspects of our lives, the need for responsible and ethical AI improvement has increased even more.AI ethicists are the guardians of this obligation, making sure that AI technologies are designed, developed, and deployed in a manner that upholds moral ideas and considers the societal impact.Examine AI systems for bias, broaden ethical frameworks, advise businesses on responsible AI practices, and engage in public conversations on AI ethics.A strong knowledge of ethical principles, understanding of AI technology, communication and critical thinking capabilities, and a background in philosophy, regulation, or social sciences are beneficial.AI algorithms, much like humans, require continuous training for better inferencing. AI engineers are the ones responsible for continuously training the AI models with relevant data and instructions for continuous upgrades.Prepare and label datasets, develop training parameters, continuously monitor, and evaluate model performance, and further fine tune algorithms to enhance model accuracies.Expertise in machine learning and deep learning techniques, data analysis, programming knowledge (Python, R), and familiarity with AI tools and technologies are desired skill sets.With AI-powered applications and devices becoming more prevalent, the necessity of seamless and intuitive human-computer interaction has increased.AI interaction designers bridge the distance between AI technology and their user interaction, creating user friendly interfaces and experiences.Design conversational interfaces for chatbots and digital assistants, develop consumer-focused frontend for AI products, and perform A/B testing to understand user needs and preferences.Expertise in user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design principles, knowledge of human-computer interaction, understanding of AI capabilities and limitations, and effective communication and collaboration skills are crucial for this role.Ensuring the safety and security of AI systems is of utmost significance. AI safety engineers are required to ensure that.Perform risk assessments of AI systems, develop safety protocols and mitigation techniques, put in place security features to defend AI systems from cyber threats, and stay up to date on the latest research on AI safety.A strong understanding of cybersecurity ideas, knowledge of AI algorithms and architectures, experience with cybersecurity testing and vulnerability assessment, along with problem solving and analytical skill sets are essential.Sukanya Mandal is a member of IEEE, the world’s largest technical professional organisation"," AI has become a crucial part of our present truth, remodelling industries and redefining the employment landscape.

Jayachandran Ramachandran: Claude 3.5 Sonnet sets new coding benchmarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/claude-3-5-sonnet-sets-new-coding-benchmarks/articleshow/111329656.cms,"Anthropic’s latest AI model , Claude 3.5 Sonnet , arrived seemingly out of nowhere last week, free to use for everyone, and is now setting new benchmarks in a number of metrics. Most notably, it aced the leader boards in key categories of the LMSYS Chatbot Arena , a benchmark used to measure large language model performance. Specifically, it secured the top position in the ‘Coding Arena’ and ‘Hard Prompts’ categories, beating industry behemoths like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro , all while being a lighter, faster model to run.Jayachandran Ramachandran , senior VP of Artificial Intelligence Labs for C5i, says the LMSYS Chatbot Arena is a crowdsourced open benchmarking platform and that users perform various tasks in pair wise comparison of models and provide feedback on which models can satisfactorily provide the best response. “The ranking system is quite transparent, robust, and reliable. In recent times, the top position was occupied by frontier models such as GPT-4 series and Gemini-1.5 series. It is a significant development for Claude 3.5 Sonnet to outsmart other leading frontier models and occupy the top position, especially in coding tasks,” he says.Saurav Swaroop , co-founder & CTO of financing platform Velocity, which recently launched Vani AI , a GenAIled customer calling solution for financial institutions, says that while GPT-4 has been assisting developers with writing code for some time now, it has been prone to errors and hallucinations. “However, Claude can write production level deployable code now. This will boost developer productivity and the time to build software will keep coming down,” he says.With its advanced reasoning skills, it’s great at handling multi-step workflows too, which is essential for complex projects, says Sourabh Kumar, senior manager of experience engineering for Publicis Sapient. “Compared to other industry leaders like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet offers faster processing speeds and higher accuracy in complex coding and reasoning tasks. For industries such as finance, where accurate data analysis is critical, or retail, where trend prediction can drive success, integrating Claude 3.5 Sonnet can lead to significant efficiency gains and innovation,” he says.Claude 3.5 Sonnet can also offer alternative solutions that coders might not have even considered, says Bebi Negi, senior lead data scientist at the Analytics Centre of Excellence for Happiest Minds Technologies.However, Bebi says coders will still need to check the code created by the model. “While it can create code quickly, it is very important to understand the code and make sure it meets a project’s requirements and standards. Even though benchmarks rate the model at around 90%, the remaining 10% gap underscores the necessity for coders to review the outputs,” she says.Securing the top spot in the Hard Prompts category was also a big deal, says Bebi. “The Hard Prompts category was all about handling complex tasks and instructions. The model did a great job here too, showing it can understand and generate high-quality content, even when the instructions are quite tricky.”","Anthropic’s latest AI model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, is now free to use for everyone.

GenAI: On-device AI is cheaper and faster than cloud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/on-device-ai-is-cheaper-and-faster-than-cloud/articleshow/111329501.cms,"As devices such as smartphones , laptops, tablets and cars become more intelligent and powerful with increased processing capabilities and sensors, the tech industry is focusing on harnessing the power of AI on the edge or on-device AI to come up with more context-aware personalised user experiences.And while AI may have started off as something very specific to image processing, it has over the past four to five years evolved and exploded, especially with GenAI coming into play, to include a lot more use cases around text processing, voice processing and multimodal use cases, said Rajesh Narayanan, vice president of engineering at Qualcomm .He was speaking on ₹AI on the Edge’ at the first edition of the ‘TechForward’ research seminar series launched by Indian Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIITH). The series seeks to spark regular and deep academia-industry conversations around emerging technologies.Narayanan pointed out that on-device AI has evolved to offer advantages such as personalisation , privacy and security, and with lower energy consumption and costs, and better performance compared to AI on the cloud.“Today, smartphones, smartwatches, devices that are a part of home automation, devices in the car and industrial IoT are equipped with plenty of cameras and sensors and are becoming a lot more powerful with the ability to collect more data. They also have more processing capacities, leading to more context aware user experience that can lead to a much better day-to-day life for all of us,” he said.He said that for all this to become a reality, you need a very powerful AI engine, and the overall solution has to be extremely power efficient.Personalisation is a key selling point for on-device AI as all the data that was earlier being sent to the cloud, potentially compromising privacy and security, can be done on the device. On-device AI also brings down energy consumption significantly compared to running workloads on a much bigger infrastructure like the cloud.Performance too improves as processing on the device itself can enable low latency as opposed to sending the query to the cloud, as with devices like Alexa.Narayanan said on-device AI is also a lot more affordable compared to the cloud. “As we transition from traditional AI to GenAI, the cost per query is actually going up and cloud economics isn’t going to work as compared to doing it on the device,” he said.In his talk on Vision on the AI edge’, Anoop Namboodiri , who heads the Biometrics and Secure Identity Lab and is associated with the Centre for Visual Information Technology at IIITH, said computer vision is playing a key role in pushing AI, and now GenAI.","The tech industry is focusing on harnessing the power of AI on the edge or on- device AI to come up with more context-aware personalised user experiences.

Service bots get our lingo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/service-bots-get-our-lingo/articleshow/111329125.cms,"Moving to complex functions

Indic language capability

is a little expensive now

The other day I decided to check out an airline’s chatbot to see how it works. I keyed in: “I’m travelling with my 8-year-old son, recommend the best flight without disturbing his sleep”. It asked for my source and destination, which I gave as Chennai and Hyderabad. It asked for the date. I typed ₹Mon’ (for Monday), but it did not recognise what I meant.I typed ₹tom’, it correctly recognised it as tomorrow.The bot responded that there were no flights that “fully meet” my specified criteria and provided a bunch of options. I then asked for the cheapest flight, and non-stop flights. The options it provided were correct – I confirmed that on MakeMyTrip and Google Flights. It automatically filled the passenger list as 1 adult and 1 child for booking. It even clarified the availability of gluten free food for my fictional son.Customer support bots have come a long way from the days of clunky bots that only answered FAQs. These sophisticated generative AI-based tools are much better than their predecessors, though still far from perfect. Sometimes they ask silly questions even after being explicitly told. They struggle to recognise colloquial words, have woefully poor memory, unlike human agents. But at least you don’t have to listen to hold music for 15 minutes.The leap comes from GenAI ’s ability to understand conversations better, their ability to understand multilingual queries , and support for interfaces like voice and videos. As these systems improve, customer support will become a lot quicker and easier for users, and hugely cheaper for companies, since they won’t have to hire thousands of contact centre staff.Ramprakash Ramamoorthy, director of AI Research at Zoho Corp, says with GenAI, the next goal is to make customer assistant bots do more complex and autonomous functions. He says they could hand over the issue to human agents when it figures it can’t handle it. He says they may even be able to process warranty claims, for instance. “As soon as you reach out, the system will be able to cross-check the database for similar issues/ queries where warranty claims are applicable. A human agent will have to call a supervisor to do the same job,” he says.But these are still some time away. Even for basic customer support services, companies are being careful due to concerns around data privacy, and hallucination. Nobody, after all, wants to get into a situation like Air Canada did earlier this year when its chatbot offered a discount to a customer that it wasn’t supposed to.Chaitanya Chokkareddy, cofounder of Ozonetel, the Hyderabadbased customer experience tech provider, says the focus currently is on automating the most common, repetitive queries. Chatbots, he says, fail in non-common areas of work.He says a lot of work is happening with AI in the back-end like data analysis, summary, intent analysis, and quality control, focusing on efficiency and productivity of human customer agents and improving margins of companies. “We handle about 20 million calls per day which last about 3 to 5 minutes each, and a lot of that data is currently not accessible to managers to make better decisions on their product and services. Demand for back-end services is higher than customer facing applications,” he says.While AI assistants perform relatively well in English, their performance in Indic languages is not great. Ozonetel is building Telugu language tokenisation by working with a non-profit and 1 lakh student interns to build a Telugu database. But Indian languages, he says, cost around 5x to 10x more compared to English because of the complex tokenisation of Indian languages compared to the Roman alphabet. “AI models are charged based on usage and chatbots using Indic scripts have more tokens and hence have higher computational costs. In many cases, the costs are equivalent to a human being and so our customers don’t want to automate,” Chaitanya says.Ankush Sabharwal’s CoRover.ai also has a local language model called BharatGPT. The bot can respond to voice queries in Indian languages, and provide tailored information. It also has video chatbots with pre-generated videos and text-to-video conversion and lip sync, which can be used for purposes like internal training.Ankush says redundant workload should be automated first, and as the adoption increases, more clear use cases will emerge. He says problems like hallucination can be reduced with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and use of domain-specific small models.Abhiroop Medhekar, founder & CEO of financing platform Velocity, says they have built text-to-speech and speech-to-text tech for AI-agent voice call automation. They initially used it internally and then started commercial offerings. “Some BFSI applications require an immediate response from customers, but customers frequently don’t respond to mails or WhatsApp reminders. The current robotic IVR calls are not effective either. But these GenAI-based voice calls are interactive and provide better results,” he says.","Chatbots have come a long way from the days of clunky bots that only answered FAQs.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

After years of Android users enjoying the convenience of glanceable directions, Google is testing Live Activities integration with Google Maps on iPhone.Earlier, iPhone users with Google Maps had to constantly unlock their phones to access real-time navigation updates.This could be disruptive and even dangerous while driving or walking. While some navigation apps offered on-screen directions, Google Maps remained a holdout.Live Activities, introduced with iOS 16 , allows apps to display real-time information directly on the lock screen and Dynamic Island (on iPhone 14 Pro models). With Google Maps testing this feature, iPhone users can expect to see the following directly on their lock screens:* Next turn directions: No more fumbling to unlock your phone to see where to turn next.* Estimated arrival time: Stay on top of your ETA with a quick glance.* Traffic updates: Be aware of potential delays and adjust your route accordingly, all without unlocking your phone.While the testing phase appears limited, reports from Reddit and other online sources suggest some iPhone users are already experiencing Live Activities with Google Maps. This integration will allow for a safer and more convenient experience, keeping users informed without the need to constantly switch between apps or unlock their phones.It's unclear when a wider rollout of Live Activities for Google Maps on iPhone will occur. However, the ongoing testing suggests Google is committed to enhancing the user experience for its iOS users.","Google is testing Live Activities integration with Google Maps on iPhone.

Apple MacBook Pro models with M4 chipsets: What to expect



Apple is expected to launch new MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models in the coming months. According to a report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the rumoured MacBook Pro and MacBook Air machines are likely to come powered by three variants of Apple’s M4 chipsets -- the base M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max chipsets. The report also notes that the upgraded MacBooks may retain their predecessor's designs and may even offer new features through an AI subscription service which is expected to boost sales.Rumours suggest that Apple will soon release 14-inch and 16-inch models of MacBook Pros with M4 chips by the end of this year or early next year. Moreover, MacBook Air sizes are also in line for an early 2025 refresh.Currently, the only Apple devices with the M4 chip are the newest iPad Pro models . The most affordable option is the 11-inch iPad Pro with 256GB of storage which was launched at Rs 99,900.Gurman claims that both the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air won't see any design changes despite getting upgraded to the M4 chipsets. This comes after the 2021 redesign of the MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.He also suggested that a more significant visual overhaul might be coming in 2026, potentially coinciding with the adoption of OLED displays similar to the latest iPad Pro models.Similarly, the MacBook Air is also expected to wait until 2027 for a design refresh, five years after it departs from the wedge shape.Gurman acknowledges that a chip upgrade alone might not be enough to entice existing MacBook users to upgrade.To address this, Apple is reportedly considering a monthly subscription service that builds upon the free Apple Intelligence launching this fall.Additionally, Gurman claims Apple might integrate and potentially take a commission on third-party AI services like ChatGPT, mirroring their App Store model.",Apple is expected to launch new MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models in the coming months.

Monitor account activity: Regularly review your credit card statements and transaction history for any unauthorised charges or suspicious activity.

Enable alerts: Set up transaction alerts through your bank or credit card issuer to receive notifications of any transactions made with your card.

Use strong and unique passwords: Secure your online banking and shopping accounts with strong passwords that include a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using information that is easily guessed, such as birth dates and names.

Enable 2-factor authentication: Utilise two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible to add an extra layer of security to your online accounts.

Be cautious of phishing scams: Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unsolicited emails, messages, or websites that ask for your credit card information.

Shop only on secure websites: Ensure that the websites you use for online shopping are secure. To ensure secure browsing, ensure that the URL contains HTTPS and a padlock symbol in the address bar.

Use virtual credit card numbers: Some banks offer virtual credit card numbers for online transactions. These are temporary numbers that cannot be linked to your actual credit card account.

Keep your devices secure: Install antivirus software, keep your operating system and apps updated, and avoid connecting to unsecured public Wi-Fi networks when making online transactions.

Shred personal documents: Shred any documents containing sensitive information such as credit card statements or receipts before disposing of them.

Report lost or stolen cards immediately: Contact your bank or credit card issuer immediately if your card is lost or stolen to prevent unauthorised use.

Credit card fraud involves cybercriminals obtaining sensitive credit card information such as the card number, PIN, CVV, and other necessary details to make unauthorised purchases or transfers.While credit card fraud detection systems can aid in identifying fraudulent transactions to some extent, fraudsters often manage to inflict substantial financial harm on victims before being apprehended.Therefore, it's crucial to familiarise oneself with various types of credit card fraud and take proactive measures to avoid becoming a victim. Being vigilant and informed can significantly reduce the risk of falling prey to such fraudulent activities.Despite the low or zero liabilities for credit card users, fraud or identity theft can still cause significant inconvenience for both customers and banks. While the bank's zero-liability policy protects credit card users from financial losses if they report the fraud within 60 days, they must endure the process of detecting the theft, notifying the bank, obtaining a replacement card, paying any associated fees, and updating all automatic payment accounts.The rise of awareness among credit card users is essential for early detection and prevention of fraud, helping banks address potential issues proactively.",The rise of awareness among credit card users is essential for early detection and prevention of fraud.

Apple iPhone 16 series is expected to launch in September and in the run up to the debut, the rumour mill is already churning out scores of leaks. According to another such leak, iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to get a boost in battery life .Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has said that the Cupertino-based giant is increasing the energy density of the battery cells of iPhone 16 Pro Max, which will result in longer battery life.“My latest supply chain survey indicates the energy density (Wh/kg) of the battery cells of iPhone 16 Pro Max will increase, which has the benefit of longer battery life with the same battery size or lower battery size with the same battery life,” he said in a post.However, with increase in energy density of the battery cells, there will be an increase in temperature when running. To tackle this, Apple will use the stainless steel battery case .“Increasing the energy density of the battery cells will increase the battery temperature when running. To avoid overheating the battery, Apple uses the stainless steel battery case for the first time as a thermal solution ,” Kuo said.While stainless steel may not be as effective as aluminium in dissipating heat, “it is more robust and less susceptible to corrosion, so in addition to dissipating heat, the stainless steel battery case provides better protection for the battery and the iPhone system.”Kuo noted that the use of a stainless steel battery case will reduce the difficulty of removing the battery, hence, helping Apple to “comply with the European Union’s requirements for mobile phone batteries’ replaceability in the future.”“If the mass production of this new battery design (upgraded energy density of battery cells & adoption of the stainless steel battery case) goes well and the feedback is favourable, this new battery design will be adopted in all 2H25 new iPhone models,” Kuo noted.The iPhone 16 series is rumoured to replace physical buttons with touch-sensitive buttons that simulate a press with haptic feedback. The camera layout might shift to a vertical design, unlike the current diagonal setup. The customisable Action button, currently on Pro models, might be available on all iPhone 16 models.Under the hood, the standard iPhone 16 and Plus models might use the A18 chip , while Pro models could get the A18 Pro chip. Meanwhile, the display size for iPhone 16 and Plus (6.1-inch and 6.7-inch) might remain the same, but the refresh rate could improve.","iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to get a boost in battery life.

Could the Big Dog and the Beast Incarnate form a coalition against WWE’s Bloodline 2.0?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/could-the-big-dog-and-the-beast-incarnate-form-a-coalition-against-wwes-bloodline-2-0/articleshow/111522267.cms,"Exploring the possibilities of a Tag-team of Roman Reigns and Brock Lesnar

Brock Lesnar and Roman Reigns are the only two individuals who’ve managed to conquer The Streak in the WWE . And despite these two stalwarts being managed by the same individual, Paul Heyman , they’re completely different personalities but command authority whenever the step into the ring.Now, it’s common knowledge that both the Big Dog and the Beast Incarnate have been at loggerheads with each other but, there’s a slim chance that the WWE could explore a storyline where these two start working together and eventually form a tag-team alliance.Although there’s a higher possibility of this coalition not happening, here are a few reasons why it could happen.First of all, both Brock Lesnar and Roman Reigns have had their differences with the Bloodline and the stable could threaten their standing in the WWE. Furthermore, Paul Heyman experienced a brutal beatdown by the Bloodline on June 28’s episode of WWE Smackdown, and that’s something that could irritate both Roman and Brock.Although they’ve had their own differences, at this point, exploring an angle where the two unite under the ambit of weakening the Bloodline could be one of the biggest storylines that WWE can explore at this point.Furthermore, both these individuals have different fighting styles and a unique set of problems that they bring to the table. So having them fight on the same side might yield some interesting spots during the matches. That said, their constant ego clashes could also lead to some compelling storylines in the coming months.It’s not that WWE hasn’t explored these lines in the past. They’ve done it with Kevin Owens and Randy Orton before, so it’s not something that the WWE Creative team will have to work too hard to establish. However, the two performers bring much more gravitas to the table, and while Orton and Owens are two extremely capable performers in the ring, their style is different from that of Reigns and Lesnar.Orton and Owens rely on a lot of mind games whereas Lesnar and Reigns are all about the Brawn, so that dynamic is something that’ll be very interesting to see, should WWE plan on executing it.That said, this is one plan that is unlikely to happen because WWE is planning on using the Bloodline to create a feud between Roman Reigns and The Rock, which is again an explosive angle. But it’ll be wrong to ignore the possibility of the Beast Incarnate and the Big Dog team up together to defend what can be termed as “their yard!”Also read: The Rock vs Roman Reigns plans revealed ahead of WrestleMania 40",Brock Lesnar and Roman Reigns are the only two individuals who’ve managed to conquer The Streak in the WWE.
