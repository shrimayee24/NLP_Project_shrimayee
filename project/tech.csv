Travis Hunter's Would-be Wife Leanna Lenee Seen Dancing “Inappropriately” With Another Man In A 3-year Old Video



Travis Hunter And Leanna Lenee Are Trying To Get Away From The Spotlight



Travis Hunter has deactivated his Instagram account in order to stay away from the spotlight on his would-be wife Leanna Lenee who has been on the receiving end of extreme amounts of hate and trolling due to certain controversial statements and actions of her. While Travis publicly defended his fiancee, his decision to deactivate his Instagram account came after a video resurfaced of Leanna dancing “inappropriately” with a SoundCloud rapper three years ago.The resurfaced video was posted by Akademiks TV’s X account where a woman who looks like Leanna Lenee is seen twerking next to a man at a party. Leanna is wearing a mini skirt and a top in this viral video. As soon as the video was uploaded, it went viral in no time with fans again beginning to troll Travis and especially his fiancee Leanna.This prompted Travis to immediately delete his Instagram account as it looks like he is not being able to deal with so much hate coming his way. A few days ago, Travis appeared in a podcast and opened up about how much the constant manipulative stories about his relationship, the extreme hate and trolling is “draining” him. Last week, Travis’ would-be wife uploaded a video on TikTok which was close to 10 minutes long where she made a bold statement and defended herself against the trolling she has received. Appearing teary eyed in that video, it seems like she expected people to stop trolling her after this video statement of hers.Unfortunately, luck was not in her favour as people started criticising her more. Unable to take the hate and criticism coming her way, Leanna decided to make her social media accounts private. As soon as the video of Leanna’s with another man went viral last night, fans were divided. While some supported Travis and spoke about how the hate is going beyond limits, some continued to troll Leanna. One user wrote about Travis and how it is “hell” for him by saying, “Ever since travis won that heisman they’ve been making him go through hell. This shit is insane”, another user also spoke about how this is very unfair to Leanna as the user wrote, “ATP yall making that girl suicidal, crucifying someone character because you don’t like how she interacts with her boyfriend who you don’t know is insane!Yall need help fr.”But many fans continued to hate on Leanna. A user wrote, “Most red flags in history and he still not gonna leave lol”, another user wrote about how this has become an “every day” thing by writing, “Same shit, different day”Also Read: Jordan Love reacts to the wild theory that his incredible season might have more to do with Toyota’s Toyotathon than anyone could have guessed Currently no official statement has been made by either Travis or Leanna on this matter.

Travis Hunter’s Fiancée’s Tattoo Has Sparked Controversy Amongst Fans



Travis Hunter’s Fiancée Continues To Get Hate



It seems like Travis Hunter’s fiancée Leanna Lenee just cannot escape the hate and trolling she has been receiving in the last couple of days. She is currently dragged into another set of controversies around a tattoo she has on her ring finger. The tattoo is of a “$” sign and has sparked controversy about her real intentions when it comes to being with the Heisman Trophy recipient.Fans are not happy with such a tattoo as many speculate it reveals the real reason as to why she has been dating Travis and is on her way to eventually marrying him next summer. Fans are speculating it is Travis’ fame and wealth that has attracted Leanna and she will leave Travis the day it all goes away. Many users took to X to discuss this speculation; one user wrote. “That's all she looking for”. Another user spoke about how Leanna is “using” Travis to network and make new connections, like a social climber. The user wrote, “He better get rid of her or she gonna leave for a bigger bag. He just a way into those rooms she won’t ever be in without him.!”Many fans of Travis were also worried about them as they believed he is too young and naive to understand what Leanna wants out of him. This also does not help the fact that Leanna is actually 2 years older than Travis. Leanna is currently 23 years old while Travis is 21 years old. The user wrote, “Simp hunter is baccccccckkkk. Let’s be for real, he’s only 21 years old and most guys don’t know shit until the of 33 or older. Pray for him though”This series of controversies began when Leanna did not stand up for Travis when he received the Heisman Trophy last Saturday. As per a viral video clip, Leanna stood up only after she was nudged by Travis’ coach, Deion Sanders. This did not go down well with Travis’ fans who already had a lot of issues with Leanna and have questioned Leanna’s “intentions” already a few times before.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes' wife Brittany Mahomes turns heads in a stunning custom jacket as she celebrates the Chiefs' big win with her family Leanna made a video last week on TikTok where she addressed all the hate and trolling she has received.

His wealth, fame, popularity, brand deals do not play any role when it comes to her feelings for him and her decision for marrying him, as per what Leanna said in the video statement. But even this video of hers got too much hate which ultimately forced Leanna to make her social media accounts private.",Travis Hunter’s fiancée Leanna Lenee has been dragged into another set of controversies around a tattoo she has on her ring finger.

"'No burgers, soft drinks and burgers': UK bans daytime TV ads for junk food in bid to tackle child obesity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/no-burgers-soft-drinks-and-burgers-uk-bans-daytime-tv-ads-for-junk-food-in-bid-to-tackle-child-obesity/articleshow/116004661.cms,"Rising child obesity in UK

What will be covered in the ambit of the ban?

The UK government has announced a ban on daytime TV adverts for sugary foods, including popular items like granola, muffins, and pastries, as part of its ongoing efforts to combat rising childhood obesity.News agency AFP reported that the new regulations, set to take effect in October next year, will restrict ads for “less healthy” food and drinks to airing only after the 9:00 pm watershed.The ban targets specific products identified as unhealthy based on their sugar, fat, and salt content, but does not apply to the broader advertising of fast food chains. For example, ads from fast food restaurants will remain permissible as long as they do not feature specific items like burgers or fries, according to a BBC report.Highlighting the importance of these measures, health secretary Wes Streeting said, “Obesity robs our kids of the best possible start in life, sets them up for a lifetime of health problems, and costs the NHS billions. This government is taking action now to end the targeting of junk food ads at kids, across both TV and online.”According to the National Health Service (NHS), obesity rates among children in the UK are on the rise, with one in 10 four-year-olds now classified as obese. Additionally, one in five five-year-olds suffers from tooth decay linked to excessive sugar consumption. The government’s new approach aims to address these alarming statistics and prevent further health complications down the line.The ban includes a variety of items that are commonly marketed to children, such as fast food, soft drinks, ready meals, and pre-packaged sugary breakfast foods. Products like croissants, pancakes, waffles, cereal bars, and sweetened yoghurts will be affected, alongside chickpea or lentil-based crisps, seaweed snacks, energy drinks, and processed foods like hamburgers and chicken nuggets.However, healthier alternatives will be exempt from the restrictions. Natural porridge oats and unsweetened yoghurt, for instance, will not fall under the new rules.The government hopes that by reducing the exposure of children to these adverts, it can help prevent an estimated 20,000 cases of childhood obesity each year.","The UK government has announced a ban on daytime TV adverts for sugary foods.

Zara Dar: PhD scholar who gave up academia to become an OnlyFans model,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/meet-zara-dar-phd-scholar-who-gave-up-academia-to-become-an-onlyfans-model/articleshow/116599381.cms,"PhD dropout to OnlyFans model

In a surprising career shift that has sparked widespread discussion, Zara Dar , a former PhD student and content creator from Austin, Texas, has traded her academic pursuits for a full-time career in digital content creation—and with remarkable success. The multi-talented Dar, who holds degrees in bioengineering and computer science, has earned over $1 million through her work on platforms such as YouTube and OnlyFans.Dar initially gained recognition for her educational YouTube channel , where she simplified complex scientific concepts and shared insights into subjects such as neural networks, gradient descent algorithms, and probability. Her engaging teaching style and ability to make STEM topics accessible to a wider audience garnered her a devoted following among students and science enthusiasts alike.However, in December 2024, Dar announced her decision to leave her PhD program. The announcement was met with a mix of support and surprise from her followers. She cited her desire for greater autonomy and financial independence as key reasons for her departure from academia.“I realized that I could have a broader impact and achieve financial freedom by focusing on my online platforms,” Dar shared in a candid video post. “It was a tough decision to leave something I’ve worked so hard for, but ultimately, this path allows me to be more creative and in control of my future.”Dar’s move into content creation has been nothing short of lucrative. Her presence on OnlyFans, a platform often associated with adult content but also used for niche and creative pursuits, has drawn significant attention. Dar has managed to build a diverse audience by combining her STEM expertise with a personal approach, offering subscribers both intellectual and light-hearted content.Her success has reignited conversations about the evolving landscape of career paths in the digital age. Platforms like YouTube and OnlyFans have given individuals the tools to bypass traditional career routes, enabling them to monetize their skills and personalities directly. For Dar, the transition represents not just a financial windfall but also a challenge to societal expectations surrounding academic achievement and career success.Critics, however, have questioned whether her decision undermines the value of traditional education. Dar has addressed such concerns by emphasizing that her academic background was integral to her success as a creator. “My education taught me how to think critically and solve problems,” she said. “Those skills are universal and have helped me navigate this new phase of my life.”Beyond her digital platforms, Dar has expressed interest in using her earnings to fund STEM initiatives and scholarships, particularly for underrepresented groups in science and technology fields. “Education and empowerment remain core values for me,” she explained in a recent interview. “I want to give back in a way that helps others achieve their dreams.”Zara Dar’s story underscores the shifting dynamics of professional success in an era dominated by social media and online entrepreneurship. As traditional and digital worlds continue to intersect, her journey serves as both an inspiration and a case study in the power of adaptability and self-determination.","Zara Dar is a former PhD student and content creator from Austin, Texas.

As Christmas approaches, many countries put their own unique twist on the holiday season. While Santa and his reindeer are the stars in most places, several countries feature traditions that might surprise you. Here are some of the most unusual Christmas customs from around the world:San Francisco’s annual SantaCon takes a different approach to holiday tradition: many participants dress up as Santa – or not at all. The event has become famous for participants who join in the fun in the nude, adding a unique twist to the Christmas festivities.In Catalonia, families celebrate with the ""Tió de Nadal,"" or the ""pooping log."" The tradition involves a wooden log with a painted face and red hat, which is ""fed"" treats throughout December. On Christmas Eve, children gather to beat the log with sticks to make it ""poop"" out candies and small gifts.Iceland’s Yule Cat (Jólakötturinn) is a large feline creature that, according to legend, hunts down people who haven’t processed their wool by Christmas. Those who haven’t completed the task risk being eaten by the cat. Most Icelanders, however, make sure to get their wool ready in time to avoid this fate.In Italy, the holiday season extends until January 5 with the arrival of Befana, a kindly witch who delivers gifts on Epiphany Eve. Legend has it that Befana missed the birth of Jesus, and to make up for it, she brings treats to children, along with coal for the naughty ones.In Wales, the Mari Lwyd tradition features a horse skull decorated with ribbons and mounted on a pole. The Mari Lwyd visits homes, challenging homeowners to a rhyming duel. If the homeowner wins, they’re invited inside for food and drink.In Japan, fried chicken, particularly from KFC, is the go-to Christmas meal. This tradition began in the 1970s thanks to a successful marketing campaign, and it’s now so popular that many families book their KFC Christmas meal weeks in advance.In Caracas, Venezuela, it’s common for families to roller-skate to Christmas Mass. This tradition helps avoid traffic and adds some festive fun to the holiday celebrations.","San Francisco’s annual SantaCon takes a different approach to holiday tradition: many participants dress up as Santa – or not at all.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Meta Ray-Ban glasses with display: What to expect

Facebook-parent Meta is reportedly planning an upgrade for its Ray-Ban glasses. Rumours claim that these smart glasses may soon feature a display. A new report suggests that the next-generation model could launch by 2025. The current model supports voice commands and audio feedback. A display will not only improve the user experience by allowing more intuitive interactions and visual information but will also help the Meta Ray-Ban glasses with Apple’s mixed reality headset, Vision Pro.Using the glasses' reading feature is often convenient, but there are situations where a visual display proves more efficient. People can typically read text faster than it can be narrated, making the option important.According to a report by the Financial Times, this functionality is expected to arrive soon. The report claims that this upgrade marks a major step in Meta’s efforts to develop lightweight headsets that replace smartphones as consumers’ primary computing devices.The report cites sources familiar with the plans to claim that the social media giant is planning to integrate a screen into the $300 (above Rs 25,000) sunglasses it produces in collaboration with eyewear manufacturer EssilorLuxottica.The upgraded Ray-Ban glasses could launch as soon as the second half of 2025, featuring a small display designed to showcase notifications or responses from Meta’s virtual assistant.Similar to the Vision Pro, the Meta’s smart glasses are also unavailable in India.Previously, Meta unveiled an early prototype of its Orion AR glasses. Although the design is admittedly bulky and comes with a reported manufacturing cost of $10,000. However, the prototype offered a glimpse into the potential of augmented reality in a form factor closer to the existing Ray Ban smart glasses.Apple is also believed to share a similar vision, with its long-term goal reportedly focused on developing AR glasses. The Vision Pro is seen as an initial step on the path toward the anticipated Apple Glasses. While voice interaction will likely be a key feature, Apple is expected to prioritise integrated displays in its designs.",Facebook-parent Meta is reportedly planning an upgrade for its Ray-Ban glasses.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

These iPhones to lose WhatsApp support in 2025



WhatsApp will no longer support Android devices running on KitKat or older versions from January 1, 2025. The decision is part of Meta's efforts to maintain compatibility with newer technologies and ensure the app's security and functionality. Released in 2013, Android KitKat is an outdated operating system that lacks the capabilities to support WhatsApp's latest features and security updates. The discontinuation of support will affect several older Android devices , including models from Samsung, LG, and Sony. However, all of these phones are not currently available in India, yet, users are advised to upgrade their devices to newer Android versions to continue using WhatsApp.According to a report by HDBlog, WhatsApp will stop working on smartphones that still run the Android KitKat version. Here is a list of those smartphones:However, this is not the first time older smartphones will lose support for WhatsApp as Meta has a history of discontinuing support for older operating systems. The company regularly reviews its minimum requirements for Android and iOS to maintain compatibility and security standards. In recent years, Meta has phased out support for older iOS devices and earlier Android versions.Earlier, WhatsApp announced that it will stop supporting older iOS versions starting in 2025. Starting May 5, 2025 devices running iOS versions earlier than 15.1 will no longer be able to access the app, including through older beta versions on TestFlight.While WhatsApp currently supports iOS 12 and above, the upcoming changes will require iOS 15.1 as the minimum version for continued functionality. To give users time to adapt, WhatsApp is providing a five-month notice period, allowing them to update their devices or explore other options if their hardware cannot support the latest iOS versions.This update will mainly affect users of older iPhones, specifically the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus, which are limited to iOS 12.5.7. These models, released over a decade ago, represent a small segment of WhatsApp’s user base. For users with newer iPhones still running older software, upgrading to iOS 15.1 or higher will ensure uninterrupted access to WhatsApp.The changes will impact both the standard WhatsApp app and WhatsApp Business, as both rely on the same system requirements. With this move, WhatsApp aims to enhance performance, security, and compatibility for users on modern devices.","WhatsApp will no longer support Android devices running on KitKat or older versions from January 1, 2025.
