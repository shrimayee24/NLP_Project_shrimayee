“Your ability to manage a hybrid team of human and AI resources will play an essential role in the success of the company’s employees.""

4 tips Marco Argenti shared with Goldman Sachs' employees



“get creative with AI, posing provocative, non-obvious questions.”

“While AI excels at refurbishing existing knowledge its true creative potential is unlocked by human curiosity,""

“The expert will curate a personal toolkit of models and assistants and know[s] which one to deploy for which task,"" he explained

“plausible-sounding errors.”

“A blend of deep knowledge and a detective’s scepticism,”





Goldman Sachs chief information officer (CIO) Marco Argenti believes professionals can succeed in the AI-driven workplace by focusing on collaboration and questioning rather than competing with machines. In a recent company Briefings newsletter (as seen by Fortune), Argenti outlined four strategies on how employees canas autonomous systems take on tasks previously reserved for humans. Argenti's advice centres on adapting to the AI transition by learning how to conduct, question, and collaborate with the new technology. This approach is intended to help professionals thrive as AI reshapes workplaces globally. In the newsletter, Argenti wrote:Argenti suggests that today’s professionals need to shift from simply executing tasks to coordinating them. Success, he explains, will depend less on individual output, such as writing code or performing analysis and more on managing agile teams composed of both human and AI contributors. Effective leadership will involve delegating, coordinating, and integrating their work to achieve outcomes that neither could reach alone.According to Argenti, curiosity is one of the most valuable human abilities in an AI-driven world. He encourages employees toWhile AI systems are strong at processing existing information, they rely on human curiosity to spark new ideas. By asking imaginative, unconventional questions, people can help AI move beyond familiar patterns and reveal deeper insights.Argenti wrote.Argenti also recommends that professionals use a mix of AI tools tailored to specific tasks rather than relying on a single platform. No one model performs best in every situation, he notes. The advantage lies in understanding which tools are most effective for particular purposes, such as data analysis, writing, or coding and combining them into a personalised digital toolkit.Argenti further warns that even advanced AI systems can generateAs these tools become more integrated into work processes, checking their accuracy will require domain expertise and careful evaluation.he writes, will help distinguish reliable insights from misleading ones.Argenti concludes that AI is not replacing human ability but changing how it is defined. The future, he says, will favour those who combine technical understanding with creativity, critical thinking, and leadership qualities that remain uniquely human.","Goldman Sachs CIO Marco Argenti outlines four strategies on how employees can succeed in the AI-driven workplace.

"Milestone for AI in science: Google AI generates cancer hypothesis later validated by scientists, says Sundar Pichai",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/milestone-for-ai-in-science-google-ai-generates-cancer-hypothesis-later-validated-by-scientists-says-sundar-pichai/articleshow/124599530.cms,"

How Google AI is decoding cancer through cellular language



Discovery of a potential cancer therapy pathway



Transforming scientific discovery



Open access for global collaboration





In a significant development for AI in biomedical research, Google ’s C2S-Scale 27B foundation model, developed in collaboration with Yale University and based on the Gemma framework, has successfully generated a novel hypothesis about cancer cell behaviour. This hypothesis was later experimentally validated in living human cells, marking an important step forward in the integration of artificial intelligence with laboratory science.Google CEO Sundar Pichai hailed the development as a major advance in the partnership between AI and laboratory science. He emphasised that the discovery could guide future preclinical and clinical research, potentially revealing new pathways for cancer therapy.At the core of this achievement is the C2S-Scale 27B model’s exceptional capacity to ""understand"" biology. The AI system was trained on over one billion single-cell profiles and transforms raw molecular data into what researchers call “cell sentences.” With this approach, the AI can interpret cellular communication and context, essentially learning the “language” of cells.As biotech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson explained, the model “listened” to what cells were signalling and produced a hypothesis that real biological experiments later confirmed.This fluency in cellular patterns marks a turning point for AI’s role in biomedical discovery, enabling it to reason about complex systems and propose new ideas rather than simply summarising existing knowledge.The C2S-Scale 27B model produced a hypothesis suggesting that the drug silmitasertib could significantly boost antigen presentation in cancer cells by almost 50% under conditions of low interferon. Antigen presentation is the process by which tumour cells display fragments of abnormal proteins on their surface, signalling the immune system to recognise and attack them. By enhancing this mechanism, silmitasertib could make previously “invisible” tumours detectable to immune cells, strengthening the body’s own ability to fight cancer.Experiments conducted in human cell models confirmed the AI’s prediction. This finding is particularly promising for tackling “cold tumours,” a type of cancer known for bypassing immune detection and resisting conventional therapies. If these results are validated in further preclinical and clinical studies, they could open the door to new immunotherapy approaches, offering fresh hope for patients with cancers that are notoriously difficult to treat.This milestone represents a turning point in how AI can contribute to medical research. Rather than merely analysing existing datasets, AI systems like C2S-Scale 27B are now capable of generating entirely new scientific hypotheses, bridging the gap between computational prediction and experimental validation. Researchers emphasise that extensive preclinical and clinical testing is still essential before these AI-driven insights can translate into viable treatments for patients.Even so, this achievement demonstrates the transformative potential of AI as a true partner in science, capable of accelerating discovery, sparking innovation, and guiding research in ways that were previously unimaginable.In an effort to democratise cutting-edge biomedical research, Google has made the C2S-Scale model publicly available on platforms such as Hugging Face and GitHub. This transparency allows scientists worldwide to explore the model’s capabilities, test its predictions, and build upon its foundation.","Google’s C2S-Scale 27B foundation model has successfully generated a novel hypothesis about cancer cell behaviour.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

Rise of Chinese AI chip companies

China to tech companies: You cannot buy AI chips from Nvidia





Nvidia, the American semiconductor giant, has seen its dominance in China’s advanced chip market vanish, with its market share dropping from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls, according to CEO Jensen Huang. Speaking at a Citadel Securities event in New York earlier this month, Huang revealed that Nvidia is completely barred from selling its high-performance AI chips, including the A100, H100, and H200 models, to Chinese companies since restrictions began in 2022.A video of the interview was released recently. Huang expressed hope for a policy shift, stating, “We will continue to explain and inform and hold on to hope for a change in policy.” He emphasized that Nvidia’s exclusion from China not only harms the company but also has broader implications for both China and the U.S. “What harms China could oftentimes also harm America, and even worse,” Huang said. He further highlighted China’s significant role in global AI development, with roughly 50% of the world’s AI researchers.Nvidia CEO's remarks come as China carries on with a nationwide push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.Chinese AI and semiconductor contenders have rushed to launch domestic alternatives, eroding Nvidia’s once-dominant market share. Huawei’s advancements, including clustering methods to bypass Nvidia’s technology and cutting-edge manufacturing techniques, signal China’s aggressive push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.Despite receiving US approval to sell a less powerful H20 chip tailored for the Chinese market, Nvidia faces further challenges. Chinese authorities launched a security investigation into the H20, and local clients were advised to avoid the product, further limiting Nvidia’s foothold. Huang warned that excluding Nvidia from China risks ceding the market to domestic competitors like Huawei Technologies, which recently unveiled an ambitious AI chip roadmap.“It’s a mistake not to have those researchers build AI on American technology,” Huang said, raising concerns about balancing U.S. technological leadership with global collaboration. As China accelerates its domestic chip development, Nvidia’s absence from the market could reshape the global AI and semiconductor landscape.Nvidia recently got shut out of the Chinese market after China’s internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, reportedly banned domestic tech companies from buying Nvidia AI chips. According to a report by Financial Times, the Chinese agency also told tech companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to stop testing and ordering Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D server, a device designed specifically for the market in China.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang revealed that the company is barred from selling its high-performance AI chips to Chinese companies.

Who are the Talibros? Meet the content creators braving Afghanistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/who-are-the-talibros-meet-the-content-creators-braving-afghanistan/articleshow/124609483.cms,"Taliban Fighting India’s Proxy War Against Pakistan, Says Khawaja Asif Amid Afghan Ceasefire Doubts

The Big Picture



What’s Happening



Why It Matters



The Background



What’s Next







It’s the kind of video you’d expect to stumble upon on a jihadist message board in 2004: three hooded hostages kneeling, their captors standing grim-faced behind them, Kalashnikovs poised like punctuation marks. The lighting is harsh, the script familiar — a finger jabs at the air, a threat is uttered, and you brace for the worst.Except this time, the script flips. The hood comes off, and instead of a terrified prisoner, there’s an American influencer with a movie-star grin and a cheery “Welcome to Afghanistan!” The scene cuts to pull-ups on tank barrels, selfies with Kalashnikovs, and tourists laughing in the shadow of a regime that once banned music and stoned women.This is not satire. It’s marketing — part of a growing trend in which a new breed of social-media provocateurs, dubbed “Talibros,” are repackaging Taliban-controlled Afghanistan as the ultimate offbeat travel destination. Their content straddles the line between shock humour and soft propaganda, turning a war-scarred theocracy into a backdrop for clout-chasing, contrarianism, and a very modern kind of ideological theatre.The Talibros are not journalists, historians, or analysts. They’re content creators — mostly men, mostly Western — who package Taliban-ruled Afghanistan as the ultimate contrarian experience. Their message is simple and seductive: everything you’ve heard is wrong.They insist that women aren’t oppressed because they’re visible in marketplaces. That Taliban fighters aren’t dangerous because they crack jokes on camera. That a country that banned female education past the age of twelve and removed women’s books from universities is simply “misunderstood.”The aesthetic is part Vice gonzo reporting, part frat-house vlog, and part soft-focus propaganda. And it works — because it flatters an audience exhausted by “mainstream narratives” and eager to believe that they, not the gullible masses, are finally seeing the “real story.”Aryubi’s video was just the start. Addison Pierre Maalouf, better known as Arab to his two million YouTube subscribers, shot to fame touring Afghanistan’s “women’s markets.” He mugs for the camera, pretending astonishment that women speak in public, while an overlay of a Western news headline flashes on screen: Taliban Bans Women from Speaking. The implication: media hysteria. The reality: women remain subject to draconian restrictions, their public presence tightly policed and their educational prospects gutted.Meanwhile, Kurt Caz, a South African travel vlogger, shifted from filming dangerous neighbourhoods in Venezuela and Kenya to walking the streets of Frankfurt with far-right activists, complaining about “illegal migrants” and dubbing the city “Crackfurt.” The pivot is revealing: the Talibros no longer just document “risk” abroad — they now weaponise it at home, warning young Western men that their cities will collapse too.It would be comforting to dismiss this as fringe stupidity — testosterone tourism with a side of irony. But the Talibros are playing a bigger game. They’ve mastered the algorithmic dark arts of the attention economy: weaponise distrust, monetise outrage, and flatten complexity into punchy, meme-able contrarianism.They know that traditional media is suffering a credibility crisis. Only a quarter of under-50s say they trust the news to report “fully and fairly.” Into that vacuum step the self-anointed truth-tellers, promising real insight while building parasocial empires on YouTube and Patreon. Once viewers stop trusting journalists, they don’t turn sceptical — they turn loyal. Loyal to them.The irony is that the Talibros aren’t selling reality at all. They’re selling a feeling — the dopamine hit of believing you’re in on a secret, that you’re smarter than the “sheeple.” And the deeper that feeling runs, the harder it is to shake.Travel content has always flirted with danger — explorers trekking through war zones, vloggers sneaking into North Korea, influencers chasing adrenaline in “forbidden” places. But the Talibros have twisted that instinct into something more ideological.They’re heirs to a lineage of online provocateurs — Andrew Tate, Sneako, and the wider “red pill” sphere — who discovered that contrarianism isn’t just viral, it’s profitable. And they’ve applied that playbook to geopolitics: destabilise consensus, cherry-pick anecdotes, mock expertise, and present yourself as the only reliable narrator.Political economist William Davies captured this shift in Nervous States: when objective truth collapses, intuition becomes king. Facts don’t matter; vibes do. And nobody manipulates vibes better than a charismatic man with a GoPro, a grievance, and a Taliban escort.The Talibros are unlikely to fade — if anything, they’re a preview of the future. As platforms reward outrage over nuance and audiences grow hungrier for “unfiltered” content, the algorithm will keep boosting their blend of irony and ideology. Mainstream influencers like the Nelk Boys and Jake Paul, once prank-peddlers, are already edging into similar territory.The danger isn’t that audiences will start idolising the Taliban. It’s subtler — and more corrosive. It’s that they’ll stop believing anyone but the provocateurs. That truth will become just another aesthetic choice. That everything — beheadings, misogyny, religious extremism — will be reduced to content.And once that happens, the Talibros won’t just be influencers with a gimmick. They’ll be architects of a new kind of ignorance — one that laughs as it rewrites history, monetises trauma, and sells a war-torn nation as the latest backdrop for a YouTube thumbnail.","A new breed of social-media provocateurs, dubbed ‘Talibros,’ are repackaging Taliban-controlled Afghanistan as the ultimate offbeat travel destination.

UK launches first digital ID: Is it similar to India's Aadhaar? Full details of the plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-launches-first-digital-id-is-it-similar-to-indias-aadhaar-full-details-of-the-plan/articleshow/124630189.cms,"AI image used for representative purpose

Why UK government launched this plan



What is the use of ID?



How Veteran can use access digital IDs?



Is it similar to India?







The UK government launched the digital version of its ID scheme on Friday, intended for former members of the armed services.This ID will mean passports, driving licenses, national insurance cards, and many more being virtual, instead of—or as well as—being stored in a shoebox or under socks in a drawer, Sky News reported.The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.The govt claims the initiative is designed to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for those without status to secure employment.Ministers contend that the ability to obtain jobs is a primary attraction for migrants entering the UK unlawfully. Under the new system, employers will no longer be able to depend on National Insurance numbers—which currently serve as part of proof of the right to work—or on paper-based verification methods, BBC reported.""At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy—people sharing National Insurance numbers for example. The idea is that having a picture attached would make it—in theory—harder to abuse that system,"" a government spokesperson explained.The digital IDs, which will be app-based and stored on smartphones akin to the NHS App or digital bank cards, will contain information such as the holder's residency status, name, date of birth, nationality, and a photograph.Sir Keir, when announcing the scheme, stated: ""You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that.""From today, Friday 17 October, it will give ex-soldiers a seamless way to confirm their status in person and will include information already featured on their physical card with the security features that protect their personal information.Ministers hope the digital veteran card will show how the technology works and quash public concerns about privacy and security.Veterans will now be able to hold their credentials in a smartphone app called Gov.uk One Login. The govt had previously announced that digital credentials, including the veteran card, would be stored in an app named Gov.uk Wallet. It now states it will “transition to talking about [One Login] as the Gov.uk Wallet” as more govt-issued credentials become available digitally. The credential will be stored under encryption in the app, similar to how a train or concert ticket is held in an Apple or Google wallet, The Guardian reported.Verification using face ID or a fingerprint will be required to access it, and the govt claims it is safer than physical IDs. Another version of the credential will be held by the Ministry of Defence, and as more IDs are added, the information will remain with each issuer and in the citizens’ app, ensuring there is no central database of all ID data, thereby avoiding what some have feared could be a “honeypot for hackers”.India has well established digital ID system. India’s digital ID system, Aadhaar, is significantly larger and more detailed than the UK’s planned system.New Delhi stores citizens’ fingerprints, eye scans, photos, home addresses and phone numbers, with the system processing approximately 80 million authentications daily.Under Aadhaar, every Indian citizen receives a 12-digit number intended to replace numerous paper documents. All adults and children over the age of five must provide biometric information. The system verifies identities for activities such as opening bank accounts or applying for new SIM cards. It also aimed to streamline the disbursement of govt benefits, providing holders with instant proof of identity and access to basic services.Aadhaar and UK's digital ID seems to be same.India also have other apps like DigiLocker, where you can store all the important documents like Aadhar Card, Pan card, driving license digitally at one place, Digi Yatra and many more.The UK's digital ID seems to be following the similar model of India. Like DigiLocker, UK is introducing Gov.UK Wallet. Few days ago, UK PM Keir Starmer made his first trip to India and hailed India’s ID system as a “massive success”.During his trade-centric visit to Mumbai, Starmer also met with Nandan Nilekani, co-founder and chair of Indian tech services group Infosys, who led the govt body responsible for delivering the ID database more than a decade ago.",The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.

Who is Niklas Elmehed: The man behind the iconic illustrations of the 2025 Nobel laureates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/who-is-niklas-elmehed-the-man-behind-the-iconic-illustrations-of-the-2025-nobel-laureates/articleshow/124624619.cms,"Niklas Elmehed’s journey to the Nobel laureates illustrations



Behind the scenes





When the world tunes in every October to see the latest Nobel Prize winners , the first images that greet audiences are not photographs but striking gold-and-black portraits. Behind these instantly recognisable illustrations is Niklas Elmehed, a Stockholm-based visual artist and Art Director at Nobel Media AB. Known for combining classical portraiture with modern illustration, Elmehed has been creating the official portraits of laureates since 2012, turning the announcement of the world’s most prestigious awards into a visual spectacle. Working under strict confidentiality, he completes each hand-painted portrait within hours of learning the winners’ names, ensuring the images reach a global audience almost instantly.Elmehed studied fine arts in Sweden and brings extensive experience in digital and print design. His work spans journalism, history, and fine art, capturing the achievements of leading scientists, writers, and peace advocates in a single, iconic image. As Art Director at Nobel Media AB, he oversees all visual content for Nobel announcements, blending precision, storytelling, and aesthetic appeal to create portraits that convey both dignity and immediacy.Before Elmehed, Nobel laureate announcements often relied on low-quality photographs sourced from institutional websites. He introduced hand-painted portraits with black outlines on a white background, accentuated by shimmering gold foil. This design, formalised during the Nobel Prize’s 2017 graphical rebranding, adds a timeless quality and a sense of prestige, symbolising the legacy of the Nobel tradition while giving each laureate a unique visual identity.Secrecy is a key part of Elmehed’s process. He is among the very few outside the Nobel committees to learn winners’ names in advance. Working under tight deadlines, he paints rapidly without compromising detail or quality. His portraits are completed just in time for the announcements, allowing media outlets worldwide to immediately share the iconic images alongside the news.In 2025, Elmehed unveiled “The Golden Wall”, exhibiting all Nobel portraits of the year at Nobel headquarters in Stockholm. This year’s portraits, including Medicine laureates Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi, were shared across official Nobel social media platforms. Beyond the Nobel Prize, Elmehed has showcased his work internationally, from TEDxPatras 2025, where he discussed the storytelling power of faces, to a live painting performance at the Nordic Pavilion of World Expo 2025 in Osaka.For Elmehed, each portrait is more than art; it is a form of visual storytelling. He aims to produce works that reflect the immediacy of breaking news while immortalising laureates with elegance and clarity. His goal is to give each portrait a strong and unique visual impression, capturing the world’s foremost minds in a style that is instantly recognisable and timeless.","Niklas Elmehed is a Stockholm-based visual artist and Art Director at Nobel Media AB.

Crowded areas require attention to personal safety. Families with children should stay alert, especially near fireworks zones or food stalls. Respect cultural and religious diversity:



The spirit of Diwali should be one of inclusivity, not inconvenience. Any public celebrations should aim to bring people together rather than create noise or disruptions.





As of 2025, Dubai’s population has crossed seven million, and nearly two million Indian expatriates make up the city’s largest and most close-knit community. For them, Diwali is far more than a festive occasion — it’s a vital cultural anchor in a city defined by ambition and relentless pace.Every year, Dubai lights up with Diwali celebrations that span the entire spectrum: spectacular public events with government-approved fireworks and laser shows, elaborate displays in shopping malls and hotels, and intimate gatherings across Indian residential hubs such as Bur Dubai, Karama, and Discovery Gardens.But behind the glow lies a framework of order. Dubai’s strict regulations govern everything from firecracker use and event permits to public safety and crowd control.The big question every Diwali celebrant asks is simple: Are fireworks banned in Dubai? The answer is both yes and no. While private use, sale, and possession of fireworks are strictly prohibited, licensed and government-approved venues are permitted to hold official pyrotechnic displays.This means fireworks can light up the sky, but only where authorities have given explicit permission. Illegal fireworks, whether set off in residential areas or sold without a license, are treated as explosives under UAE law.Penalties include up to 3 months imprisonment or a fine of up to AED 5,000 for selling, using, or distributing fireworks. Additionally, parents can be held legally accountable if minors are involved in illegal fireworks use.Ahead of Diwali, authorities conduct rigorous enforcement campaigns, seizing illegal fireworks to prevent unsafe neighborhood celebrations. Residents are encouraged to report any suspected illegal activity through the Dubai Police app or by calling 901.For those legitimately aiming to host fireworks displays, securing a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority is strictly mandatory. However, this legal option is limited to licensed businesses only, specifically for entertainment purposes—not individual residents. The simple application process is straightforward, involving online registration, instant approval upon payment, and a small fee structure that includes AED 2,000 plus minor administrative and processing charges.In essence, fireworks in Dubai are a privilege reserved for official, regulated events. This tight framework reflects the city’s commitment to safety, order, and respect for its diverse population during Diwali.So, where can you dive into the Diwali fun and catch dazzling fireworks lighting up the Dubai sky? The city has confirmed several key spots where fireworks displays and vibrant festivities will take place. These government-approved events are free and open to everyone, offering fantastic opportunities to engage with the celebrations and enjoy the festival’s sparkle.The authorized fireworks schedule for Diwali 2025 is as follows:Visitors should plan to arrive early given the expected large crowds. Dubai Police and the Department of Economy and Tourism (DET) actively monitor these venues to maintain safety and crowd control.But Diwali in Dubai extends beyond fireworks. Several key locations offer vibrant cultural experiences throughout the festival:The waterfront transforms into a cultural Diwali village with traditional décor, floating diyas, heritage market stalls, and live performances as part of the immersive Noor Festival experience from October 17–19.The Indian Pavilion comes alive with cultural dance shows, handicrafts, vibrant décor, and street food. Fireworks light up the sky on select nights, making it a festive hotspot for all ages.Home to the spectacular IMAGINE light and fountain show synced to Bollywood hits, the mall also features Diwali-themed shopping deals, Indian food pop-ups, and family-friendly entertainment across the promenade.Expect Diwali-themed light projections on the world’s tallest tower and musical performances at the Dubai Fountain, offering dramatic visuals and ideal photo backdrops for visitors and residents alike.These buzzing neighbourhoods are a sensory overload of lights, music, and colour. Streets overflow with sweet shops, festive markets, traditional attire, and last-minute Diwali shopping well into the night.Together, these venues reflect the city’s vibrant, multicultural embrace of Diwali, catering to families, expatriates, tourists, and long-term residents alike.Among the many vibrant Diwali festivities across the city, one stands out as the official, government-backed centerpiece: Noor: Festival of Lights, running from October 17–19 at Souk Al Seef. Organized by the Dubai Festivals and Retail Establishment (DFRE) under the Department of Economy and Tourism (DET), in partnership with the Indian Consulate and Teamwork Arts, this spectacular flagship event transforms the historic waterfront into a lively cultural Diwali village filled with music, art, and community spirit.Highlights include:“Noor,” meaning “light” in Arabic, embodies the spirit of Diwali, symbolizing unity, renewal, and togetherness. Organizers present it as a “home away from home” for Dubai’s Indian community and a celebration that bridges cultures within the city’s diverse fabric.As the city comes alive with lights, music, and celebration, there's also a growing reminder: Diwali in Dubai isn’t just about enjoying the spectacle—it’s about doing so responsibly. In a place as diverse and densely populated as this, festivities should uplift the community experience, not disrupt it. Authorities and civic leaders are urging residents to be mindful, respectful, and clean as they take part in the celebrations.Dubai’s law enforcement and safety departments will be closely monitoring public areas during Diwali. Residents are encouraged to enjoy all official events but are reminded that any illegal or inconsiderate behavior will be met with firm action.","Dubai’s confirmed Diwali fireworks will take place at Al Seef on October 17 and Global Village on October 18, 19, 24, and 25.

Opening in Abu Dhabi’s Saadiyat Cultural District, the Zayed National Museum will offer a comprehensive and immersive journey through the history of the United Arab Emirates. Honouring the legacy of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the museum is set to become a cultural cornerstone reflecting the UAE’s past, present and aspirations for the future.Set to welcome visitors on December 3, 2025, the Zayed National Museum will stand as the official national museum of the United Arab Emirates. Located in the Saadiyat Cultural District in Abu Dhabi, it is dedicated to the life, vision, and values of the UAE’s Founding Father, the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.Developed under the Department of Culture and Tourism – Abu Dhabi, the museum is envisioned as a space where history, culture and innovation converge. Mohamed Khalifa Al Mubarak, Chairman of the department, described it as a living institution that tells “the story of our land, our people, and our heritage” in a way that is inclusive, evolving, and grounded in knowledge and education — values Sheikh Zayed upheld throughout his life.The opening date — December 3 — is symbolic, falling just before UAE National Day, further emphasising its role as a national tribute.According to an official post by the Abu Dhabi Media Office, the launch also marks the city’s strengthened position as a global hub for cultural dialogue and education.The museum was designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Lord Norman Foster of Foster + Partners. The structure reflects both modern sustainability practices and deep cultural roots. One of its most distinctive features is five towering steel structures designed to resemble falcon wings in flight, symbolising falconry’s importance in Emirati tradition.Spanning a carefully curated pathway, the museum experience begins at Al Masar Garden, a 600-metre landscaped route starting from the Saadiyat coastline. It connects the Louvre Abu Dhabi to the Zayed National Museum and the upcoming Natural History Museum Abu Dhabi.The garden features native plants from desert, oasis, and urban environments, along with a working falaj irrigation system, sculptures, multisensory installations, and a timeline highlighting Sheikh Zayed’s life and milestones in UAE history. This outdoor gallery sets the tone for the immersive historical journey that continues inside.Inside, the museum will showcase over 3,000 artefacts, of which 1,500 will be on display. These objects were chosen for their ability to convey the stories of the land and its people, from ancient times to the modern UAE.Together, these galleries form a chronological, thematic, and sensory-rich narrative of the UAE's past, guided by Sheikh Zayed’s enduring influence.To mark the inauguration, a comprehensive programme of performances, tours, workshops, and interactive activities will offer visitors a wide range of experiences.

Dubai deploys fully autonomous AI traffic system to detect road violations in real time without human input,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-deploys-fully-autonomous-ai-traffic-system-to-detect-road-violations-in-real-time-without-human-input/articleshow/124596890.cms,"Dubai unveils Intelligent Traffic System (ITS) at GITEX Global 2025, an AI traffic system automating traffic surveillance. Image: X

A smarter approach to road safety

Real time detection of five critical violations

Not wearing a seatbelt – Detects whether drivers and passengers are properly restrained. Using a mobile phone while driving – Monitors for illegal mobile phone usage during vehicle operation. Obstructing traffic flow – Flags unnecessary actions that impede smooth traffic movement. Stopping in the middle of the road without valid reason – Identifies vehicles halted inappropriately on roadways. Tailgating – Detects failure to maintain safe following distances between vehicles.

Instant updates and in-depth analytics

Supporting Dubai’s smart city goals





Dubai has introduced a fully autonomous Intelligent Traffic System (ITS), leveraging artificial intelligence and real-time video monitoring to identify and document major traffic violations instantly. Unveiled at GITEX Global 2025, the system aims to transform road safety enforcement and streamline traffic operations across the emirate through automation and smart data use.Dubai Police’s newly launched ITS operates without human intervention and is designed to detect traffic offenses as they happen. Built as a unified digital platform, the system incorporates live surveillance feeds and advanced data analytics to monitor driver behavior and flag violations.The ITS represents a significant shift in how traffic laws are enforced, moving routine tasks from field officers to an AI-driven system. According to Lieutenant Engineer Ahmad Al Hammadi, the automation of these responsibilities frees up police personnel for more strategic duties, ultimately improving operational efficiency and decision-making. He described the system as “smarter, fairer, and more efficient,” underlining its role in supporting Dubai’s broader vision to become a globally recognised smart and safe city.The Intelligent Traffic System is engineered to target five specific driver behaviors that have been identified as major threats to road safety:Each violation is captured in real time using AI-analyzed footage and immediately logged into the system with high accuracy.One of the system’s standout features is its ability to provide live updates on the number of vehicles being monitored and the violations recorded at any given moment. This constant stream of data gives authorities an up-to-date view of traffic compliance levels across the city.Beyond real-time monitoring, the ITS generates comprehensive statistical data on vehicle movement patterns. The analytics are broken down across different timeframes - hourly, daily, and yearly, allowing traffic planners to understand behavioral trends and optimize enforcement strategies accordingly.The statistical output is also crucial for improving emergency response capabilities by identifying congestion hotspots and predicting areas where quicker interventions may be necessary.The launch of the Intelligent Traffic System is in alignment with Dubai’s long-term objectives to enhance road safety and efficiency through digital transformation. By automating key aspects of traffic enforcement, the platform not only reduces the margin for human error but also introduces a fairer, more transparent and accountable mechanism for holding drivers responsible.As the system gradually scales and integrates further into city-wide operations, it is expected to serve as an effective model for other modern urban centers aiming to implement smart traffic governance through advanced technology.","Dubai Police’s newly launched ITS operates without human intervention and is designed to detect traffic offenses as they happen.

A vision endorsed at the highest level







The stadium: Fully air-conditioned, retractable pitch, and more

Location and long-term development: Zayed city and beyond









Commercial ecosystem: Integration with real estate and community infrastructure





If you’re curious about Abu Dhabi’s latest big sports project, here’s what you need to know: a brand-new, fully air-conditioned stadium is coming for Al Jazira Club. But this isn’t just a new home for the team—it’s designed to be a lively community hub, hosting events all year round. Located in Zayed City, this stadium reflects the UAE’s drive to take sports and public life to the next level.Earlier this month, on October 7, 2025, UAE President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan personally reviewed the design and master plan for the new Al Jazira Club Stadium. This event was more than ceremonial—it marked the public unveiling of a highly anticipated project intended to redefine Abu Dhabi’s sporting landscape.The stadium is being built under the direct supervision of His Highness Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Vice President, Deputy Prime Minister, and Chairman of the Presidential Court. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2026 and is projected to take three years, with completion expected in 2029.The new stadium isn’t just about football—it ties into the UAE’s bigger goals. It’s part of a national push to get young people more involved in sports, make public spaces more vibrant, and use sports as a key part of the country’s growth.It also fits into wider efforts to support innovation and aim for top-tier standards across the board.The upcoming stadium will have a base capacity of 24,000 seats, expandable to 30,000 to accommodate larger events. One of its standout features will be fully air-conditioned seating areas—a crucial consideration in the region’s climate. The stadium will also incorporate a retractable pitch, a dynamic design element that allows the playing surface to slide completely out of the arena when not in use. This ensures maximum flexibility for non-sporting events and maintenance.Additionally, the stadium complex will offer dedicated hospitality services for spectators. These will include premium zones, restaurants, and lounges designed not only for match days but also for year-round use. These venues will remain open outside event times, aiming to convert the facility into a community and lifestyle hub rather than a single-purpose sports venue.While no architectural renderings have been published by the club as of now, images from the October 7 review event show President Sheikh Mohamed examining detailed design plans—signaling that the project has entered a decisive phase of planning.The stadium is set to rise in Zayed City, a planned development in the southern part of Abu Dhabi that’s being shaped as a key urban centre for the future. The project isn’t just adding a sports venue—it’s expected to help drive growth and activity in the area.Once complete, the new stadium will become the new home of Al Jazira Club, replacing their long-time base at Mohammed bin Zayed Stadium, where the team has played since 1980. That stadium was expanded in 2009 to hold around 36,000 spectators, and it already includes air-conditioned stands. But this move signals a shift toward a more modern, flexible, and multi-purpose setup.And it’s not just about football. While Al Jazira competes in the UAE Pro League, the club is also active in volleyball, handball, and basketball. The new venue could support these sports too—positioning it as a broader home for top-tier sporting events across disciplines.Alongside the stadium build, Al Jazira Club is also thinking bigger—with plans that go beyond just sports. In September 2025, the club partnered with MAIR Group, a strategic investment company that focuses on grocery retail and commercial real estate.As part of the deal, Makani Real Estate, a division of MAIR Group, has been given 80,000 square metres of land right next to the new stadium site. The ambitious plan? To turn that space into a fully integrated modern commercial centre.

TAMM App’s process for fast, legal online marriages

UAE leads the Gulf with remote weddings





Couples in Abu Dhabi can now get legally married with just a few taps on their phones, thanks to the innovative marriage service launched on the government’s TAMM app - all for Dh800 (approximately $217). The all-digital service enables couples anywhere in the world to complete their marriage legally through a secure online ceremony, marking a new milestone in the emirate’s drive for smart government services.The TAMM app, which consolidates over 1,100 government and private sector services onto a single platform, now offers this seamless marriage solution under the supervision of the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department. Through a WebEx video link, the couple, two witnesses, and a licensed officiant join the wedding ceremony virtually. Even guests can participate remotely, eliminating the need for physical presence anywhere in the UAE. For couples residing abroad, a power of attorney can represent them locally during the ceremony.Describing the feature as a matter of convenience, Hammad Alhammadi, executive director of customer care and happiness sector at TAMM, said, “Even if you visit Abu Dhabi, you are able to log into and transact on services through Tamm, and one of them will be the marriage contract,” and added, “It's getting a lot of momentum right now.Maybe [it loses the romance] if you're getting married, but can also be very helpful. ”Couples seeking attested marriage certificates can pay an additional Dh300 for the app to automatically attest the document through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and deliver a secure digital version. Instead of traditional physical stamps, the marriage certificate now carries a UAE Pass digital signature. The entire streamlined process from document submission to ceremony scheduling can be completed within 24 hours if couples book an appointment in advance and have all necessary paperwork.To safeguard legal compliance and prevent underage or forced marriages, the marriage service is integrated with the UAE Pass and Emirates ID systems, verifying applicant identities and eligibility.Mohamed Al Askar, who heads the Abu Dhabi government TAMM application, told AFP at the Dubai-based Gitex Global 2025 tech fair: ""It's open to everyone. Whoever wants to get married in Abu Dhabi, regardless of their nationality, can get the service online. People can go online, they can do the whole transaction without the need to go to any physical place. We are among the first to do that.""The UAE stands out as the only Gulf nation allowing foreigners to enter into non-religious marriages, and this latest initiative reaffirms Abu Dhabi’s leadership in digital public services. Inspired by preliminary online marriage services introduced during the Covid-19 pandemic and modeled on innovations from countries like Ukraine, Abu Dhabi’s digital wedding experience is among the world’s first to facilitate fully remote, cross-border civil marriages.Lauding the transformative nature of TAMM AutoGov, His Excellency Ahmed Tamim Hisham Al Kuttab, Chairman of the Department of Government Enablement - Abu Dhabi, told Timeout: “The launch of TAMM AutoGov is truly transformative, redefining what government means in people’s lives. Here, government is no longer reactive. It’s a partner that is intelligent, human-centered, and present at the moments that matter most. With the world’s first transactional AI public servant, Abu Dhabi is showing the world what anticipatory government looks like.”In essence, Abu Dhabi’s new online marriage service through the TAMM app offers couples a modern, convenient, secure, and legally recognized way to wed quickly—whether they’re residents, citizens, or overseas—with full government backing, official support, and digital certification that embraces the future of smart, innovative governance while ensuring a seamless experience for users.",Abu Dhabi launches online wedding service via TAMM app. All-digital service enables couples anywhere in the world to complete their marriage legally through a secure online ceremony.

Creative workshops like rangoli and diya decoration, along with storytelling sessions, bring alive the theme of light triumphing over darkness. Special assemblies highlight the cultural heritage behind the festivities, encouraging appreciation and inclusivity among the diverse student population. During the break, families typically gather for prayers, share sweets, light lamps, and embrace the joy that Diwali brings.The UAE lights up with a colorful plethora of Diwali events every year, showcasing its multicultural essence.

UAE: Too good to be true? Sharjah Police warn of ‘dream car’ scams targeting buyers and sellers online,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-too-good-to-be-true-sharjah-police-warn-of-dream-car-scams-targeting-buyers-and-sellers-online/articleshow/124573542.cms,"Scammers use professional car photos and ultra-low prices, along with pressure tactics like “many are interested,” to trick buyers into paying deposits before vanishing/ Representative Image

How the scam works: A ""dream car"" that disappears after the deposit

A Tempting Dream – A product that feels out of reach is suddenly available at an irresistible price;

A Symbolic Price – So low it suspends disbelief and encourages rapid action;

Flashy Photos – Professional visuals add legitimacy to the fake listing.

Sellers also targeted: Fake payments and forged documents used to steal vehicles

The real defence: Verification, caution, and critical thinking

For buyers:





View the vehicle in person before making any financial commitment;

Request and inspect ownership documents;

Verify the identity of the seller, including matching ID to vehicle registration;

Be cautious of suspiciously low prices, especially those paired with pressure tactics.

For sellers:





Do not release the vehicle until payment is confirmed and cleared in your bank account;

Treat all payment confirmations and receipts as suspect until verified with your bank;

Be wary of buyers using urgency or false documentation to push early handovers.

For all users:





Sharjah Police encourage anyone who encounters a suspicious listing or request to report it immediately by calling 80040, the designated hotline for such fraud cases.

Authorities take action: Public warnings and swift arrests





In a sharp warning to the public, Sharjah Police have exposed a rising wave of highly orchestrated online vehicle scams targeting both buyers and sellers. The frauds, which prey on emotions and override logical decision-making, have led to significant financial losses across the UAE. As part of their proactive response, Sharjah Police released an official awareness video cautioning residents to carefully verify every step and promptly report suspicious activity without delay.The fraudulent scheme typically begins on popular classified platforms or social media, where visually polished ads present luxury or desirable vehicles at prices far below market value. The low price point is not accidental—it is designed to sidestep skepticism and provoke emotional decisions.Victims report being lured by high-quality car images, quick responses from the ""seller,"" and urgent messaging claiming other buyers are interested. This pressure, often phrased as ""first to pay gets the car,"" manipulates urgency, pushing the buyer to act without verifying the offer.Once a deposit is transferred, communication ceases. Calls and messages go unanswered, and the advertisement vanishes. In nearly all cases, the car is non-existent, and the fraudster is unreachable.According to Sharjah Police, the scam is structured around a pattern of psychological triggers:Police stress that this tactic isn’t random—it’s a deliberate attempt to bypass logic and exploit emotional vulnerability. Victims aren’t just deceived; they’re manipulated into self-convincing belief.In a separate but connected criminal scheme, sellers of vehicles have also become victims. A criminal gang, recently apprehended by Sharjah Police, targeted private sellers through platforms where vehicles are listed for sale.The perpetrators would express interest, make an attractive offer, and follow up with a falsified payment receipt claiming that funds had been transferred and were awaiting deposit. Using forged identification and persuasive communication, the scammers would convince the seller to hand over the car, believing the payment was in progress.In reality, no money was ever transferred, and by the time the scam is uncovered, the vehicle is gone.This variation of the scam highlights how both buyers and sellers are vulnerable in digital transactions—particularly in unregulated online environments where identity and payment verification are minimal or entirely absent.To combat this rising threat, Sharjah Police are calling on the public to remain alert and follow essential verification steps before engaging in any online vehicle transactions.In response to the increasing frequency of these crimes, Sharjah Police have intensified public awareness campaigns, including the release of an official video outlining the key tactics scammers use. These efforts aim to educate the public about how modern frauds rely more on emotional manipulation than obvious deception.A senior police officer explained that many victims “failed to verify and didn’t ask”, emphasizing that excessive trust and lack of due diligence are the two main vulnerabilities exploited.Police have also acted swiftly in high-profile cases. In one instance, a criminal group running an online car scam was arrested within just 12 hours. This shows the authorities’ strong commitment to curbing economic crimes in the digital space.","Sharjah Police have exposed a rising wave of highly orchestrated online vehicle scams targeting both buyers and sellers.

Riyadh, get ready to sashay! The city’s biggest fashion week is about to turn up the heat with Vivienne Westwood and Stella McCartney, two style legends are set to headline the event, promising jaw-dropping designs, cultural fusion, and sustainable glamour like never before.Riyadh Fashion Week 2025 is not just another event on the fashion calendar; it's a bold statement. From October 16 to 21, the Saudi capital transforms into a sartorial playground, featuring over 30 runway shows, designer presentations, and citywide activations. This year's edition marks a significant milestone as it welcomes international fashion icons Vivienne Westwood and Stella McCartney to the Kingdom's fashion stage for the first time.The style revolution kicks off on October 16 with a show that's pure, electric fusion: the Middle Eastern runway debut of Vivienne Westwood. But this isn't just a transplant of a London catwalk. In a move that brilliantly honors local artistry, the house is collaborating with Art of Heritage by Princess Noura Al Faisal.Imagine: iconic British punk aesthetics, the rebellious cuts, the historical references, the sheer attitude—set against the serene backdrop of a Riyadh palm grove.The collection will feature specially created embroidered gowns, a direct result of mixing Westwood's couture team's expertise with the exquisite craftsmanship of local Saudi artisans. It's a ""global-local"" philosophy brought to life, a powerful cultural exchange that doesn't just showcase fashion, but actively fosters and empowers Saudi heritage and craftsmanship for a global audience. Get ready for a breathtaking blend of anarchy and elegance.Dame Vivienne Isabel Westwood (1941–2022) was not born into high society; she came from a modest working-class family in Tintwistle, Derbyshire, England. Her father worked as a storekeeper and her mother was a skilled weaver. Westwood's achievements are marked by a unique blend of anarchy, historical reference, and fierce activism. She defined the look of punk, introducing anti-establishment imagery, bondage gear, safety pins, and provocative slogans to fashion. After punk was widely co-opted, Westwood turned to history for bold inspiration. Her first official runway collection,(1981), launched the influential ""New Romantic"" movement. Subsequent collections revived historical cuts like the bustle and the mini-crini, cementing her global reputation as an innovator who fused history with contemporary rebellion.Bringing the spectacular week to a thoughtful and luxurious close on October 21 is the regional debut of Stella McCartney. As a pioneer of sustainable luxury, McCartney's presence underscores Saudi Arabia's bold step toward conscious creativity and an eco-friendly future in fashion.Her show will be a curated presentation of her recent and archival collections, a masterclass in fashion that proves you don't need to sacrifice animals or the planet for show-stopping style. From her famous commitment to cruelty-free materials to her innovative use of recycled and responsible fabrics, McCartney's finale is a powerful statement. Her debut cements Riyadh Fashion Week as a platform not only for style but for substance, emphasizing the Kingdom's commitment to building a modern fashion ecosystem rooted in ethical and future-facing values.Stella Nina McCartney CBE (born 1971) was born into a world of both celebrity and conscious living. She is the daughter of The Beatles' legendary singer-songwriter Sir Paul McCartney and the late American photographer and devoted animal rights activist, Linda McCartney. McCartney's career is defined by her unwavering commitment to ethical sourcing and sustainable innovation.While the international icons are drawing the global gaze, Riyadh Fashion Week remains fiercely dedicated to shining a brilliant light on the incredible talent thriving within the region. Over 30 runway shows and presentations will celebrate a diverse lineup that spans high couture, contemporary ready-to-wear, and street-smart menswear. Prepare to be wowed by established Saudi brands like the elegant couturiers Tima Abid and Atelier Hekayat, the sustainable chic of Abadia, the modern design of Hindamme, and the experimental streetwear of 1886.

AI takes office: Abu Dhabi unveils world’s first AI-powered public servant at GITEX Global 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/ai-takes-office-abu-dhabi-unveils-worlds-first-ai-powered-public-servant-at-gitex-global-2025/articleshow/124556927.cms,"Abu Dhabi’s TAMM AutoGov is world’s first AI public servant / AI-generated illustrative image

TAMM AutoGov: Abu Dhabi unveils the world’s first AI public servant

What TAMM AutoGov will do for citizens?

Less paperwork and fewer missed deadlines for residents.

Faster processing of basic services (licences, permits, renewals).

More personalised notifications for example, reminders timed to your preferences.

How it’s built and who’s behind it?

Ethics, privacy and the practical checks citizens should watch for

How and where their data is stored and who can access it.

What “automation levels” mean in practice (which actions are fully automatic vs. prompted).

How to correct mistakes if the AI completes a service incorrectly.

Why this is different and what to expect next?





Imagine your driving licence renewing itself, or bills getting paid before deadlines that’s what Abu Dhabi’s new AI-powered public servant TAMM AutoGov promises, marking a new era of proactive governance unveiled at GITEX 2025.At GITEX Global 2025, Abu Dhabi rolled out TAMM AutoGov, described by authorities as the world’s first transactional AI public servant a major upgrade to the TAMM super-app that lets government services act proactively on behalf of people. The launch is part of Abu Dhabi’s broader plan to become an “AI-native” government by 2027 and is presented as a move from reactive service delivery to “anticipatory governance. ”TAMM AutoGov is built to reduce routine friction by automating recurring tasks and offering proactive service prompts. Examples given by officials include renewing licenses, managing scheduled payments and completing multi-step transactions with user consent. Users can set personal preferences and choose automation levels — meaning the system could, with permission, complete some services for you before you ask.The aim is to make government touchpoints faster, personalised and less dependent on repeated manual requests.Why this matters in plain terms:Abu Dhabi’s rollout doesn’t stand alone — it’s backed by major industry partners and a strategic technology push. The Department of Government Enablement (DGE) is working with global vendors and local partners to embed AI and cloud infrastructure that meet sovereign security needs. Industry collaborations announced around the same time (including work with NVIDIA and Oracle on sovereign AI infrastructure) point to high-performance computing and cloud platforms powering these services. This combination aims to deliver scalable, secure AI services that handle sensitive public data while running complex models fast enough to enable real-time automation.An AI that acts for you raises immediate questions, consent, data use, transparency and error handling. Officials stress that TAMM will allow users to set automation levels and personal preferences, but citizens should still check:Because the initiative handles transactional public services, independent audits, clear opt-in flows, and human-in-the-loop safeguards will be crucial to trust and legal compliance. Abu Dhabi frames this program as secure and sovereign, but observers and residents should watch the published privacy policies, service-level commitments and any third-party audits.Abu Dhabi isn’t just adding a chatbot, it’s attempting systemic change: move public services from “respond when asked” to “anticipate and act.” If successful, the model could cut friction for routine tasks, improve uptake of entitlements, and reduce backlog in public services. Expect a staged rollout, early pilots for low-risk services, and growing visibility of the technology stack and governance safeguards as it expands. Keep an eye on future announcements about scope, third-party audits and how citizens can control or opt out of automation.","TAMM AutoGov is the world’s first transactional AI public servant.

Taj Mahal Noodles - “Taste of the Heritage”: Instant noodles with a picture of the Taj Mahal and a promise of “authentic Indian spices.” Tastes suspiciously like chicken ramen with coriander dreams.

Bollywood Pickle - Jar label: a dancing couple, tagline: “Spicy Like Cinema!” It’s mango achar that smells like a film set and tastes like drama.

Royal India Biscuits: Manufactured in Ajman, “imported from India” (questionable), these biscuits come in tins showing tigers and temples. The flavor? Vanilla-ish nostalgia.

Mysore Rose Body Lotion (Made in Oman) : Because nothing says “India” like an Omani lotion that smells like grandma’s wedding perfume.

Desi Detox Drink: Tulsi-Lemon-Chia Fusion, a modern miracle drink that no Indian has ever heard of, but every wellness influencer in Dubai swears is “ayurvedic.”

Indian Frozen foods that defy expectation

.

The Unlikely Suspects: You walk past the frozen Okra (Bhindi) and Drumsticks (because who has time to chop that ?), and then you see them: trays of Frozen Gajar ka Halwa (carrot pudding). Yes. A dessert that takes four hours of slow simmering is now a pop-it-in-the-microwave affair. Who buys this? Everyone.

The Tiffin Box Time Warp: Another unexpected hero is the individually packed, frozen 'Mini-Meals' or thalis . These aren't fancy; they're the food equivalent of a comfort blanket, containing exactly two rotis , a dollop of dal , and a generic vegetable curry. They exist because the alternative is spending your one weekend day cooking seven meals.

They exist because the alternative is spending your one weekend day cooking seven meals. The Frozen Samosa Pyramid Scheme: The sheer volume of frozen samosas and kebabs sold in the UAE is a phenomenon in itself. They're sold in colossal, family-sized packs, often manufactured in a nearby country just to keep up with the overwhelming, year-round demand for instant, deep-fried comfort.

The unseen force: Why are people eating this?

thalis

The 9-to-5 Compromise: The biggest force is the Relentless Work Schedule. When you're working 9-to-5 (or 9-to-9) in Dubai, convenience trumps authenticity. It’s a choice between a 5-minute frozen thali and ordering another pricey takeaway. The freezer wins.

and ordering another pricey takeaway. The freezer wins. The Nostalgia Shortcut: These products are shortcuts to memory. The texture might be slightly off, but the Masala Magic is still there. These are culinary emotional support animals.

The UAE Logistics Mastermind: This is the ultimate comedy of the UAE market. If someone, somewhere, in the two million-strong Indian community, demands a frozen item, the market will find a way to import it, manufacture it, and stock it even if it's the most time-consuming dessert ever conceived. The demand is so high, it's a guaranteed profit. The market is literally bending to the will of nostalgia.

Weird demands from non-desi shoppers

The ""Mild Curry Powder"" Mission: Foreigners walk in demanding the ""safest, least spicy curry powder."" The staff, who measure chili heat on a scale that goes up to ""Volcanic Eruption,"" will hand them a bag labeled ""Daily Mild Masala,"" which is still spicy enough to activate a smoke alarm. The hilarious reality is that even the mildest option is a culinary challenge, reinforcing the idea that Indian food simply refuses to be truly bland.

The Search for 'The Sauce' : After eating pani puri on the street, tourists often return searching for the ""green liquid that tasted like mint and heaven."" They aren't looking for pudina chutney; they are looking for The Elixir of Life, and they can't quite describe the exact combination of herbs, tamarind, and chili required. The staff often just hand them a generic, slightly sweetened coriander sauce, knowing they'll never quite replicate the street vendor magic.

The Dettol Dilemma: Non-Desi shoppers are constantly mystified by the huge stock of original, powerful Dettol bottles.

They often buy it out of pure curiosity, wondering why the cleaning aisle smells like a hospital.





Walk into any “Indian grocery” in the UAE, and you’ll instantly feel two things: nostalgia and mild cultural whiplash. The smell of cardamom and detergent hits you, Bollywood songs play from a small Bluetooth speaker, and you spot a pack labelled “Taj Mahal Pasta – Real Indian Taste. ”Wait… pasta? Taj Mahal ?

When will the Arc de Trump be built? What’s next?





Throughout history, rulers have sought to immortalise their reigns through monumental architecture. From Napoleon’s Arc de Triomphe to the Pyramids of Giza, grand structures have stood as both symbols of power and markers of cultural identity. In Washington, presidents have long left their mark in stone and design, and the White House under President Trump’s hand—drawing on his background in real estate—has already been a canvas, transformed with gilded offices, a paved Rose Garden, and other signature modifications. Now, he is preparing to make what may be his boldest stroke yet: the Arc de Trump, a triumphal arch that would rise over the capital as a defining landmark for the nation’s 250th anniversary of independence.The announcement came on October 15, 2025, during a donor dinner in the East Room of the White House. According to USA Today, the audience included executives from Amazon , Apple, Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Palantir, alongside Lockheed Martin and the Gemini twins, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. The evening served both to thank donors for their support of a $250 million, 90,000-square-foot White House ballroom and to introduce the arch project, which Trump framed as a monumental addition to the capital.Trump showcased three 3D models—small, medium, and large, noting that the largest was his preference. Renderings, created by the Harrison Design firm, depicted a stone arch topped with a golden Lady Liberty flanked by two eagles. The design drew inspiration from Paris’s Arc de Triomphe and Brooklyn’s Grand Army Plaza Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Memorial Arch.Harrison Design partner and principal Nicolas Leo Charbonneau shared the same image on X in September, describing it as “a proposal for a triumphal arch in DC for #America250” and adding, “America needs a triumphal arch!”During the presentation, Trump emphasized the arch’s intended role as a gateway to Washington, positioned to greet visitors entering via the Arlington Memorial Bridge and standing prominently across from the Lincoln Memorial. He highlighted that the site, Memorial Circle, had long been considered for a landmark, and framed the arch as a ceremonial and symbolic anchor for the city, meant to mark the nation’s 250th anniversary on July 4, 2026. According to the Washington Post, the project was recommended to Trump by Justin Shubow, president of the National Civic Art Society, as a fitting commemorative landmark for the anniversary.The Arc de Trump is planned for Memorial Circle, at the southern end of the Arlington Memorial Bridge, directly facing the Lincoln Memorial. Trump remarked, “Every time somebody rides over that beautiful bridge to the Lincoln Memorial, they literally say, ‘Something is supposed to be here.’”Once erected, the arch would be impossible to overlook. Positioned at the southern end of the Arlington Memorial Bridge, the structure would rise dramatically from Memorial Circle, a historic traffic roundabout located just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. This prominent location would ensure the arch dominates the approach to the capital, greeting every visitor crossing from Arlington National Cemetery.In early 3D mockups photographed on Trump’s desk in the Oval Office, the arch is shown towering above the Lincoln Memorial, framing a direct visual line to one of the capital’s most iconic landmarks. Its imposing presence would make it a defining feature of the city’s skyline, cementing its role as a bold new addition to Washington's landscape.Trump framed the idea within a lineage of presidential contributions to the White House, citing James Monroe’s South Portico, Andrew Jackson’s North Portico, Theodore Roosevelt’s West Wing, and Harry Truman’s balcony, suggesting that the arc would join this canon of enduring legacies.This is one of the key unanswered questions. While President Trump presented the Arc de Trump with confidence, many financial and logistical details remain undefined. He indicated that construction could be funded through leftover private donations raised for the White House ballroom, a project already described as “fully financed.” Among these contributions is $22 million from a settlement with YouTube, following the platform’s suspension of Trump’s account after the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.At the East Room dinner, Trump acknowledged the generosity of donors, noting with a smile that some asked if $25 million would be appropriate. “I said, ‘I’ll take it,’” he said. Beyond these pledges, there is no publicly available estimate for the total cost of the arch, nor clarity on the time required for construction, the permitting process, or potential engineering challenges for a structure of this scale.Though the Arc de Trump remains a proposal, it reflects a pattern that has defined much of President Trump’s second term: using architecture to assert legacy, presence, and personal taste. At the East Room dinner, he described the project as “very relaxing” for someone with his background in real estate, suggesting that it’s a natural extension of his long-standing interest in making bold, visible statements that leave a lasting mark on the city.His tenure has already introduced a series of highly visible transformations to the White House and its grounds:The proposed arch is more than a monument to a historic milestone. It is a highly personal expression of Trump’s long-standing desire to leave a physical and cultural mark on the nation’s capital—one that aligns with how he sees his place in history. He told the room, “It’s going to be really beautiful—for me, and for America.” When NPR journalists later asked who the arch was being built for, he reportedly replied simply, “Me. ”The design, shared by Harrison Design principal Nicolas Leo Charbonneau, has been praised for its grandeur and ceremonial weight, fitting for the nation’s 250th anniversary.As of now, the Arc de Trump exists only on paper, in 3D models and renderings. There is no construction schedule, no confirmed funding, and no indication that it has received planning or preservation approvals in Washington, D.C. While Trump suggested that surplus funds from the White House ballroom campaign could contribute, there are no verified cost estimates or timelines.The announcement, theatrical as it was, offered vision but little practical detail. Key questions remain: How long would construction take? What is the full cost? Which permits and approvals are required? The White House has not provided clarity on any of these points.Yet even in this provisional state, the arch communicates intent. Its design evokes the grandeur of Roman triumphal arches and Napoleon’s Arc de Triomphe, a conscious nod to a lineage of leaders who have used monumental architecture to cement their presence in history.In that sense, the Arc de Trump is less a question of if or when and more a reflection of how leaders choose to be remembered. From the Taj Mahal to the Great Wall, from the Pyramids of Giza to Paris’s Arc de Triomphe, history is filled with monuments that outlast their creators. Whether the Arc de Trump will join that lineage—or remain a vision—is yet to be seen.","President Trump announced plans for the Arc de Trump on October 15, 2025.

Daylight Saving Time: Why New Yorkers will not get to see a 6 PM sunset any time soon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/daylight-saving-time-why-new-yorkers-will-not-get-to-see-a-6-pm-sunset-any-time-soon/articleshow/124627244.cms,"Why sunsets are getting earlier and what daylight saving time means

Here’s how it works in practice:

Spring forward:

Fall back:

When will the sun be back after 6 PM





New Yorkers, brace yourselves—your post-work sunlight hours are about to get much shorter. The city will witness its last sunset after 6 PM in 2025 on Saturday, October 25. From the following day, the sun will dip below the horizon before 6 PM, marking the start of darker evenings that will persist until spring next year. By Sunday, November 2, the sun will set at 4:50 PM, a full hour earlier overnight, thanks to the end of Daylight Saving Time (DST). This seasonal shift affects daily life in the city, from commuting patterns to outdoor activities, and can also influence mood as daylight hours diminish.Daylight Saving Time (DST) is the system of moving clocks forward by one hour in the spring and back by one hour in the autumn. Introduced over a century ago during World War I as a fuel-saving measure, it was later standardised across the United States under the Uniform Time Act of 1966. The goal is to make better use of daylight during the evenings, giving people longer hours for work, shopping, recreation, and other activities. While DST aims to save energy, research shows the benefits are limited, and the clock changes can disrupt sleep and affect daily routines.In spring, clocks are moved one hour ahead. For example, if the sun would normally rise at 6 AM and set at 6 PM, the clock now shows 7 AM sunrise and 7 PM sunset.The daylight hasn’t changed—the sun is in the same position—but our daily schedule shifts so evenings feel brighter.In autumn, clocks are moved one hour back. Using the same example, sunrise is now at 5 AM and sunset at 5 PM by the clock. Daylight in the evening ends sooner according to the clock, even though the sun continues its normal path. This is why, after DST ends in November, New Yorkers notice much earlier sunsets.From late October onward, residents gradually lose a few minutes of daylight each day. By the winter solstice on December 21, the shortest day of the year, the city will see only 9 hours and 15 minutes of daylight, with the sun setting at 4:31 PM. The combination of earlier nights and colder weather contributes to the familiar sensation of shorter, darker days. For some, it can also affect mood and energy levels, a phenomenon commonly referred to as seasonal affective disorder.The gradual increase in daylight begins after the winter solstice. However, New Yorkers will not experience another sunset after 6 PM until March 9, 2026, the first day of Daylight Saving Time next year. Until then, evenings will remain short, making it important to enjoy natural light whenever possible. Planning outdoor activities during daylight hours, taking walks in the afternoon sun, and maintaining regular routines can help offset the effects of early nightfall.","New Yorkers will witness its last sunset after 6 PM in 2025 on Saturday, October 25.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

With the recent initiatives to promote digital submissions, pensioners can conveniently fulfil this requirement and maintain their financial support.The requirement for pensioners to submit their jeevan pramaan patra is a critical process in ensuring the integrity and sustainability of pension funds. By providing multiple submission methods—both online and offline—the government is making it easier for pensioners to comply with this requirement. The ongoing digital campaigns further illustrate the government’s commitment to enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of pension services, ensuring that pensioners receive their benefits without unnecessary delays.The submission window for life certificates opened on November 1 for pensioners under the age of 80. This is part of an annual cycle during which pensioners must reaffirm their eligibility for pension disbursement. The deadline for submitting the life certificate is November 30. If the certificate is not submitted by this deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting in December. This requirement also applies to super senior citizens (aged 80 and above), who were allowed to submit their certificates starting on October 1, with the same November 30 deadline.Pensioners can submit their life certificates through several methods, accommodating various preferences and technological capabilities. Here are the options available:For those choosing to submit their life certificates online through the Jeevan Pramaan Portal, the following steps are involved:For pensioners opting for offline submission, the process is straightforward:If pensioners fail to submit their life certificates by the stipulated deadline, their pension payments will be halted starting the following month. However, payments will resume once the life certificate is submitted, thereby ensuring that pensioners do not permanently lose access to their funds, provided they complete the required process.In an effort to facilitate the submission process, the Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare (DoPPW) has initiated its third nationwide digital life certificate (DLC) campaign. This campaign runs from November 1 to November 30, covering 800 cities and districts. The campaign aims to promote the use of digital platforms for certificate submission, ensuring greater accessibility for pensioners.On the first day of this campaign, over 1.8 lakh pensioners successfully generated their digital life certificates, highlighting the growing adoption of technology among pensioners. This indicates a positive trend towards digitalization and the effective use of biometric authentication methods.A life certificate is an official document that verifies a pensioner's living status, required annually to continue receiving pension benefits.All pensioners, including family pensioners, must submit a life certificate to maintain their pension payments.Pensioners under 80 must submit their life certificate between November 1 and November 30 each year. Super senior citizens (80 and above) can submit theirs starting from October 1, with the same deadline.If the life certificate is not submitted by the deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting the following month.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online via the Jeevan Pramaan portal, through doorstep banking agents, using biometric devices at post offices, or in person at bank branches.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online by using the Jeevan Pramaan portal and completing biometric verification through designated apps.Yes, pensioners can submit their life certificates in person at their respective banks or post offices.Generally, you will need your Aadhaar number for biometric verification, along with any other identification or pension-related documents as required by your pension disbursing authority.Pensioners can check the status of their life certificate submission through the Jeevan Pramaan portal or by contacting their bank or pension disbursing authority.Yes, if your submission fails, you can reapply and submit your life certificate again using the same methods available to you.",Submission window for 'Jeevan Pramaan Patra' opens for pensioners under 80 with a deadline of November 30. Pensioners can opt to have a bank agent visit them at home to facilitate the submission of their life certificate. This method is particularly beneficial for those with mobility issues.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114942014,imgsize-53514,width-400,resizemode-4/114942014.jpg"
"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.
