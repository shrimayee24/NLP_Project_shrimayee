"God told Cardi B to date Stefon Diggs, and she didn’t hesitate to follow the sign",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/god-told-cardi-b-to-date-stefon-diggs-and-she-didnt-hesitate-to-follow-the-sign/articleshow/121635313.cms,"Cardi B says God told her to give Stefon Diggs a chance (Getty Images)

Was it fate? Cardi B claims God pushed her toward NFL star Stefon Diggs



Rapper Cardi B reveals she dated Stefon Diggs because God told her to (Instagram0





In an age where relationships are often broadcast like highlight reels and Instagram captions double as love letters, Cardi B has taken an entirely different route. Her recent voice note on X (formerly Twitter) wasn’t just another celebrity confession—it was raw, spiritual, and deeply human. With the honesty of a diary entry and the impact of a sermon, Cardi peeled back the layers of her evolving relationship, one that fans believe involves Buffalo Bills wide receiver Stefon Diggs.And this isn’t your typical Hollywood love story. According to Cardi, this connection wasn’t sparked by slick DMs or flashy meet-cutes. It was orchestrated by something—or someone—much bigger.“I’m with the person that I am with now because sometimes, I don’t know, like, I just feel like God would tell me to give him a chance,” she admitted, with a vulnerability rarely seen from the Bronx-born rapper. “Which is so weird.”In just those few words, Cardi transformed her story into something far deeper than tabloid fodder. After enduring emotional ups and downs, particularly surrounding her long-standing and often-public rollercoaster with Offset, she found herself in a quiet space where someone showed up—not for fame, not for clout, but for her.She detailed those silent struggles: moments of depression, nights of uncertainty, and mental spirals that felt endless.But right then, when she needed it most, came an unexpected yet consistent presence.“When I had those weird episodes, that’s when a n***a would like hit me up or text me out of the mood, checking on me and stuff like that.”There were no fireworks. Just genuine check-ins. In a world that’s loud, his care was quiet—and that, Cardi seems to suggest, was what made all the difference.Before fans connected the dots, long before Instagram posts and matching vibes made it official, she was doing something she hadn’t done in a while: building slowly. This wasn’t about replacing one headline with another. It was about rediscovering trust.“I built a friendship,” she shared. “I got to know the person. They get to know me. We still getting to know each other.”For someone whose life has often played out on stages and timelines, this grounded, spiritually-guided journey feels refreshingly different. It’s not about perfection—it’s about presence. And Diggs, now a wide receiver for the New England Patriots, seemed to understand that perfectly.Cardi and Diggs finally went Instagram official last weekend, ending weeks of speculation. Her heartfelt livestream, shared by Live Bitez, showed a softer side fans adored. Many rushed to the comments with love. “Cardi u dont owe us no explanation!” one user wrote. “Even if it don’t end in marriage, at least you had fun!”This new chapter hasn’t been without noise, though. Offset, her ex and father of her children, took a subtle jab by tweeting, “Good roll out n PR. Today I pass.” Diggs countered with an icy flex—posting a photo of himself mid-catch with the caption, “We good...”Still, the noise seems irrelevant to Cardi. Because for her, this wasn’t about performance. It was about peace, presence, and perhaps, divine timing. If anything, her story reminds us all—sometimes, healing arrives not with fireworks, but with a quiet text at the right time.Also Read: Why Derek Carr left $30 million behind: the real story behind his Saints exit and retirement","Cardi B says she dated NFL star Stefon Diggs because God told her to.

World Environment Day 2025: 7 ways to reduce your carbon footprint when buying beauty products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/beauty/world-environment-day-7-ways-to-reduce-your-carbon-footprint-when-buying-beauty-products/articleshow/121635970.cms,"The beauty industry's environmental impact is significant, but consumers can make planet-friendly choices. Opt for products with natural ingredients and certifications, support local brands to reduce transportation emissions, and minimize single-use packaging by choosing refillable or package-free options. Embrace multi-tasking and waterless products, research brand ethics, and practice mindful consumption to promote a more sustainable beauty routine.

Buy local, support small



Say no to single-use packaging

Go waterless where you can



Check the brand’s sustainability ethics

Beauty that’s more than skin deep



Beauty may be skin deep, but its impact on the planet goes far beyond that. From plastic-heavy packaging to harmful production processes and long transportation chains, the beauty industry leaves a sizeable carbon footprint. As conscious consumers, we have the power to shift the narrative and make planet-friendly choices without compromising on our skincare or glam routines.On this World Environment Day, here’s how you can reduce your carbon footprint while shopping for beauty products:The journey to sustainable beauty begins with mindful ingredient choices. Harsh chemicals like parabens, phthalates, sulphates, and microbeads aren’t just harmful to your skin in the long run, they also damage ecosystems when they wash down the drain. Instead, opt for products with naturally derived, biodegradable ingredients that won’t pollute waterways.Look for third-party certifications. These aren't just buzzwords, they indicate that the product has met certain environmental standards in both formulation and production.When it comes to reducing your carbon footprint, the shorter the supply chain, the better. International beauty products may be tempting, but they often rack up air miles that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.Consider supporting local or regional brands that source and manufacture within your country. These often use locally available botanicals, reducing the energy needed for transportation.Bonus: buying local supports artisans, small businesses, and often results in fresher formulations.If your beauty routine includes dozens of plastic tubes, jars, and droppers, it’s time for a rethink. The beauty industry produces over 120 billion units of packaging every year, most of which ends up in landfills or oceans.To reduce your impact:Opt for refillable products whenever possible (think lipsticks, deodorants, perfumes).Choose brands that use glass, aluminium, or PCR (post-consumer recycled) plastic.Go package-free with solid shampoos, conditioners, and soaps.Support companies offering recycling return schemes.Do you really need a separate cream for your neck, face, and eyes? Often, the answer is no. Multi-use products reduce packaging waste, manufacturing resources, and shipping energy.Look for:Lip & cheek tintsBB creams with SPFAll-in-one serums (hydration + antioxidant + brightening)Cleansers that double as makeup removersNot only will your bathroom shelf thank you, but your travel bag will too.Water is a precious resource, and yet many skincare and haircare products are made up of up to 90% water. The extraction, treatment, and transportation of water adds to environmental strain. Waterless beauty is an emerging trend that helps mitigate this.Try products like:Powder-to-foam cleansersSolid shampoos and conditionersOil-based serums and moisturisersSheet mask alternatives like reusable cloth masksBy choosing waterless formats, you also get longer shelf lives and concentrated formulas that require less packaging.A brand’s marketing might be green, but what about their backend practices? Look beyond the product itself and research:Is the brand carbon-neutral or carbon-negative?Do they use renewable energy in production?Are their workers paid fair wages?Do they offset emissions through tree planting or verified carbon credits?Many ethical brands are transparent about their sustainability reports and list them on their websites. Supporting them means contributing to a cleaner, more equitable planet.It’s tempting to hoard makeup or jump on every new skincare trend, but overconsumption is one of the biggest environmental culprits. Instead of a “more is more” approach, shift your mindset to “quality over quantity.”Wait till you finish a product before buying another.Use the correct quantity to make your products last longer.Share products with a sibling or roommate to reduce wastage.Donate unopened, unused items to verified beauty banks.Minimalism isn’t just aesthetic, it’s sustainable.As beauty consumers, we don’t need to overhaul our entire routine overnight. But small, consistent changes can compound into a major impact. Choosing a refillable lipstick, supporting a local brand, or switching to solid shampoo are all steps that reduce emissions, conserve resources, and push the industry toward greener practices.","The beauty industry leaves a sizeable carbon footprint.

Every year, millions of Muslims from across the globe journey to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to perform Hajj — one of the five pillars of Islam and the most significant spiritual undertaking in a Muslim’s life. This year, the Hajj pilgrimage is not only a religious journey of devotion and reflection but also a remarkable feat of digital transformation and technological innovation. For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced a host of cutting-edge upgrades to ensure pilgrims can perform their rituals with ease, safety, and seamless connectivity. From the provision of free, high-speed internet to the deployment of AI-powered crowd monitoring systems and climate-controlled mosque environments, the Kingdom is leveraging advanced technology to modernize the pilgrimage experience at an unprecedented scale.This effort reflects the Kingdom’s broader Vision 2030 goals, which include transforming Saudi Arabia into a global hub for innovation while preserving its deep-rooted religious and cultural heritage. According to the Gulf News report, with over 10,500 WiFi hotspots, full 4G and 5G coverage, AI-driven safety systems, and even the world’s largest mosque cooling infrastructure, Hajj 2025 may be the most technologically advanced pilgrimage in Islamic history.One of the most talked-about innovations this year is the provision of free, high-speed internet access for all Hajj pilgrims. Saudi Arabia has installed more than 10,500 WiFi access points throughout the pilgrimage zones, including Mecca, Medina, Mina, Arafat, and Muzdalifah. This vast network eliminates the need for pilgrims to seek connectivity during their rituals or logistical movements.According to Saad Al Shanbari, spokesperson for the Hajj Communications and Technology System, the initiative aims to enhance both the spiritual and logistical journey of the pilgrims, as per the Gulf News report. “There’s no need to search for WiFi,” he stated. “Internet access is now available for all pilgrims, everywhere.”This connectivity not only allows pilgrims to stay in touch with family back home and access religious resources but also provides real-time updates, maps, and official communications directly from Hajj authorities.In tandem with the WiFi rollout, the Communications, Space and Technology Commission (CST) has achieved 100% 4G and 5G network coverage across all major Hajj sites. This includes high-density areas such as:This move ensures high bandwidth and low latency for millions of simultaneous users, accommodating massive data transfers, real-time video calls, and even live religious broadcasts to families and followers around the world.Saudi authorities report that over 4,000 telecom engineers and technical staff have been deployed to maintain and optimize service during peak Hajj days.Crowd management during Hajj is critical, given that millions of pilgrims converge in confined spaces, especially during peak rituals like the Day of Arafat or the symbolic stoning at Jamarat. For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced an AI-powered crowd control and safety monitoring system developed in collaboration with Aramco Digital.This system integrates:The AI monitors crowd flow in real time, identifies bottlenecks or high-density zones, and alerts authorities instantly to deploy crowd control personnel or reroute groups to avoid stampedes or accidents.Al Shanbari emphasized the real-time responsiveness of the system, saying, “We’ve deployed smart surveillance systems to manage crowd flows through AI-based monitoring and secure communications. The safety of pilgrims is our highest priority.”Another groundbreaking innovation is the world’s largest cooling system installed at the Grand Mosque in Mecca. As Hajj 2025 coincides with the peak of summer in Saudi Arabia, temperatures are expected to soar above 45°C (113°F). To combat this, the Kingdom has enhanced its centralized air conditioning infrastructure, using underground pipelines to pump chilled air across prayer halls and corridors.The cooling system comprises:This is a critical move for public health and comfort, especially for elderly and physically vulnerable pilgrims. Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah confirmed that this upgrade has already helped prevent numerous cases of heatstroke and dehydration during the initial phases of Hajj 2025.As part of the smart Hajj initiative, Saudi Arabia has also digitized its emergency response operations. Hospitals and medical tents near pilgrimage sites are now AI-integrated and GPS-synced, enabling faster triaging, emergency routing, and real-time coordination between ambulances and medical teams.An example of the system’s success emerged recently when an Egyptian pilgrim survived a heart attack and received immediate treatment thanks to the system's real-time alert and GPS tracking. He is now recovering and is expected to resume his pilgrimage after medical clearance.To tie everything together, Saudi Arabia has launched the Hajj Smart App, an all-in-one platform offering:This app is GPS-enabled and linked to the broader smart infrastructure, allowing pilgrims to navigate easily, even in dense crowds or unfamiliar areas.","For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced a host of cutting-edge upgrades to ensure pilgrims can perform their rituals with ease, safety, and seamless connectivity. From the provision of free, high-speed internet to the deployment of AI-powered crowd monitoring systems and climate-controlled mosque environments, the Kingdom is leveraging advanced technology to modernize the pilgrimage experience at an unprecedented scale.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121619641,imgsize-128544,width-400,resizemode-4/121619641.jpg"

The 2025 Formula 1 Monaco Grand Prix weekend was a dazzling blend of racing, music, art, and luxury.

Celebrities and elite guests including Jeff Bezos, Lauren Sanchez, Dua Lipa, Sofia Vergara, and Odell Beckham Jr. turned Monaco into the ultimate playground of glitz and glamour. From lavish yacht parties to exclusive art events, Monaco gave fans an extraordinary peek into the high life beyond the track.One of the weekend’s most talked-about activities was the debut of the RD Grand Prix, a three-day superyacht experience at Port Hercule. Hosting around a hundred VIPs, the 180-foot yacht combined live music, fine dining, and trackside viewing of the race.

Biscotti says the goal is to “redefine luxury and experiential hospitality” by crafting unforgettable moments that blend entertainment and exclusivity.Just a short walk from the RD Grand Prix, NFL star Odell Beckham Jr. hosted his FRI&NDS activation aboard his private yacht. This event combined music, art, and philanthropy in an intimate, lively atmosphere. Guests like Devin Booker and Chanel Iman mingled as DJ HoneyLuv and Paperwater provided live music, while a curated art exhibit by Lisbon’s Underdogs Gallery showcased works by street artist Alexandre Farto (aka “Vhils”).The highlight was a collaborative concrete carving auctioned off by Beckham and Vhils, with proceeds benefiting Iminente’s Bairros project. This initiative empowers underserved Portuguese communities through art and education. Launched at the Super Bowl earlier this year, FRI&NDS aims to celebrate and support creative talent through cultural events tied to major sports and entertainment moments.Formula 1 driver Charles Leclerc also made a splash during the weekend, debuting a new capsule clothing line with Ferrari Style at Nikki Beach Monte Carlo. The rooftop venue offered stunning views of both the Mediterranean and the race’s famous Fairmont Hairpin. Leclerc mingled with fans as Ferrari’s signature red branding adorned the club in celebration of Nikki Beach’s 10th anniversary.This collaboration added a fashionable edge to the Grand Prix festivities and highlighted how Monaco continues to blend sport with luxury lifestyle in unique ways.The Monaco Grand Prix has always been synonymous with luxury and exclusivity, but this year’s events took it to new heights.

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

iOS 26 expected updates

Apple will kick off its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday, June 9 at 1 PM ET (10:30pm IST), where it is expected to unveil its biggest operating system redesign since iOS 7, along with sweeping UI changes and updated names across its operating system platforms. According to rumours, the company may change the name system of operating systems. Instead of version number, operating systems will now be named by year. It means the update after the current iOS 18 will be iOS 26 rather than, say, iOS 19. Similar naming system may be introduced for other OS platforms as well.While artificial intelligence is expected to play a smaller role compared to recent tech industry trends, Apple is aiming to deliver long-requested improvements such as better window management for iPads and deeper personalization features. According to a 9to5Mac report, the company is working on practical updates to everyday apps such as Messages, Music, Notes, and CarPlay, offering a mix of AI-powered tools and design upgrades.Among the standout additions expected on the Messages app in iOS 26 is automatic message translation, powered by Apple Intelligence. This feature will allow real-time translation of incoming and outgoing texts, improving communication across different languages—similar to features already seen in apps like Google Meet.In Apple Music, the Lock Screen Now Playing view is rumoured to get an upgrade. The full-screen album art may feature an animated artwork, making for a more immersive experience directly on the Lock Screen—a small but polished touch that builds on recent UI improvements.As per the report, Apple Notes will also gain the ability to export notes in Markdown, a long-awaited feature for users who frequently move between Apple’s native app and third-party platforms.The 9to5Mac report states that the design refresh coming with iOS 26 will extend to CarPlay, bringing it in line with the broader Apple ecosystem’s updated visual language. Although the full scope of changes is unclear, it says that both regular and “Ultra” versions of CarPlay will receive visual updates.","Apple will kick off its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday, June 9 at 1 PM ET (10:30pm IST) The company is expected to unveil its biggest operating system redesign since iOS 7, along with sweeping UI changes and updated names.

Florida’s vibrant energy seems to have ignited a new chapter for Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce , who were recently seen sharing a warm moment during a dinner date in Palm Beach. The couple, who have been steadily capturing public attention since their relationship became official, exuded charm and happiness as they left Buccan restaurant hand-in-hand on a balmy Wednesday evening.A fan-captured video posted on social media showed the pair making their way to a waiting SUV, their ease and connection evident as they smiled and waved at onlookers. Swift embraced a chic, understated look, wearing a sleek black spaghetti-strap minidress paired with strappy heels, her hair pulled back into an elegant bun complemented by her signature bold red lipstick. Kelce matched the vibe effortlessly in a black button-down shirt paired with black-and-white checkered pants and loafers, blending street style with a touch of sophistication.Inside the upscale eatery, the couple appeared relaxed and joyful, engaging in lively conversation as they browsed the menu. Kelce’s laughter filled the space, reflecting a lightheartedness that many fans find endearing about their relationship. This dinner date wasn’t just a romantic escape—it also came on the heels of a monumental moment for Swift, who recently reclaimed ownership of the masters to her first six albums.“I’ve been bursting into tears of joy at random intervals ever since I found that this is really happening. I really get to say those words,” Swift shared on her website, her excitement palpable. “All of the music I’ve ever made … now belongs… to me.” This victory, after years of public battles over her catalog, represents a powerful moment of artistic control and personal triumph.Kelce, ever supportive, publicly celebrated Swift’s achievement, not only liking her announcement on social media but also praising her on his podcast. “Shout out to Tay Tay,” he said warmly. “Just bought all of her music back so it’s finally hers.” Their mutual support has only deepened the bond that fans have been watching unfold since Swift’s surprise attendance at a Chiefs game in September 2023 and Kelce’s confirmation of their relationship the following month.The couple’s appearances have become more frequent and public in recent months, including a memorable Mother’s Day outing with Kelce’s mom in Philadelphia and another cozy dinner at Harry’s in West Palm Beach. Their choice to spend time in Florida aligns with Kelce’s recent acquisition of a $20 million mansion in Boca Raton, signaling that this sunny state might become a special retreat for the duo.With Taylor Swift’s career soaring to new heights and Travis Kelce preparing for the upcoming NFL season, their partnership embodies a blend of personal and professional success. Together, they’ve created a narrative that resonates across music and sports fans alike—an inspiring tale of love, resilience, and shared celebration under the Florida sun.Also Read: God told Cardi B to date Stefon Diggs, and she didn’t hesitate to follow the sign","Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce were photographed on a romantic dinner date in Florida.

World Environment Day 2025: How to go zero waste in fashion without losing style,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/fashion/style-guide/world-environment-day-how-to-go-zero-waste-in-fashion-without-losing-style/articleshow/121637222.cms,"The fashion industry's significant environmental impact calls for a shift towards sustainable practices. Consumers can minimize textile waste by shopping intentionally, embracing second-hand options, and repairing clothes. Supporting eco-conscious brands, adopting mindful laundry habits, and advocating for slow fashion are crucial steps. Ultimately, the goal is to reduce consumption and cherish garments, promoting a greener wardrobe.

Shop with intention, not impulse







Embrace second-hand and vintage



Swap, rent or borrow



Learn the art of repair and upcycling



Support zero-waste and sustainable brands



Be smart with laundry



Declutter mindfully, not wastefully



Advocate for slow fashion



The fashion industry is often romanticised for its glamour, but behind the scenes, it’s one of the most polluting industries in the world. Every year, it produces 92 million tonnes of textile waste, and contributes nearly 10% of global carbon emissions. On World Environment Day , there's no better time to re-evaluate your wardrobe habits and commit to a more sustainable path -without sacrificing style.Going zero waste in fashion doesn’t mean you have to wear burlap sacks or boycott shopping altogether. It simply means minimising textile waste, rethinking consumption, and extending the life of garments.Here’s how you can start your zero-waste fashion journey:The average person buys 60% more clothing now than they did 15 years ago but keeps them for half as long. Fast fashion thrives on our impulse buys, selling trendy pieces that quickly go out of style.To break the cycle:Ask yourself: Do I really need this? Will I wear it at least 30 times?Build a capsule wardrobe - a limited set of versatile, timeless pieces you truly love.Invest in high-quality, well-tailored clothing that lasts longer.Fashion doesn’t have to be fast to be fabulous.Thrift stores, consignment boutiques, and online marketplaces or even Instagram thrift shops are treasure troves for one-of-a-kind pieces.By shopping second-hand, you're saving garments from landfills and reducing the demand for virgin resources.Plus, vintage fashion:Is unique and often better madeLets you create a personal style that’s not dictated by seasonal trendsIs more affordable and planet-friendlyYour best outfit might already exist—just not in your closet yet.Who says you have to own every outfit you wear?Clothing swaps with friends or community groups are a great way to refresh your wardrobe without buying new.Rental platforms are ideal for occasion wear like wedding lehengas or cocktail gowns.Borrow from your friends and family, especially for one-time events.This circular approach keeps clothes in use longer and drastically reduces fashion waste.We’ve become too used to tossing clothes at the first sign of wear. But a missing button or broken zip isn’t the end of the road.Mend small damages instead of discarding garments.Upcycle old outfits, turn a long kurta into a trendy co-ord set, or jeans into a denim bag.Learn basic sewing skills, or support local tailors and artisans who can give your clothes new life.Your “ruined” clothes might just need a little imagination.More fashion labels are adopting zero-waste design, where every scrap of fabric is used. Some brands even use textile waste from other companies to create new garments.Look for labels that:Produce limited, made-to-order collectionsUse deadstock fabrics, organic cotton, or recycled fibresPractice transparent and ethical productionIndian brands like Doodlage, Nicobar, Bhu:Sattva, and No Nasties are great examples of mindful fashion that doesn’t harm the planet.Yes, even the way you care for your clothes has an impact.Wash clothes less frequently and only when needed.Use cold water and gentle detergents to reduce energy usage.Air-dry clothes instead of using a dryer whenever possible.Avoid synthetic fabrics that shed microplastics - opt for natural fibres like cotton, linen, hemp, and Tencel.How you maintain your clothes matters just as much as how you buy them.If you’re doing a wardrobe purge, don’t just throw old clothes in the bin.Donate to verified organisations that pass them to those in need.S ell online via preloved platforms.Repurpose as cleaning rags, cushion stuffing, or pet bedding.Compost 100% natural fibre garments if they’re beyond repair.The goal is to keep clothing out of landfills as long as possible.Fashion trends may come and go, but environmental responsibility is here to stay. Use your voice as a consumer to support policies and brands that champion sustainability.Follow slow fashion influencers for education and inspiration.Share your zero-waste fashion journey on social media.Encourage friends and family to make conscious choices.Write to brands asking for transparency and responsible practices.Every ripple adds up to a wave of change.Going zero waste in fashion isn’t about perfection - it’s about intention. It’s about rethinking the way we interact with our clothes, consuming less, and cherishing more. On World Environment Day, take the first (or next) step towards a greener wardrobe.Because what’s the point of being well-dressed if the planet is distressed?","The fashion industry produces 92 million tonnes of textile waste every year.

Can high tech boost safety?

'Contact us'?

Less religion, more cyber





This year, it's drones featuring thermal imaging and robots handing out religious advice.A decade ago, it was all about the miracle of the mobile phone. And a century or so ago, the motor car was the highest of high-tech used during the annual Hajj pilgrimage.The Hajj, one of the largest gatherings of humans on Earth, is meant to be undertaken by every adult Muslim once in their lifetime. It will begin in Saudi Arabia on June 4 and end June 9. During those days, up to 2 million pilgrims from over 180 countries will take part in a number of different religious ceremonies in Mecca.But having so many people moving around in one comparatively small area has led to problems in the past. Thousands of pilgrims were killed in stampeding crowds in 1990 and 2015. Last year over 1,300 died due to extreme heat; pilgrims often walk up to 65 kilometers a day in 40-to-50 degrees Celsius heat. There have also been fires, protests, suicides, collapsing buildings and infectious diseases at the Hajj, as well as more everyday problems like people getting lost or having health problems.No wonder then that the Saudi authorities are trying to use technology to improve how they control crowds and cater to their visitors.This year, Saudi Arabia will use drones with thermal imaging as well as artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology to ensure that only those who have Hajj permits are allowed in.Last year's many deaths were mostly of pilgrims who didn't have official permission to be there and therefore couldn't access services like air-conditioned shelter in the extreme heat.To avoid overcrowding, Saudi Arabia's Nusuk website, also a mobile phone application, allows attendees to register to enter certain areas at allotted times. The Nusuk system includes an electronic identity card and a smart wristband, which hold information on the user's identity, travel plans, finances, health and accommodation, among other things. The Nusuk card must be carried throughout the pilgrimage and is used to access transport and other services. Some of the wristbands have location tracking, monitor the wearer's blood oxygen levels and heart rate, and can even be used to call for medical help.Other technological advances at this year's Hajj include robots to guide visitors around religious sites and to hand out water, Korans or offer advice in 11 languages. There are also newly paved, more reflective (and therefore cooler) streets, paths that minimize vibration for walking comfort, and a special white pilgrim's gown made from futuristic fabric that keeps the wearer up to 2 degrees Celsius cooler.All the technology, surveillance and advanced algorithmic calculation is meant to make the event safer and the chance of tragic accidents less likely. But as the amount of technology grows, so too do concerns about data privacy, state surveillance and potential cybercrime.""All of these technologies are mandatory and those who refuse them are not allowed to perform the pilgrimage,"" explains Zeinab Ismail, a researcher and editor at the Lebanon-based digital rights organization, SMEX. ""All of this, combined with Saudi Arabia's personal data protection law, which only partially aligns with international standards and contains concerning provisions and loopholes, raises increasing concerns about the safety and privacy of pilgrims' data. ""Saudi officials have argued that privacy concerns must outweigh safety at such a huge event.""Regardless of the [Saudi government's] justification, what worries me the most — and irrespective of the technology itself — is the fact that this technology is being deployed in a country where rule of law is weak, there's no transparency and no [state] accountability,"" argues Marwa Fatafta, policy director for the Middle East and North Africa at international digital rights organization, Access Now.It would be difficult to audit the technologies for problems and even harder for individuals to question their use, Fatafta told DW.""For the people who are going to the Hajj pilgrimage, they're not in any position to push back and say, 'I don't want to give my biometric data',"" she continued. ""So just the general context means that the door is wide open for abuse.""Reading the Nusuk app's terms and conditions, information about how long pilgrims' personal data can be kept is vague and even contradictory. DW e-mailed Saudi Arabia's National Data Management Office and the supervising Saudi Data and AI Authority to ask for more information on this. Both organizations publish e-mail addresses for the public to use if they have questions or want to make a complaint.Two DW e-mails received no response. Another bounced back with the message: ""Recipient's mailbox is full.""Since 2023, Saudi Arabia has had a personal data protection law — but as Ismail pointed out, ""the current legal framework … allows legislation to be interpreted or manipulated in ways that may serve state interests over human rights.""It's not just potential misuse of millions of pilgrims' data by local authorities causing concern. Higher dependence on technology to monitor and control Hajj pilgrims also means more vulnerability in general, as there are more places for hackers to attack. And Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states are already some of the biggest victims of cybercrime.The first platform Saudi Arabia used for registering pilgrims, Motawif, was run by a private company and unexpectedly sent spam to users. The state-run Nusuk app replaced it in 2022. The following year, cybersecurity experts found data submitted to Nusuk for sale on illicit websites that deal in stolen personal data.New technology has also brought another worry: Is all that high tech taking away from the once-in-a-lifetime spiritual relevance of the Hajj?A 2018 study conducted by researchers at the University of Central Lancashire in the UK suggested it might be.Pilgrims interviewed for the study complained about others taking selfies at holy sites, talking on the phone while performing rituals and behaving like tourists rather than pious visitors. ""Smartphones are the fourth devil in Hajj,"" one interviewee said, referring to a ritual featuring three representations of the devil.Some even complained all the technology was making the journey too easy.Where once pilgrims walked between holy sites, now they ride a high-speed train. And where once they stayed in simple tents, now they're accommodated in 10,000 air-conditioned, fire-resistant tents.""Since the Hajj has become 'high-tech,' the fundamental spirituality of the pilgrim's experience is arguably being transformed into something more akin to a 'cyber experience',"" the UK researchers wrote. Traditionally the Hajj is meant to be all about simplicity, spiritual purity and contemplative worship, they explained.As with every other kind of digital technology, high tech at the Hajj had its benefits and disadvantages, they concluded.","Saudi Arabia will use drones with thermal imaging and facial recognition to control Hajj crowds. Pilgrims will also wear smart wristbands that monitor their health and can call for help. But as the amount of technology grows, so too do concerns about data privacy and cybercrime.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121620942,imgsize-887447,width-400,resizemode-4/121620942.jpg"

These include:Even in such cases, employers are still obligated to implement all possible safety measures to protect workers.MoHRE has deployed advanced inspection systems to track compliance, and encourages the public to report violations through:Penalties for violations are:The Midday Break is a component of the broader ‘We the UAE 2031’ strategy, which promotes sustainable, human-centered work environments across sectors.

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Weeks after one of its professors, Ali Khan Mahmudabad, was arrested over a social media post he wrote on Operation Sindoor and the university was criticised for not taking a stand amid a raging argument over free speech, Ashoka trustee and co-founder Sanjeev Bikhchandani made his views clear in an emailed reply to a former student. Activism is not embedded to a liberal arts university, a political post on social media is not academic scholarship, and the founders have considered walking away, he asserted in the email.""Why don't you and other alumni offer to step in and take over?"" Bikhchandani wrote in the email that was shared on an internal mailing list. ""Pramath, Ashish and I have seriously discussed the option of walking away. Ashoka is too much of a headache... money, even in this day and age, does not grow on trees but it still makes the world go around,"" he added, referring to fellow trustee Pramath Raj Sinha and founding chairperson Ashish Dhawan.Dwelling at length on activism, he wrote, ""Activism and a Liberal Arts University are not joined at the hip. Ashoka is a Liberal Arts and Sciences University. Whether to be activists or not is a conscious choice people make.In the past I have questioned the activism at Ashoka — each time, I have been pounced upon by the activists and their supporters, both within and outside Ashoka: students, faculty, activists, etc.,saying that ‘if you are running a liberal arts university, then activism goes with the territory', that ‘I am an arrogant owner', that ‘dirty filthy capitalists don't understand how a university runs' (they somehow forget that the same capitalists are paying their salaries). """"You can be a great liberal arts university and not be activist. Anyone who tells you otherwise is a liar,"" he added. ""As an institution, Ashoka cannot take an activist position. It (Ashoka) is governed by the law of the land… It is answerable to regulators and to government authorities. It is not a political party or movement — it is an educational institution.""Addressing the row over Mahmudabad's post and his arrest without taking names, Bikhchandani wrote, ""A political opinion expressed on Facebook or Twitter (X) or Instagram is not academic scholarship. Consequently, any public outcry about a political opinion an academic may express on social media is not an attack on academic freedom... If a regulator or the government or law enforcement goes after you for a social media post, it is not an infringement of academic freedom. It might be an infringement of freedom of speech; however, there are provisions within the Constitution and the law where you can find protection. You are a grown-up adult. You are responsible for your actions and any consequences thereof. Ashoka is not obliged to support you for political opinions... You did not seek Ashoka's consent before posting on social media, you cannot now present Ashoka with a fait accompli and expect support.""""Appropriate timing of what to say, where, when and to whom and how is a sign of intelligence (beyond academic scholarship),"" he added. ""If you end up offending a whole bunch of people, even though you were not technically incorrect in what you said, then an expression of regret and an apology is a sign of good grace and decency. Hijacking an institutional platform to make it subordinate to your political agenda is an act of institutional capture and selfishness. Expecting the institution to then support you is an act of entitlement and arrogance.""In making these points, Bikhchandani identified a ""policy issue"" for Ashoka's governing body to think over. ""Can a full-time academic also pursue a political career? In the private sector, we generally stay away from what are termed as ‘politically exposed persons'. Should Ashoka have such a policy?""Mahmudabad, incidentally, has been associated with Samajwadi Party, though he has been inactive in recent years.","Ashoka trustee and co-founder Sanjeev Bikhchandani made his views clear in an emailed reply to a former student.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Major adult websites Pornhub , YouPorn , and RedTube , owned by Aylo , have reportedly blocked access to their content in France in protest of new age verification requirements aimed at protecting minors from accessing pornography. French visitors attempting to access these platforms on Wednesday were greeted with a message denouncing the privacy risks posed by the government’s mandate, which requires users to verify their age using sensitive personal information such as credit cards or ID documents.According to a report by news agency AFP, the message on Pornhub, accompanied by an image of the bare-breasted Liberty from Eugène Delacroix’s 1830 painting Liberty Leading the People, criticized the French law: “Your government suggests checking your age every time you visit our site — that’s crazy, right?” Aylo, formerly MindGeek, argued that the requirement to repeatedly provide personal data creates an “unacceptable security risk” for users, citing potential vulnerabilities to hacks, leaks, or bad actors. The company also claimed that the law pushes users toward unregulated sites that fail to moderate content for issues like performer age and consent.France’s new rules, part of a broader global trend, align with the EU’s Digital Services Act, the UK’s Online Safety Act, and similar laws in several U.S. states, all designed to restrict minors’ access to inappropriate online content. The European Commission recently launched an investigation into Pornhub, Stripchat, XNXX, and XVideos for alleged failures to protect minors. France, which was Pornhub’s second-largest market in 2024, requires adult platforms to offer a “double-blind” third-party verification option to shield user data from the sites themselves, but Aylo dismissed this as ineffective.Instead, Aylo proposed that governments mandate age verification at the device level through operating systems like Apple, Microsoft, or Google, which could provide an “age signal” to grant or deny access without compromising user privacy.The report quoted France’s Digital Affairs Minister Clara Chappaz who responded firmly. He said, “Let [Pornhub, YouPorn, and RedTube] go. They can come back the day they’re ready to finally respect our rules.”","Pornhub, YouPorn, and RedTube blocked in France in protest of new age verification requirements.

“If we can bring more to Europe of what we have developed in the United States, that will strengthen cybersecurity protection for more European institutions. You're going to see other things we are doing later in the month.”

“We don't feel that we have seen AI that has evaded our ability to detect the use of AI or the threats more broadly. Our goal needs to be to keep AI advancing as a defensive tool faster than it advances as an offensive weapon,”

Microsoft is offering a free cybersecurity program to European governments to enhance their defences against cyber threats. The program, which was launched recently, includes safety against cyberattacks that are amplified by artificial intelligence (AI). This initiative comes after a recent increase in cyberattacks across Europe, many of which have been linked to state-sponsored actors from countries such as China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. The program's objective is to boost intelligence-sharing specifically concerning AI-based threats. It also aims to help these countries with the prevention and disruption of these attacks. In an interview with the news agency Reuters, Microsoft President Brad Smith revealed how the company is planning to offer its services to these European governments to safeguard against cyberattacks.In the Reuters interview, Smith said:He noted that attackers are increasingly using generative AI to expand the scale and impact of their operations, from disrupting critical infrastructure to spreading disinformation. However, Smith added that while AI has been weaponised by malicious actors, it also offers valuable defensive capabilities.he highlighted.Smith continued, saying audio has, so far, been easier to fake than video. He also confirmed that Microsoft monitors the use of its AI models for any malicious activity and restricts access to known cybercriminals.Notable examples of AI-driven deepfakes include a 2022 video falsely showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy surrendering to Russia, and a fake audio clip in 2023 that influenced the Slovakian election.","Microsoft is offering a free cybersecurity program to European governments to enhance their defences against cyber threats.

Ganion further added that the move is part of a regular review of the platform’s safety measures to address emerging risks.What happens when a user searches #skinnytok on TikTokIf a user searches for #skinnytok on TikTok, they are now redirected to mental health support resources.The now-banned hashtag has garnered over half a million posts. Many of these posts reportedly glamorised extreme thinness and shared guilt-inducing messages like “you aren’t ugly, you are just fat”.France’s Digital Minister Clara Chappaz welcomed the move, calling it a “collective victory” after nearly two months of campaigning, which included a public petition and a meeting with TikTok executives in Dublin in early May. “The fight to protect our children online doesn't stop there,” Chappaz said. “I won't give up. Banning social media before 15 is my priority.”The ban has amplified calls in Brussels for stricter rules on social media use by children. EU politicians have seized on the #SkinnyTok issue to support ongoing discussions around new regulations under the Digital Services Act (DSA), which aims to strengthen content moderation across major platforms.The topic was also raised during a recent call between EU Consumer Protection Commissioner Michael McGrath and TikTok CEO Shou Chew. “This is a live investigation which will take its course in the normal way, but I felt it was important to reiterate the Commission’s strong stance on child protection,” McGrath said.",TikTok has blocked search results for the #SkinnyTok hashtag globally.
