MUMBAI: Fifty years ago, on May 18,1974, when Pranab Dastidar , former BARC director, pressed the button and detonated a nuclear device at 8.05am at Pokhran in Rajasthan, it was dubbed as a peaceful nuclear explosion ( PNE ).But, in its golden jubilee year, it remains unanswered whether this historic test, code named “Smiling Buddha’’ -- which took the world by surprise and shock -- was a PNE or a cover for an atomic bomb test.Then PM Indira Gandhi green lighted the project during a visit to BARC on September 7, 1972, and formally gave the thumbs up for the test on May 17, 1974, when she said: “Dr Ramanna, please go ahead. It will be good for the nation.’’R Chidambaram, former Indian nuke head, remembered that he carried the plutonium device with his colleague, PR Roy all the way from Mumbai to Pokhran in a military truck sleeping in the vehicle, next to the box containing the device.While the official position remains that it is a PNE, none other than the leader of the nuclear mission, Raja Ramanna, described as the father of the Indian nuclear weapons programme, strongly disagrees.In a 1997 interview to a news agency, Ramanna – who passed away in 2004 -- did not mince words when he said: “It was a bomb. I can tell you now … an explosion is an explosion, a gun is a gun whether you shoot at someone or shoot at the ground. I just want to make it clear that the test was not all that peaceful.’’Ramanna acknowledged that the PNE was a cover for a programme aimed from the beginning to develop a nuclear weapons capability.According to former nuke officials requesting anonymity, the PNE cover had to be used because the plutonium for the test was from the Cirus reactor at BARC in Trombay, Mumbai, which was supplied by Canada and the heavy water was from the US.The understanding was that the plutonium would only be used for peaceful purposes. So, when the US and Canada heard about the test, they voiced their opposition.In an earlier interview with, Dastidar, the man who pushed the Pokhran trigger, recalled that on the day he retired from BARC, his colleagues presented him with a model of the Cirus reactor, the nuclear device and also a mushroom cloud. The mushroom cloud is generally associated with an atomic bomb.Strongly countering this argument, Anil Kakodkar, former Indian nuke chief, who was part of the “Smiling Buddha,’’ project toldrecently: “The test was a PNE having several useful civilian applications.’’“The test created a sense of confidence but also posed challenges as we had to beat the embargoes which followed. However, this made us more self-reliant,’’ he added.","Fifty years ago, Pranab Dastidar detonated a nuclear device at Pokhran in Rajasthan.

Strategic implications

Challenges and future prospects

Broader military strategy

NEW DELHI: China has taken a significant step in naval warfare by launching the world's first dedicated drone aircraft carrier . This strategic move indicates a shift towards more cost-effective unmanned aerial operations , which could redefine power projection in potential conflicts, including with the United States.According to a report in the Asia Times, the unique vessel was constructed at the Jiangsu Dayang Marine shipyard on the Yangtze River.Its design, which is smaller and features a straight deck, is optimized for fixed-wing drone operations. Although the carrier's layout resembles that of World War II escort carriers, it is equipped to handle modern aerial drones rather than manned aircraft.Naval powers worldwide, including Iran and Turkey, have been adapting existing vessels for drone operations. For example, Iran's Shahid Mahdavi drone carrier was converted from a commercial cargo ship, and Turkey repurposed its TCG Anadolu after being excluded from America's F-35 program. China's approach, however, involves a purpose-built vessel, suggesting a significant commitment to integrating drones into its naval strategy.According to Naval News, the drone carrier is not just a technological experiment but a potential game-changer in naval power dynamics. It could operate from shore or serve as a testbed for refining drone operations at sea. With its catamaran hull and low flight deck, the carrier is designed to support large fixed-wing UAVs, crucial for long-range operations and simulating enemy naval units in military exercises.Alexander Gates from the UK Defense Journal highlights that drone carriers like China's offer similar power projection advantages to traditional aircraft carriers but at a fraction of the cost and risk. These carriers enable states to extend their aerial capabilities over greater distances without relying on land bases, making them particularly suitable for surveillance, reconnaissance, and light attack missions in conflict zones.Despite the advancements, Gates notes that drone carriers will not immediately revolutionize military affairs. Their effectiveness is limited in environments with strong air defenses and electronic warfare capabilities. Nonetheless, they represent a significant shift towards more versatile and cost-effective naval assets.In a broader context, China's drone carrier could play a vital role in scenarios like a potential conflict over Taiwan, where drone swarms launched from both land and sea could be used to overwhelm defenses in preparation for more extensive military operations.","China has launched the world's first dedicated drone aircraft carrier.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Scenario 1 – Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction within the same billing cycle Purchase transaction date – October 15, 2023 As bill is yet to be generated in the given case, the refund amount received on October 19, 2023, shall be adjusted with other debits, prior to calculation of the Total Amount Due. Refund on October 19, 2023 - For cancellation of purchase dated October 15, 2023 Scenario 2 – Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction post generation of bill but before making payment of the dues Purchase transaction date - October 29, 2023 The bill is generated on October 30, 2023, however, the payment towards the dues has not been made till the date of refund. Therefore, the refund amount received on November 04, 2023, shall be adjusted towards the Total Amount Due (TAD) and accordingly the cardholder will be required to pay only the remaining outstanding (Remaining outstanding = TAD – Refund amount). Scenario 3 – Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction for which payment has already been made Purchase transaction date - October 30, 2023 As the cardholder has already cleared the dues, card-issuers shall seek explicit consent of the cardholder to adjust the refund amount in line with the provision stipulated at Para 10(h) of the MD. Payment towards dues – November 06, 2023 Case I - If the cardholder gives explicit consent, then refund amount shall be adjusted. Refund on November 07, 2023 - For cancellation of purchase dated October 30, 2023 Case II - If the cardholder does not provide the consent or no response is received for adjustment of the refund, then the refund amount will be credited to the bank account of the cardholder in line with para 10(h). Further, if the cardholder makes a request for crediting the refund (transaction for which payment has already been made), the same shall be credited back to the bank account of the cardholder irrespective of the cut off defined under Para10(h).

Credit cards offer a convenient means to manage finances and enhance financial well-being. By using credit cards responsibly, individuals can build a positive credit history and improve their financial habits. It's important to use credit cards for expenses while ensuring timely repayment of debts to boost credit scores.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently introduced amendments effective from March 7, 2024, alongside releasing updated FAQs regarding credit and debit card issuance.One important question addressed in the FAQs is whether a credit card can be used beyond its sanctioned limit, with over-limit charges imposed, states an ET report. According to RBI guidelines, using a credit card beyond the approved limit (overlimit) necessitates explicit consent from the cardholder. Furthermore, cardholders must have the option to enable or disable the overlimit feature through various platforms provided by the card issuer. Without explicit consent, neither overlimit facilities can be extended nor overlimit charges levied.Here are some key FAQs derived from the Master Direction (MD) - Credit Card and Debit Card – Issuance and Conduct Directions, 2022:Card issuers cannot send credit cards without the customer's permission. If a customer gets an unsolicited card, they should not activate it or agree to its activation. If they don't consent, the issuer must close the credit card account within seven working days at no cost to the customer. The issuer will inform the customer about the closure. After that, the customer should destroy the card. If needed, the customer can complain to the issuer and escalate the issue to the RBI Ombudsman.If a cardholder fails to pay the total amount due by the payment due date, they will lose the interest-free credit period. Interest may be charged from the transaction date on the outstanding amount (adjusted for payments, refunds, or reversed transactions) and not the total due amount. Late payment fees and other charges will only apply to the outstanding amount after the payment due date, not the total amount due.Paragraphs 7(b) and 7(c) of the MD allow the issuance of different types of credit cards that can tap into the limits of various loan accounts. These cards are tailored to match the terms and conditions of the specific loan account. For instance, if a customer has an overdraft facility, they can receive a credit card to access the funds from that facility. The terms of use for this credit card, including interest rates, repayment schedules, penalties, and cash withdrawal limits, will mirror those of the overdraft facility.Additionally, paragraph 7(c) gives card issuers the flexibility to design Business Credit Cards according to their credit card policies. However, it's important to note that banks are not allowed to issue debit cards for cash credit or loan accounts.Which transactions can be used to reduce the amount owed and credited to the cardholder's bank account?In a standard credit card cycle from October 1, 2023, to October 30, 2023, assuming the bill is issued on October 30, 2023, and payment is due by November 19, 2023, here are the possible scenarios for adjusting credit:Activation of a credit card is confirmed through customer-initiated actions such as PIN generation, adjusting transaction controls, Interactive Voice Response, contacting customer care through recorded calls, or SMS communication. If the card remains inactive for more than 30 days from the date of issue, the card issuer must request One Time Password (OTP) based consent, as outlined in paragraph 6(a)(vi) of the MD.For business credit cards applied for by a corporate or business entity, card issuers must obtain explicit consent from the principal account holder, as specified in paragraph 6(a)(vi). Similarly, they must send notifications as per paragraph 8(b). This consent should come from the principal cardholder, unless otherwise stated in the agreement. Likewise, for retail credit cards, consent must be obtained from the principal cardholder, not from any add-on cardholders.Card issuers are not permitted to apply interest or other charges to unpaid taxes, levies, or charges. This provision, outlined in paragraph 9(b)(ii) of the MD, took effect from October 1, 2022. Therefore, card issuers cannot apply such charges to any unpaid taxes, levies, or charges billed from that date onwards.Regarding transactions eligible for adjustment towards outstanding dues and credited to the cardholder's bank account, let's consider a typical credit card billing cycle from October 1, 2023, to October 30, 2023. Assume the bill is generated on October 30, 2023, with a payment due date of November 19, 2023. Here are the different scenarios:- Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction within the same billing cycle:- Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction post-generation of bill but before making payment of the dues:","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently introduced amendments effective from March 7, 2024, alongside releasing updated FAQs regarding credit and debit card issuance.

EPF members can stop automatic EPF account transfers



EPF automatic account transfer : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) offers a convenient solution for its members when changing jobs: automatic transfer of EPF accounts . Despite its usefulness, this facility remains relatively unknown.As per an ET report, the automatic transfer simplifies the process for EPF members switching jobs , enabling them to seamlessly move their PF balances without the need for online or offline transfer requests.The transfer occurs automatically from the old employer to the new one, sparing members the hassle of managing the transfer themselves.Vaibhav Bhardwaj, a Partner at INDUSLAW, said that EPFO's automatic EPF account transfer has been operational since 2017.However, it's important to note that not all EPF members have access to the automatic transfer facility from old to new employers. It's only available for those whose EPF accounts are managed by EPFO. Exempted PF trusts are not included in this automatic transfer option.Gupta explains that if either the previous or current company operates a private provident fund trust, the auto-transfer feature will not function. A private PF trust oversees the provident fund contributions of employees within the respective company, rather than through the EPFO. However, it must still comply with EPFO regulations.Bhardwaj adds that EPF members transferring their old EPF account to a new EPF account, whether from EPF to an exempted trust or vice versa, or between exempted trusts, will need to apply for transfer using Form 13, either online or offline.The EPFO has set specific requirements for automatic EPF account transfers from old to new employers. These conditions, outlined in a November 2017 circular, include:(i) Matching UAN and Aadhaar numbers provided by the new employer with existing details in the UAN.(ii) Aadhaar number of the EPF member must be linked and verified with the UAN at their previous workplace.(iii) Availability of EPF member's details such as date of joining, date of exit, and reason for exit from the old employer.(iv) Activation of EPF member's UAN, with a registered mobile number.Bhardwaj further explains that when an employee starts a new job and receives their first month's provident fund contribution from the new employer, an automatic transfer is activated. This triggers the transfer of the EPF member's previous provident fund dues to their new account.Once the process is triggered, an SMS and email notification inform the member about the initiation of the auto transfer.Sandeep Agrawal, Director and Co-Founder of Teamlease Regtech, said that for automatic transfer claims, there's no requirement to submit Form 13. However, if the automatic transfer doesn't occur within the specified time due to issues like mismatched dates of exit, not updated exit dates by a previous employer, member details mismatch, or pending UAN Aadhaar seeding, members can opt for online Form 13 to transfer EPF and EPS accumulation from the previous employer to the present one.Once an EPF member receives SMS and email notifications regarding the auto transfer of their EPF account, they should verify if the transfer has been successful.Puneet Gupta, Partner at People Advisory Services EY India, mentions that the auto transfer process will only be finalized if the member doesn't request to stop it within 10 days of receiving the notification, either online, through the employer, or at the nearest EPFO office. Additionally, the transfer will be completed after the first contribution from the new employer is deposited and reconciled.The automatic EPF transfer follows a similar process to manual requests. Experts suggest that it may take 2-3 weeks for the automatic transfer to complete.Sandeep Agrawal adds that members can confirm the transfer by checking their passbooks. By logging into the unified portal and navigating to 'View Passbook,' members can see a credit entry if their PF has been successfully transferred.EPF members have the option to halt automatic transfers if they prefer. They can do so within 10 days of receiving the SMS notification about the auto transfer initiation. This can be done online via the Member e-Sewa portal or offline through their current employer or by visiting the nearest EPFO office.Gupta has mentioned the steps for stopping the automatic transfer online:1. Log in to the EPFO Member portal.2. Navigate to the ""Online services"" tab and select ""Track claim status.""3. Choose the option ""Stop auto-initiated claim cases.""If the auto transfer request has been triggered, it will appear under ""Stop auto-initiated claim cases,"" providing the option to halt the transfer. After stopping the EPF transfer, the member will receive communication via SMS to the mobile number linked to the UAN and the registered email address.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) offers a convenient solution for its members when changing jobs: automatic transfer of EPF accounts.

New NPS rule from April 1 : The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has enhanced National Pension System (NPS) security by adding a new layer called two-factor Aadhaar authentication . Starting April 1, all users logging into the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) system with passwords must use this feature, as per the PFRDA circular dated March 15, 2024.According to ET, using two-factor authentication greatly lowers the risk of unauthorised access to the CRA system . This added layer ensures the safety of NPS transactions and protects the interests of subscribers and stakeholders.The login process for NPS CRAs is changing. Following the circular, Aadhaar-based authentication will now be combined with the current user ID and password login system. This update enables access to the NPS central record-keeping agency (CRA) system through two-factor authentication.Here's how to log in to NPS using 2-factor authentication:1. Visit the NPS website: https://enps.nsdl.com/eNPS/NationalPensionSystem.html2. Click on 'Login with PRAIN/IPIN.'3. Select the PRAIN/IPIN tab, and a new window will open.4. Enter your user ID and password.5. Complete the Captcha verification.6. A window will prompt for Aadhaar authentication and send an OTP.7. Enter the OTP received on your registered mobile number.8. Submit the OTP.To bolster security and protect the interests of subscribers and stakeholders, the CRA system will now use Aadhaar-based authentication for login. This authentication method will be integrated with the existing User ID and Password login system, enabling 2-factor authentication to access the CRA system.Government sector nodal offices can employ Aadhaar OTP for 2-factor authentication on the CRA and NPSCAN systems. To begin Aadhaar Mapping, the Oversight Office (PrAO/DTA) must initially link Aadhaar with the respective CRA User ID. PAO/DTOs must also link their Aadhaar with their CRA User ID to enable DDOs to initiate Aadhaar linkage.Government and autonomous bodies are required to implement Aadhaar-based login and authentication within the CRA system for NPS operations.","The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has enhanced National Pension System (NPS) security by adding a new layer.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

‘MatterSim is accurate and efficient’

Microsoft researchers have developed a new deep learning model called MatterSim that can simulate materials across the entire periodic table under realistic conditions. This can accelerate the discovery of new materials for nanoelectronics, energy storage and healthcare.Creating new materials is a challenge as it often requires predicting their properties before they are even synthesised.This is difficult because the properties depend on the combination of elements used, as well as the temperature and pressure during creation and operation.The model can accurately and efficiently simulate materials, and make predictions over their properties when subjected to a broad range of temperatures and pressures to enable the in silico materials design, the researchers say.“MatterSim employs deep learning to understand atomic interactions from the very fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, across a comprehensive spectrum of elements and conditions—from 0 to 5,000 Kelvin (K), and from standard atmospheric pressure to 10,000,000 atmospheres,” the company says.Microsoft claims that MatterSim “efficiently handles simulations for a variety of materials, including metals, oxides, sulphides, halides, and their various states such as crystals, amorphous solids, and liquids.”The model also offers customisation options so that researchers can train the model with specific data for intricate prediction tasks.As per the researchers, MatterSim is trained on a massive dataset generated through a combination of techniques. This allows it to predict material properties like energy, atomic forces, and stress with high accuracy, comparable to traditional methods requiring much more computational power.Last year, Google DeepMind also created a system called A-Lab that can predict the structure of materials, and carry out synthesis as well as analysis without human intervention. The researchers at the company said that the system can predict nearly 400,000 stable substances.","Microsoft researchers have developed a new deep learning model called MatterSim.

At its annual Google I/O 2024 developers conference, the company announced stronger protections against fraud and scams coming to Android 15 .“We’re also bringing additional protections to fight fraud and scams in Android 15 with two key enhancements to safeguard your information and privacy from bad apps,” the company said, adding that it is working on new, AI-powered protections against fraud and scams.With the exception of a few types of apps, such as wearable companion apps, OTPs will be hidden from notifications, closing a common attack vector for fraud and spyware.To help protect sensitive permissions that are commonly abused by fraudsters, the company is expanding restricted settings feature which was launched in Android 13.Those using Android 15 will have to provide additional user approval to enable permissions when installing an app from an Internet-sideloading source, such as web browsers, messaging apps or file managers.The company is also tightening controls for screen sharing in Android 15 to limit social engineering attacks that try to view your screen and steal information.When a user is sharing a screen, private notification content will be hidden, preventing remote viewers from seeing details in a user's notifications.“Apps that post OTPs in notifications will be automatically protected from remote viewers when you’re screen sharing, helping thwart attempts to steal sensitive data,” Google said.Additionally, the screen of the device running on Android 15 will be hidden when users enter credentials like usernames, passwords and credit card numbers during a screen-share session.Currently available on Pixel, and soon rolling out to other Android devices, users will be able to share just one app's content rather than your whole screen to help preserve screen privacy.","Google announces protections against fraud and scams coming to Android 15.

Android 15 beta 2 is now available for Google Pixel 6 onwards, OnePlus 12, iQoo 12, and these other phones

Google has announced Android 15 , releasing the beta 2 to developers. The new iteration of Android comes with several new improvements, from enhanced privacy and security to improved performance. Here are the 15 new features that will come to Android phones later this year.Android 15 introduces a plethora of changes, including a bunch of new features like Private Space , Theft Protection , among others.Let's go the 15 of new features that Google announced for Android 15.Android 15 introduces Private Space, a secure, encrypted area within your phone where you can hide and lock away sensitive apps. This feature provides an extra layer of authentication, ensuring that your personal information, such as banking or health data, remains protected from prying eyes.Android 15 bolsters theft protection with features like upgraded factory reset protection, which prevents thieves from resetting and selling your stolen phone without your Google account credentials. The OS will also detect suspicious activities, such as attempts to disconnect your phone or multiple failed log-in attempts, and automatically lock the device to deter theft.Under the hood, Android 15 brings numerous efficiency improvements to optimise app performance and battery life. Foreground services now have a 6-hour limit on dataSync and media processing, pushing them to the background after the time limit to conserve power. The introduction of 16KB page support reduces power draw during app launch and improves camera app opening speed.For users with larger-screen devices like the Pixel Tablet, Android 15 offers enhanced multitasking capabilities. Pin the taskbar, quickly switch between apps, and save preferred split-screen combinations for a seamless navigation experience.Android 15's Predictive Back feature uses animations to show users exactly where the back button will take them, eliminating the frustration of accidentally navigating to the wrong screen. Apps can now provide a Remote View to the Widget Picker, allowing users to preview widgets before placing them on their home screens.Android 15 extends platform support for satellite connectivity, providing a consistent user experience across the satellite connectivity landscape. Apps can now detect when a device is connected to a satellite, giving them more awareness of why complete network services may be unavailable. SMS and RCS apps can also send and receive messages via satellite connectivity.Android 15 introduces app archiving, a feature that allows users to free up storage space by offloading most of an app while retaining user settings and saving data. This feature will be accessible through the Settings app, making it easy for users to manage their device storage.Android 15 upgrades the Find My Device feature, allowing users to locate items like keys, wallets, or luggage using Bluetooth tracker tags from various manufacturers. This enhancement makes it easier for users to keep track of their belongings and find them quickly when misplaced.The Health Connect platform in Android 15 now supports additional health and fitness data types, such as skin temperature and training plans, enabling more comprehensive tracking and analysis.Android 15 introduces new extensions that give developers more control over camera hardware on supported devices. Low-light enhancements give developers control over boosting the brightness of the camera preview, while advanced flash strength adjustments enable precise control of flash intensity when capturing photos.With Android 15, users can share or record just an app window rather than the entire device screen. This feature, previously enabled on Pixel devices, will now be available across the broader Android platform, ensuring that sensitive information remains private during screen-sharing sessions.Android 15 brings several improvements to notifications and customization. Users can now set rich vibrations for incoming notifications by channel, allowing them to distinguish between different types of notifications without looking at their devices. The OS also introduces a new ""colour contrast"" settings page, enabling users to adjust the contrast of text, buttons, and icons in apps for better visibility.There is a new Bluetooth Quick Settings tile that lets users toggle individual connections to connect and disconnect specific devices. The OS also supports the CTA-2075 loudness standard, helping app developers avoid loudness inconsistencies and ensuring users don't have to adjust volume when switching between content constantly.Soon, Google Maps will enable users to access augmented reality (AR) content directly on their phones, providing immersive ways to learn about locations. AR experiences for places like Singapore and Paris are in the works, laying the foundation for an extended reality (XR) platform.Android 15 Beta 2 is now available on these phones – Google Pixel 6 onwards, OnePlus 12, OnePlus 12, Vivo X100, iQoo 12, Nothing 2(a), and select phones from Honor, Lenovo, Nothing, OnePlus, OPPO, Realme, Sharp, Tecno, and Xiaomi.The stable release of Android 15 is expected in late summer or early fall, possibly coinciding with the launch of the Pixel 9 series.","Google has announced Android 15, releasing the beta 2 to developers.

Phone condition: Assess the physical condition of the phone. Look for scratches, dents, or other signs of wear. Check the screen for cracks and ensure all buttons and ports function correctly.

Age of the phone: Determine how old the phone is and consider its release date. Older models may lack software updates and compatibility with newer apps.

Battery health: Battery life is crucial for a smooth user experience. Inquire about the battery health and ask for details on its capacity and degradation over time.

Software updates: Ensure the phone is compatible with the latest software updates from the manufacturer. Older devices may not receive updates, which can impact security and functionality.

Network compatibility: Confirm that the mobile phone is unlocked or compatible with your network carrier. Some phones are locked to specific carriers, limiting your options.

IMEI check: Verify the phone's IMEI number to ensure it's not stolen or blacklisted. This step helps prevent buying a phone with legal issues or unpaid bills.

Performance testing: Test the phone's performance by running apps, browsing the internet, and checking the camera quality. Look for lagging or freezing issues.

Storage capacity: Determine the phone's storage capacity and assess whether it meets your needs for storing photos, videos, and apps.

Price comparison: Research the market value of the phone model you're interested in. Compare prices from different sellers to ensure you're getting a fair deal.

Seller reputation: Buy from reputable sellers with positive reviews or ratings. Avoid transactions with unknown individuals or suspicious online platforms.
