Taylor Swift Shocks Fans With ‘Shake It Off’; Kane Brown’s Surprise Stuns Nashville Crowd

Seemingly determined to make another push into the music spotlight, Paulina Gretzky , daughter of the NHL father figure Wayne Gretzky, attracted some attention this past week. With her strong social media charisma and occasional performances in the past, she just teased her followers with a rather subtle but intriguing glance at what may well be the sound of the near future. This was almost out of character, for it did not resemble a spur-of-the-moment shot; it appeared to be very purposefully staged. In a past life or two, the teenage years have dabbled in entertainment; with these new collaborations in music, this recent post has kept people buzzing once more.Mostly known for the glitz behind being a model and shining on social media, music has always been a shadow lurking behind her. This move looks like more than just a feather in the cap. Over the weekend, she posted on Instagram a picture of her car dashboard displaying a track titled ""If These Heels Co ..."" with her name attached to it. The photo seemed to be an almost clear indication that she had been working on a project, sending her followers into a frenzy of speculation.Indeed, this isn't Paulina's inaugural musical outing: Earlier, she lent her vocals to an album track, ""Collecting Dust,"" which found its way onto MTV's Laguna Beach.Yet she never saw herself full-time as a musician until now, with her current sessions in Nashville marking the deliberate and serious kinds of making music again. With a big partner shop behind her in Tyler Reeve and Chris Young, and entertainment credentials that include Fame and Grown Ups 2, I think she shall carry the weight of the Media to lift her music.The announcement was preceded by some earlier signs indicating that a musical comeback was on its way. In March, Paulina posted a bunch of pictures showing her in a Nashville studio. Some showed her next to the professional soundboard, alongside country singer Tyler Reeve. They seemed relaxed and focused; all clear signs of an actual creative partnership working at full swing. One such image showed Reeve playing guitar while Paulina remained seated beside him, which resembled the organic kind of collaboration that one might expect in a songwriting session.The direction had already been hinted at a few months earlier by Paulina. In December, she had shared Instagram stories with Reeve and Chris Young-the country artist-whilst at the studio for some sort of holiday-related project. The studio was decked out in Christmas lights and a neon sign declaring: ""All I Want for Christmas Is You."" Paulina also posed for a picture with both musicians in front of the decorated tree to cement the warm association.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky’s daughter, Paulina Gretzky, embraces a stunning new look that blends comfort and elegance With her name having been linked to an unreleased song, Paulina Gretzky seems set to embark on a new chapter in her creative life. Regardless of whether the track will become a major release or will remain under the arts-and-crafts category, the stages that this lady is building in the Nashville music scene point toward another chapter. And if there ever was a future for the Gretzky name, fans might be cheering both for style and sound this time around.","Paulina Gretzky posted on Instagram a picture of her car dashboard displaying a track titled ""If These Heels Co..."" with her name attached to it.

The agency will continue to use text alerts to update applicants about their case status.In a related news, the USCIS has issued a strong warning for immigrants, saying that green cards and visas will be revoked if a person breaks the law. In a post on microblogging site X (previously known as Twitter), USCIS shared an image that read: “Green cards and visas will be revoked if an alien breaks the law.” The agency said it will cancel green cards and visas for people found guilty of serious crimes, like supporting or promoting terrorism,a stark reminder that staying in the US is a conditional privilege, not a guaranteed right.In its X post, the US immigration agency stated: “Coming to America and receiving a visa or green card is a privilege. Our laws and values must be respected. If you advocate for violence, endorse or support terrorist activity, or encourage others to do so, you are no longer eligible to stay in the U.S.”","The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced that it will switch to a new phone number for sending text (SMS) messages.

"What is China's mosquito drone? Capable of capturing images, audio & electronic signals",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/what-is-chinas-mosquito-drone-capable-of-capturing-images-audio-electronic-signals-details/articleshow/122090220.cms,"Representative AI image





NEW DELHI: China showcased a miniature, insect-like drone designed for covert surveillance missions, drawing global attention and concern over its potential military and espionage uses.Developed by the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), the drone is just 1.3 cm long and weighs less than 0.3 grams. It was unveiled on the Chinese military broadcaster CCTV-7 as part of an exhibit on next-generation robotic systems.In a demonstration aired over the weekend, NUDT student researcher Liang Hexiang held up the ultra-light robot and said, “Here in my hand is a mosquito-like type of robot. Miniature bionic robots like this one are especially suited to information reconnaissance and special missions on the battlefield.”The drone, resembling a real mosquito, is equipped with two leaf-shaped wings, a slender black body, and three fine wire-like legs. It can reportedly operate silently and without radar detection, carrying ultra-miniature cameras and microphones to capture images, sounds, and electronic signals. Its small size makes it ideal for indoor surveillance, even inside secure government or military facilities.According to The Defense Post, the device’s compact build enables it to evade conventional detection systems and operate in confined spaces — a feature that has raised alarms among privacy advocates and military analysts.Experts warn that such drones could be exploited for espionage, cyber intrusions, or even biological warfare.“This could mean greater access to restricted areas such as secure government facilities,” noted Sam Bresnick, a research fellow at Georgetown University’s Centre for Security and Emerging Technology. “If China is able to produce mosquito-sized drones, it would likely be interested in using them for various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance tasks, especially in places that larger drones struggle to access, such as indoor areas. These drones could be used to track individuals or listen in on conversations.”Other experts are raising more dystopian concerns. Tracey Follows, a futurist and former Google advisor, told The Sun that such drones could be used for “untraceable murders” or carry pathogens, referencing a Black Mirror episode in which robotic insects were weaponised for targeted killings. “In time, one expects a drone to have the situational awareness to carry out an attack autonomously without a human in the loop,” she said. “The big question is what's the payload on these drones, what are you actually attaching to the drone?”The mosquito-sized UAV is part of a broader NUDT programme exploring micro-robotics, with parallel developments including artillery-launched drones that can survive the extreme conditions of being fired from 155mm cannon shells. These innovations reflect China’s ambition to lead in micro-UAV technology, a field seeing increasing global competition.Other countries have made strides in this area. Norway’s Black Hornet, developed by Teledyne FLIR Defence, is already used by militaries worldwide. The latest version, the Black Hornet 4, won the 2025 Blue UAS Refresh award from the US Department of Defence for advancements in battery life, signal range, and wind resistance. Meanwhile, Harvard University’s RoboBee project has demonstrated insect-sized drones that can transition from water to air and even perch on surfaces using static electricity.Beyond military applications, microdrones are being explored for civilian use in medicine, agriculture, and disaster response. In healthcare, they could enable precision drug delivery or internal imaging. In environmental monitoring, their small size allows access to hazardous zones during floods, fires, or chemical spills.Still, with their stealth capabilities and growing autonomy, these tiny machines are poised to become one of the most ethically and strategically complex technologies of the decade.","The drone is just 1.3 cm long and weighs less than 0.3 grams.

Renovation in Action

Entertainment Continues for Visitors





The Dubai Fountain, one of the world’s most iconic and visited attractions, has been out of action since April 2025. Visitors to the Dubai Mall Waterfront Promenade may have noticed its absence, but it’s for a good reason. The fountain is currently undergoing a five-month-long renovation, aimed at upgrading everything from its flooring to its choreography systems.This temporary pause in operations was confirmed by Emaar, the developer behind the landmark, who shared a detailed behind-the-scenes video on Instagram. The sneak peek reveals the enormous effort underway to preserve and improve the performance and aesthetic of what remains the world’s largest choreographed fountain system.According to the video posted by Emaar, one of the main upgrades is the installation of a brand-new flooring system. The previous surface was prone to occasional cracking, which made routine maintenance both necessary and disruptive. The new flooring addresses these challenges with a more durable and visually striking design.Key upgrades include:These aren’t just aesthetic upgrades, they are designed to ensure longer-lasting performance and improved ease of maintenance.To understand the scale of the task, it helps to consider the size of the fountain lake itself, it spans an area equal to 18 football fields. Beneath the still surface lies a sophisticated network of:These elements are meticulously programmed to move in perfect harmony with music. Emaar’s engineering team shared that programming a single song for the fountain show can take several weeks, involving multiple types of robotic systems:Currently, hundreds of workers are involved in the renovation effort, working both in and around the 1.3-metre-deep lake. Though relatively shallow, the water is deep enough to house the powerful jets and robots that give the fountain its signature performance.For cleaning, underwater robots have been deployed. These machines keep the lakebed clean and make use of the newly installed soft flooring, which allows for quicker and more efficient cleaning. Water quality checks are also being conducted regularly, with samples taken from various points across the lake to ensure high standards are maintained.Although the fountain shows are paused, Emaar has ensured that visitors still get a unique experience. The site has been fenced off, but in a smart and creative way.The construction fencing is embedded with digital display screens, which continuously play archival footage of the Dubai Fountain in action, timed beautifully to the Burj Khalifa light show. So while the live performance is temporarily suspended, the spirit and spectacle of the Dubai Fountain remain on full display for anyone visiting the promenade.","The Dubai Fountain is undergoing a five-month-long renovation.

UAE: How UAE-based mother-son startup is using VR for emotional healing in cancer recovery,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-how-uae-based-mother-son-startup-is-using-vr-for-emotional-healing-in-cancer-recovery/articleshow/122186109.cms,"UAE-based startup X-Technology, develops a virtual reality therapy for cancer survivors.

Healing Beyond the Diagnosis

A Long Journey of Innovation in Psychotechnology

Scientific Support and Research on VR Therapy

Real-Life Impact from Users

A Personal Mission to Restore Humanity in Healing





For many cancer patients, the hardest battle begins once treatment ends. While physical pain may lessen, the psychological impact, the fear, anxiety, and loss of direction often lingers much longer. A UAE-based startup, X-Technology, is pioneering a novel form of emotional support using virtual reality (VR) technology to help patients confront these challenges.In an exclusive interview with local news outlet, KT, Nargiz Noimann-Zander, founder of X-Technology, explained, “We don't work with cancer, we work with the psyche. We don’t treat the diagnosis. We help with what the diagnosis does to a person’s emotional state.” Through immersive VR exercises, users are invited to externalize and face their fears in a controlled, virtual environment.David, CTO of X-Technology and Nargiz’s son, further described one of the key VR exercises: “You need to try to hold the fear inside each sphere and make them come closer. When they come close, you see a flow. That means you’re on the right track. It’s all mind-driven.” In this exercise, the user places the same fear into two spheres floating in a galactic space and focuses on merging them until they explode in virtual stardust, symbolizing emotional release.Nargiz has spent over 25 years blending psychology, neuroscience, and technology. Speaking to KT, she shared how her work began out of personal necessity: “One of my sons had serious heart issues when he was a child, and that’s when I started looking into using computer games as a gentle way to support healing.”Her early efforts led to the founding of the Health Centre in 1997, a collaborative space where doctors, psychologists, and neuroscientists sought gentle, science-backed healing methods. Between 1999 and 2003, her team focused on biofeedback to understand psychophysiological states, before developing game-based emotional support tools between 2003 and 2009. “On modest Pentium systems, we built the very first prototypes of game-based interventions,” Nargiz told KT.From 2009 to 2017, these tools evolved by integrating biofeedback and real patient input, culminating in the adoption of VR technology in 2017. By 2019, AI, virtual assistants, and digital twins were added to the platform. Today, X-Technology’s system is used worldwide in clinics, educational institutions, and corporate wellness programs. David emphasized to KT their strict data privacy approach: “We’re very worried about the data. We don’t connect to Wi-Fi or the cloud. Everything is stored offline inside the headset. I don't want anybody to know what's happening in my brain.”Professor Sam Abuomar, Director of the Artificial Intelligence Master’s Programme at Lewis University and visiting professor at the American University of Sharjah, is leading a study evaluating the impact of X-Technology’s VR platform on patients recovering from cancer and those with chronic illnesses. He told KT, “The VR experience has a positive impact because it emulates certain emotional states or past experiences. Especially for high-risk patients, those with conditions like cancer or undergoing chemotherapy, this type of immersive support can improve their emotional and psychological well-being.”Professor Abuomar’s research focuses on memory, emotion, and trauma processing. He explained that future system versions might tailor virtual environments to evoke comforting, familiar experiences, such as family settings or workplaces. He added, “In our literature review, we came across about 15 studies conducted between 2020 and 2025. All of them showed promising results. For example, a 2023 Cleveland Clinic study on 52 cancer patients using interactive therapeutic VR reported significant reduction in depression. Another European study in 2025 on surgical patients found a significant reduction in intraoperative pain.”Though still early, Abuomar and his students have begun pilot testing with 10 patients to compare traditional therapy with VR-based support. “If this proves successful, it could be a big step for this kind of tech-based mental health intervention,” he said.Maria Efimova, a clinical psychologist based in Moscow, shared her experience using the headset for over two years. In a conversation with KT, she said, “The benefits have been tremendous. I’ve seen a significant reduction in anxiety, fears of public speaking, and constant worrying. When I face health-related stress or even physical pain, this is the first thing I turn to. It’s like having a coach on call.”Maria uses two main programs: one to dissolve fears and another to address body-related projections. “My mother uses them too. I often recommend it to my clients. Even after one session, I feel less tension and more calmness,” she said.Nargiz Noimann-Zander’s mission extends beyond technology to restoring empathy and humanity in healing. She leads international research centers and has authored nine books. As a mother of eight and grandmother of three, she reflected in her interview with KT, “When future technologies meet a deep understanding of human consciousness, we access a whole new level of self-awareness and possibility.”Her goal is clear: “It’s not about fighting the disease. It’s about helping people face what it does to their mind and soul and giving them the tools to rise again,” she concluded.","UAE-based startup, X-Technology, develops a virtual reality therapy for cancer survivors.

How the Incident Unfolded

Gulf News

Widespread Use of Social Media for Drug Promotion

Restricted painkillers





Crystal meth





Hashish





Heroin





Other synthetic and illicit substances





Round-the-Clock Cyber Patrols and Parental Role





Sharjah Police have rescued a 13-year-old Emirati boy who developed a drug addiction after receiving unsolicited messages on WhatsApp. The Anti-Narcotics Department at Sharjah Police responded immediately when the child’s father reached out for help. Brigadier Majid Al Asam, Director of the department, shared the details of the case in an exclusive statement to Gulf News.“We received a call from the child’s parent asking for support, and we acted immediately,” Brigadier Al Asam told. The boy had started receiving random WhatsApp messages offering various types of drugs. Without understanding the danger, he transferred money and collected drugs from a location shared by the dealer. These messages are often broadcast to many users across the UAE, targeting vulnerable individuals — even children.Sharjah Police acted promptly and intervened to stop the addiction early, arranging medical and psychological care. Within two weeks, the boy showed clear signs of recovery.“We have continued to follow up on his recovery, and thank God, he is now in good health,” Al Asam said.The case highlights a growing challenge: drug trafficking via the internet, particularly through social networking platforms.In 2024 alone, the Sharjah Police Anti-Narcotics Department recorded 912 cases of drug peddling via WhatsApp, resulting in the arrest of 680 suspects. Authorities also blocked 680 websites and social media accounts that promoted narcotics, counterfeit goods, and banned substances.Brigadier Al Asam described how traffickers use messages or voice notes sent randomly to advertise drugs such as:“Many users buy drugs via the internet and send money online to dealers. Some deposit money in bank accounts and are then informed about the drug location via WhatsApp,” he explained.Sharjah Police have deployed online cyber patrols operating 24/7 to monitor suspicious digital activity. These patrols have already identified 800 different criminal methods used by traffickers and cybercriminals in the UAE.The department urged parents to stay vigilant about their children’s online activity and behavioural changes.“If you notice any changes in your child’s behaviour or signs of drug use, don’t wait. Report it right away. Acting quickly can save your child’s life,” Brigadier Al Asam advised. He stressed that early intervention is key and encouraged families not to delay contacting authorities if they suspect any involvement in drug-related activity.","Sharjah Police rescue 13-year-old boy lured into drug use through WhatsApp messages.

A minor earthquake measuring 3.5 on the Richter scale struck Northern California on Monday evening, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The tremor was recorded at 6.37 pm Pacific Time and was centered approximately 16 miles west of Los Banos and 30 miles southeast of San Jose.The quake was relatively shallow and minor, with no immediate reports of damage or injuries. While it was felt mildly across some nearby areas, the tremor was not severe enough to cause structural concerns. The USGS also indicated that updates to the shake-severity map may follow as scientists process additional field data.Although Monday's quake was minor, experts caution that aftershocks — smaller tremors that follow the main event — may still occur in the same region. According to the USGS, these aftershocks are often subtle fault-line adjustments and can persist for days, weeks, or even years. In rare cases, they may rival or exceed the original quake in strength, posing further risks to already impacted areas.No significant aftershocks have been reported yet.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Enter your beneficiary ID, password, and captcha, then click 'Sign In.' To create and link your ABHA ID, hover your mouse over the 'Update' menu and click on ""Create/Link ABHA ID."" If you're creating an ABHA ID for family members, ensure each family member is mapped after the main cardholder logs in through the ""Beneficiary login."" Select ""I don’t have an ABHA number."" Enter your Aadhaar number, review the terms and conditions, and provide your consent. In the subsequent step, input the OTP sent to your mobile number registered with Aadhaar and click 'Verify OTP.' You'll see the 'Link Status' option. If the details match, you can print the ABHA card by selecting 'print ABHA card.'

If you already have an ABHA number, follow these steps to link it with your CGHS beneficiary ID:

Log in to the CGHS website using your beneficiary ID and password, following the same process as mentioned above until Step 4. After Step 4, click on the 'Link Using ABHA Number' option and enter your ABHA number. Review the consent collection form carefully and provide your consent.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct.

After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

What is changing



Cloudflare, a major internet company, is set to fundamentally change how artificial intelligence (AI) companies access web content, potentially shaking up how AI models are trained. Cloudflare will block AI crawlers by default from accessing content without a website owner's explicit permission or compensation.AI crawlers are automated bots that extract vast amounts of data from websites and other sources to train large language models (LLMs) used by companies like OpenAI and Google . This new tool means every new website signing up with Cloudflare will be prompted to decide if they want to allow AI crawlers. This move effectively gives website owners the power to stop bots from scraping their data.Cloudflare, known as a content delivery network (CDN), plays a crucial role in delivering online content quickly and efficiently. Given that roughly 16% of global internet traffic flows through Cloudflare's CDN, this change carries significant weight.Cloudflare is also introducing a ""pay per crawl"" model, allowing publishers to charge AI crawlers for access to their content. Traditionally, the internet rewarded content creators by directing users to their original websites.However, Cloudflare argues that AI crawlers are disrupting this model by collecting text, articles, and images to generate responses that users don't need to visit the original source for. This practice, according to Cloudflare, deprives publishers of crucial traffic and, consequently, advertising revenue.“AI crawlers have been scraping content without limits. Our goal is to put the power back in the hands of creators, while still helping AI companies innovate,” stated Matthew Prince, Cloudflare's co-founder and CEO. He added that this is about ""safeguarding the future of a free and vibrant Internet with a new model that works for everyone.""","Cloudflare will block AI crawlers by default from accessing content without a website owner's explicit permission or compensation.
