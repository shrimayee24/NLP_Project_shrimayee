The release of Meghan’s book could further inflame tensions between the Sussexes and the Royal Family , particularly following the mixed reception of Harry's memoir, Spare.Bower also criticized Meghan’s acting career, remarking, “The problem is, she isn’t a great actress. Her acting career ended long before she arrived in London - that’s why she came here. She couldn’t find any more work after Suits.”Speculation about Meghan’s autobiography has been circulating since Harry’s book gained attention in early 2023. Some publishing experts believe it is strategic for the couple to delay further releases, as maintaining public interest is crucial. An insider noted, “Fans are fickle. Disappoint them once, and a book can freefall into irrelevance super quickly, even with the momentum of something like Spare behind it. Their team, who are good at what they do, wants to make the angry mobs salivate for it before throwing Meghan’s story to the masses because even the bad press is good press for this couple.”","Royal expert Tom Bower has highlighted the lucrative possibilities of such a book, predicting it could significantly boost their income.

Hobby apps over dating apps? Why fitness and reading platforms are the new matchmakers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/hobby-apps-over-dating-apps-why-fitness-and-reading-platforms-are-the-new-matchmakers/articleshow/113214577.cms,"Strava sees significant growth

Hobby platforms turned social networks

Why the shift?

The changing landscape of social apps

Dating apps like Tinder and Bumble are no longer the go-to platforms for singles seeking love. Instead, people are now turning to Goodreads and Strava , apps initially designed for running, reading, and other hobbies, to find their perfect match.Strava, the popular fitness app known for tracking running and cycling activities, has experienced a substantial 20% increase in user numbers over the past year, according to Sensor Tower and reported by The Guardian.This surge in users has prompted Strava to introduce a new messaging feature, allowing users to connect while tracking their fitness goals.Other hobby-based apps are also seeing a boost in users. Ravelry, a social network for knitting enthusiasts, now boasts a user base of over 9 million. Goodreads, the platform for book lovers, has accumulated more than 150 million members. Meanwhile, Letterboxd , an app for movie enthusiasts, has seen its user base explode from 1.8 million in March 2020 to over 14 million this summer. The app’s impressive 55% growth in monthly active users highlights the increasing popularity of these niche social networks.Dr Carolina Are, a social media researcher at the Centre for Digital Citizens at Northumbria University, explains that these hobby-based apps allow users to connect through shared interests, creating a more engaging and less contentious environment. This focus on common passions reduces the need for stringent content moderation and enhances the overall user experience.Letterboxd’s editor-in-chief, Gemma Gracewood, adds that the app’s design, which includes in-line comments and a community-focused approach, discourages public shaming and amplifies the positive interactions among users. Similarly, Goodreads and Strava offer messaging features that foster connections without the risk of public shaming prevalent on other platforms.As users increasingly migrate from traditional social networks and dating apps, new platforms are emerging as havens for genuine connections. With many abandoning Elon Musk’s social network due to controversies over free speech, apps like Bluesky and Threads are seeing a resurgence, while hobby-based platforms continue to thrive.Are suggests that the lower expectations and less sexually charged atmosphere on these hobby apps create a more relaxed environment for users seeking meaningful connections. Unlike traditional dating apps, which can often feel like a “dating supermarket,” these platforms offer a refreshing alternative for those looking to find love through shared interests.","Strava, the popular fitness app known for tracking running and cycling activities, has experienced a substantial 20% increase in user numbers over the past year.

This designation aims to speed up the development and review of innovative medical devices that address severe conditions.Musk explained that the device could allow individuals who have lost both eyes and their optic nerve to regain sight.For those who have been blind from birth, provided their visual cortex remains intact, the device could offer vision for the first time. Musk described the initial vision quality as being akin to early video game graphics but suggested that future advancements could lead to vision that surpasses natural sight, including the ability to perceive infrared, ultraviolet, or radar wavelengths.""To set expectations correctly, the vision will be at first be low resolution, like Atari graphics, but eventually it has the potential be better than natural vision and enable you to see in infrared, ultraviolet or even radar wavelengths,"" Musk said in a post on X.The breakthrough device designation from the FDA is intended to accelerate the development of devices that offer promising new treatments or diagnostic capabilities for life-threatening conditions. Neuralink, founded by Musk in 2016, is working on brain chip interfaces designed to be implanted in the skull. These chips could potentially restore vision, aid in movement, and facilitate communication for patients with disabilities.Neuralink's Blindsight device has not yet begun human trials, and the company did not provide a timeline for when these trials might start. The FDA has not yet commented further on the development.In addition to the vision-restoring implant, Neuralink is also testing another device aimed at helping paralyzed individuals control digital devices using only their thoughts. This ongoing study is expected to include three patients and span several years. Earlier this year, Neuralink successfully implanted the device in a patient who has since used it to play video games and design 3D objects.","The FDA granted ""breakthrough device"" status to Elon Musk's vision-restoring implant.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Benefits of a pager



Why pagers exploded in Lebanon

A series of explosion of pagers in Lebanon resulted in at least nine fatalities, injuring over 2,700. The blasts occurred on Tuesday (Sep 17) in Beirut's southern suburbs and other areas. In a statement, Hezbollah said that at 3:30 pm (1230 GMT) pagers used by people working for the group’s institutions began exploding “mysteriously.”A senior Lebanese security source claimed that Israel’s Mossad spy agency planted explosives inside these pagers or “beepers” that were ordered months before the blasts.Taiwan's Gold Apollo has refused that it did not make the pagers used in the detonations. Instead, they had been manufactured by a company called BAC which has a licence to use its brand, the company said.A pager is a radio-operated electronic device used for transmitting brief text messages. The device is usually designed to only receive messages, but in some cases can also be used to to send messages. When a pager beeps with a new message, the recipient needs to locate a nearby public or landline phone to respond to the message.Pagers were widely used in the pre-mobile era during the late 1990s. It was a critical communication tool for doctors, journalists and emergency health service providers.There are several types of pagers - numeric, alphanumeric and use case. A numeric pager, as the name suggests, can only display numbers. It is the simplest and easiest pager to use. Alphanumeric, on the other hand, can display both numbers and alphabets. While a use case pager is specially designed for quick alerts and contact information, particularly in professions that require immediate communication.One of the major benefits of using a pager or a beeper is the connectivity range. As a pager works on radio frequencies, it can provide network coverage in remote areas as well. Another benefit is that the pagers are difficult to track - a key reason why Hezabollah was using it. Since a pager is usually meant to only receive a message, it is difficult to trace.Also, compared to mobile phones, pagers offer longer battery life and durability. Also, they are straightforward to use, compared to a mobile phone.While the exact reason is not known yet, reports suggest that overheating of lithium batteries could be a possible reason behind the detonation.

Salesforce launches world’s first AI agent ecosystem: What is it and how it works,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/salesforce-launches-worlds-first-ai-agent-ecosystem-what-is-it-and-how-it-works/articleshow/113436743.cms,"What are AI agents and how can they help customers

Salesforce partners with Google Cloud, AWS, IBM and more to distribute agents

Salesforce has launched Agentforce Partner Network – the world’s first AI agent ecosystem that will allow its partner companies to build third-party AI agents and actions, which then can be used to take on specific tasks depending on the requirements of businesses.In easier words, Salesforce’s Agentforce Partner Network is like an app store for AI assistants/ agents from where customers will be able to easily install these agents and deploy them for specialised industry or business needs.According to Brian Millham, president and COO at Salesforce, the company aims to enable customers with a billion AI agents over the next year.Imagine a really smart digital assistant that can do a bunch of tasks, like answering customer questions or helping you find new sales leads. That's basically an AI agent. AI agents are specifically designed to perform various tasks autonomously, such as reasoning, data retrieval, planning and action execution. For example, an AI agent can be developed specifically to take care of tasks related to employees’ leaves in an organisation, so HRs and managers can easily distribute their time in other works.The Agentforce Partner Network allows these AI agents to interface with multiple systems, databases, and other agents, addressing the complexity of enterprise environments where thousands of applications are typically managed.The platform not only allows customers to access a catalogue of third-party skills, actions and agents within the Salesforce Platform, but also develop new skills to make AI agents even more capable or use available templates to create new agents.Salesforce has announced that the AI agents from Agentforce Partner Network can be accessed and downloaded from partner platforms like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud , Honeywell, IBM, Zoom, and more.","Salesforce partners with Google Cloud, AWS, IBM and more to distribute agents.

WWE 2K24 vs. WWE 2K23: Amazing Details Comparison

As WWE 2K25 approaches, fans are buzzing with excitement and anticipation for the next installment of the popular wrestling video game series. With each new edition, players eagerly look forward to new features, match types, and gameplay improvements. Let us look at some new features that fans would like to see in the sequel of the popular WWE title.There are two key reasons why this needs to be added in WWE 2K25: Firstly, gameplay mechanics, and the other concerns future-proofing.The previous iterations of WWE 2K series focused on particular wrestlers and players could mostly play with certain personalities. Rey Mysterio in WWE 2K22. WWE 2K23 improved on this mechanic and allowed players to control characters who had defeated John Cena. WWE 2K24 shifted focus to WrestleMania.These improvements were valuable, but a Bloodline Showcase could address this issue more effectively, as it could involve at least five different wrestlers: Roman Reigns, Jey Uso, Jimmy Uso, Sami Zayn, and Solo Sikoa. Although Roman Reigns would likely feature in many of these matches, the variety would provide much-needed variety and flexibility.The second reason is that The Bloodline saga is extensive and ongoing, and it might eventually become too lengthy to fit into a single Showcase. In many ways, it's akin to WrestleMania in terms of its scope. WWE 2K14 featured ""Thirty Years of WrestleMania,"" WWE 2K24 showcased ""Forty Years of WrestleMania,"" and it's likely that WWE 2K34 will highlight ""Fifty Years of WrestleMania."" I anticipate that a similar approach will be taken with The Bloodline story in the future. Consider WrestleMania 40 as The Bloodline’s ""Avengers: Endgame"" moment—an epic event so monumental that setting up its next chapter requires time and careful planning.Also read: WWE Hall of Famer Says that Hell in a Cell Might Disrupt Punk-McIntyre's Raw Feud The Strap Match is a classic stipulation that has been a fan favorite for years. In this match, competitors are tethered together by a strap, which can be used as both a weapon and a tool for victory. This match type demands both physical and psychological endurance, as the constant connection between the wrestlers adds a unique twist to the contest. Fans would relish the opportunity to recreate these brutal and exciting encounters in WWE 2K25.The SmackDown games excelled in offering players the freedom to pursue their own interests. While the primary objective is typically to become the top champion, players might prefer to focus on different championships in subsequent playthroughs. For instance, in their third MyRise run, a player might choose to forgo the World title and instead focus on tag team or midcard roles.Similarly, players should not be restricted to a single brand. The ability to switch between Raw, SmackDown, or even NXT adds variety to the opponents they face and the titles they can compete for. This flexibility significantly enhances replay value, helping to keep the game engaging long after its release.Also read: ""I Heard The Entire Show Just Got Ripped In Half"": WWE Superstar Reflects On His Frustrations With Last-Minute Script Changes During Vince McMahon's Tenure Adding this feature would significantly enhance the game by making wins and losses truly impactful. The key is to ensure that victories and defeats feel authentic and occur naturally. Playing as a new wrestler who wins every match except for those lost due to interference quickly becomes monotonous.This approach lacks realism, as every wrestler inevitably experiences losses. Tying this to a previously mentioned improvement, if a player loses a title match, they shouldn't have to replay and win to continue. Instead, they could transition to a new storyline without the championship and work their way back up the ranks.In various video games, players often face a mismatch between the character they create and the voice options available, which can disrupt immersion. For instance, a character with a specific nationality might end up with a voice that doesn't match their background, such as a voice that doesn’t fit their ethnicity.To address this while also considering financial constraints, where hiring multiple voice actors might be costly, another solution could be to make the playable character silent. This approach has been used in numerous games to ensure that no player feels excluded and to allow players of all backgrounds to fully immerse themselves in their roles.Also read: WWE Superstars Who Support Donald Trump","WWE 2K25 is the next installment of the popular wrestling video game series.

The on-field activities are only running and conditioning. It is not until day two that teams can partake in non-contact drills. These include gap, star, outside leverage and cutback. The focus is on technique. Players wear shorts and helmets. There is no live contact allowed. This is a rule that continues until day four. Full padded practices are not permitted before this point.The NFLPA rules state that teams can hold one padded practice a day. This lasts up to three hours. Then after a three-hour break, they may hold a second practice. This is often a walk-through.The total practice time cannot go over four hours. If the padded practice passes an hour the second session is canceled. Teams must also give players at least one day off per week They must receive a total of at least five days off by the end of camp. Sometimes coaches give players additional days off. It is based on their team’s energy levels. They use these days for team-bonding activities, more often than not.Also Read - Record Breaking Viewership of NFL","The NFLPA rules state that teams can hold one padded practice a day.
