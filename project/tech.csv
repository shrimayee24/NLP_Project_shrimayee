'Asked driver to bring a cake'

Sahil, Muskan's Holi celebration

Post-mortem reveals chilling details



NEW DELHI: Muskan Rastogi and her lover Sahil Shukla appeared to have planned an elaborate getaway in the wake of their shocking crime. The duo, accused of murdering Muskan’s husband, former Merchant Navy officer Saurabh Rajput , attempted to evade the authorities by fleeing to Himachal Pradesh immediately after the gruesome act. On March 4, Rajput was drugged, stabbed, dismembered, and his remains were concealed within a cement-filled drum in a chilling murder plot.Immediately after the murder, the pair drove away from Meerut and reached Kasol, in Himachal Pradesh, where they checked into a local hotel on March 10. During their six-day stay, they maintained an unusually low profile.According to the hotel operator, the couple presented themselves as husband and wife and remained secluded in their room, rarely venturing out, as reported by PTI. They avoided interactions with the staff, refused routine housekeeping, and left the room only once daily in a private car.According to PTI sources, Muskan's online conversations and audio exchanges with the cab driver, who transported her and her lover to Himachal Pradesh, were widely shared on social media.""One of the videos revealed that Muskan had sent a voice message to the driver via WhatsApp, requesting him to bring a cake,"" the police said.Another video showed Muskan celebrating her birthday with Sahil, feeding him cake. The duo smiling at the camera, their faces smeared with colours after celebrating Holi, with loud music blaring in the background.The calculated silence of Muskan and Sahil did little to disguise their frantic attempts at cover-up. Their actions were designed to create an illusion of normality; at check-out, they casually informed the hotel operator that they were returning from Manali en route to Uttar Pradesh.Also read: Muskan Rastogi, her lover Sahil Shukla played Holi days after murdering Saurabh Rajput Meanwhile, back in Meerut, a complaint from Rajput’s family finally set the wheels of justice in motion. The case gained momentum when Muskan’s father, Pramod Rastogi, compelled his daughter to confess the horrific details of the murder while on a scooter ride to the police station. It emerged that Muskan, under coercion and influence, had participated in the murder alongside Sahil—her accomplice who allegedly manipulated her into committing the unthinkable.The post-mortem of Saurabh Rajput revealed shocking details about his murder. His head was severed, both hands were amputated, and his legs were bent backward, indicating an attempt to fit the body into a drum. The autopsy confirmed he was stabbed three times in the heart, causing severe bleeding and shock. After dismembering his body, it was sealed in a drum filled with cement, preserving it. The body had to be painstakingly retrieved by cutting open the cement-filled drum.Police investigations soon uncovered that the body, dismembered and sealed in a cement drum, had been recovered from a house, leading to the arrest of both Muskan and Sahil on March 18. During questioning, Sahil reportedly confessed that on the night of the murder he had instructed Muskan: “You have to kill Saurabh if we are to start a new life.” He allegedly directed her to sit on her unconscious husband’s chest and, when she hesitated, guided her hand as she stabbed him in the heart three times.Adding another layer to the case, neighbours recalled Sahil’s eerie behaviour; he was often seen wearing kurtas adorned with ‘Mahakal’ inscriptions and was known for his reclusive habits, such as feeding stray cats and keeping his room cloaked in darkness.Muskan’s mother, Kavita, expressed her anguish and regret that her daughter had never confided in her, attributing Muskan’s secrecy to the possibility of being influenced by drugs or other undisclosed factors.","Muskan Rastogi and her lover Sahil Shukla appeared to have planned an elaborate getaway in the wake of their shocking crime.

Carlos Rodon shines in final Spring Training appearance

Tokyo series opener sets viewership records in Japan

Seattle Mariners introduce blackout-free streaming service

Spring training highlights: Athletics dominate Royals

With Major League Baseball (MLB) on deck for the 2025 season, this week has been doozy — from outstanding spring training performances to flood-inducing broadcasting milestones. So with that in mind, here’s a full rundown of the biggest MLB news and stories from this week.Carlos Rodon closed out his Spring Training on a high note for the New York Yankees, putting together an impressive outing against the Detroit Tigers. Carlos Rodon threw 4 2/3 scoreless innings and 77 pitches in a 4-0 win. After a quiet preseason consisting of three Grapefruit League starts and some live batting practices, Rodón was confident he was ready for the Opening Day assignment against the Milwaukee Brewers at Yankee Stadium.The Yankees’ rotation has struggled, most significantly after Gerrit Cole underwent Tommy John surgery, and other top pitchers have been injured. Rodon's polished repertoire of pitches, highlighted by an elite changeup and two-seam fastball, is the key to team success this season.The inaugural game of the Tokyo Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Chicago Cubs fans captivated in-game audiences in Japan, too, averaging more than 25 million viewers. This was a record for an MLB game in Japan, beating all the previous records. It beats the previous year's Seoul Series viewership record of 18.7 million viewers.On Opening Day there was even a historic all-Japanese pitching matchup, with the Dodgers’ Yoshinobu Yamamoto squaring off against the Cubs’ Shota Imanaga. The Dodgers won that game, 4-1. The next game, featuring a home run from Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Angels and the debut of Roki Sasaki with the Los Angeles Dodgers, drew more than 23 million viewers in Japan.The games had an average of 590,000 viewers in the United States. Merchandise sales for the series climbed with a 320% increase since the previous year’s London games, and Ohtani’s Dodgers jersey topped the sales list.In a groundbreaking move, the Seattle Mariners, together with Root Sports, introduced a new in-market, blackout-free streaming service for just $19.99 a month. This service makes it possible for Mariners fans to watch Mariners games — without subscribing to a traditional cable or satellite TV.Available through a Root Sports streaming app, the service can be accessed on web browsers, smart TVs, and mobile devices, and apps are available on platforms including iOS, Android, Apple TV, and Amazon Fire TV, with plans to launch on Roku soon.The initiative is baseball further evolving its approach to broadcasting, part of the league's slow march towards other teams providing direct-to-streaming as the cable model continues to decline. It’s a cheaper option for fans than the cable packages that once cost a fortune.The Oakland Athletics dominated their spring training opponents, the Kansas City Royals, in a 10-1 blowout win. Jacob Wilson, a rookie, had three hits, and the pitcher Luis Severino went 5 1/3 innings, giving up one run.The lineup continued its offensive assault today with home runs by Brent Rooker and JJ Bleday. In other significant performances, Atlanta Braves’ Chris Sale struck out five in four scoreless innings in a 7-3 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays. Jeremy Peña's three-hit game, which included a home run, lifted the Houston Astros past the St. Louis Cardinals, 5-3.As the 2025 MLB season approaches, teams and fans alike are abuzz with anticipation and are excited for the season to start. The past week's events—from stellar individual performances to significant broadcasting innovations—set the stage for an exciting year in baseball.Also Read: ""It's different"": Dodgers 2B Tommy Edman reflects on Dodgers presence as team sweeps Tokyo Series games against Cubs","Carlos Rodon shines in final Spring Training appearance for the New York Yankees.

Jameis Winston closing in on Giants deal— what it means for Aaron Rodgers and the NFC East race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jameis-winston-closing-in-on-giants-deal-what-it-means-for-aaron-rodgers-and-the-nfc-east-race/articleshow/119326798.cms,"Credit: Imagn Images

Jameis Winston joins the New York Giants: What it means for the Quarterback room



What Winston brings to the Giants



What this means for Aaron Rodgers and the Giants



The New York Giants have made a significant move at the quarterback position, though it may not be the one many anticipated. The team has secured the services of veteran quarterback Jameis Winston on a two-year deal worth $8 million, as reported by NFL Media. Winston himself confirmed the signing on social media, signaling a fresh chapter in his career with Big Blue. However, the signing raises more questions than answers, particularly regarding the Giants' long-term plans at quarterback and how this impacts their potential pursuit of Aaron Rodgers.While adding Winston provides the Giants with much-needed experience under center, it does not necessarily take them out of the running for other quarterbacks. NFL Media has indicated that New York remains open to acquiring additional talent, whether through free agency—where Rodgers is still available—or via the upcoming NFL Draft, where Shedeur Sanders is a strong candidate for the No. 3 overall pick.If the Giants do decide to draft a quarterback, Winston could serve as a transitional figure, helping to mentor a rookie and providing a stabilizing presence as they adjust to the NFL. This signing also reflects the Giants' ongoing search for a veteran signal-caller after missing out on other targets, such as Matthew Stafford, who opted to stay with the Los Angeles Rams.Despite Winston’s experience, his contract suggests that he is not necessarily being viewed as the long-term solution. At $8 million over two years, the financial commitment is relatively modest, positioning him more as a bridge quarterback rather than the definitive starter. Before this signing, Tommy DeVito was the only quarterback on the Giants’ roster, highlighting the team’s urgent need for additional depth at the position.Winston, 31, brings a wealth of experience to the Giants' locker room. Having entered the league as the No. 1 overall pick in 2015 with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he has started 87 regular-season games throughout his career. His career statistics include 24,225 passing yards, 154 touchdowns, and 111 interceptions, with an 86.4 passer rating. Last season, Winston made seven starts for the Cleveland Browns, where he completed 61.1% of his passes for 2,121 yards, throwing 13 touchdowns against 12 interceptions.His experience as a starter makes him a viable short-term option for the Giants, particularly if they draft a young quarterback. While he may not possess the same ceiling as elite quarterbacks, his presence ensures the team has a competent signal-caller who can step in and lead the offense if needed.The timing of Winston’s signing is particularly interesting, as it coincided with Aaron Rodgers’ visit with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Giants have long been rumored as a potential destination for Rodgers, and some speculated that bringing in Winston might signal a shift away from those plans. However, according to Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer, Winston’s signing does not affect the Giants' pursuit of Rodgers. ""Winston is nothing more than a veteran for the QB room,"" Breer reported, emphasizing that the team’s interest in Rodgers remains unchanged.Rodgers, who remains the highest-profile quarterback on the free-agent market, left his visit with the Steelers without a deal. That leaves open the possibility that New York could still make a push for him. If the Giants were to sign Rodgers, it would likely alter their draft strategy, making it less urgent to select a quarterback early.Alternatively, if the Giants opt not to sign Rodgers, Winston could hold the starting job temporarily while a rookie quarterback develops. This approach aligns with how other teams have managed young signal-callers, easing them into the starting role rather than throwing them into the fire immediately.The signing of Jameis Winston provides the New York Giants with a veteran presence at quarterback, but it does not offer a definitive answer to the team’s long-term plans. While Winston is a capable starter with extensive experience, his arrival does not rule out the possibility of adding another quarterback, either through free agency or the draft.Also Read: ""Because I caught it early, we were able to treat it”: Erin Andrews encourages regular doctor visits after cervical cancer battle With Rodgers still available and the Giants holding the No. 3 pick in the upcoming draft, the quarterback landscape in New York remains fluid. Whether Winston ultimately becomes the starter or serves as a mentor for a young quarterback, his presence ensures that the Giants are better prepared at the position heading into the 2025 season. However, until Rodgers makes a decision or the Giants finalize their draft-day plans, the question remains: who will be leading the team under center when the season kicks off?","The New York Giants have signed veteran quarterback Jameis Winston on a two-year deal worth $8 million. The signing raises more questions than answers, particularly regarding the Giants' long-term plans at quarterback and how this impacts their potential pursuit of Aaron Rodgers. While Winston provides the Giants with much-needed experience, it does not necessarily take them out of the running for other quarterbacks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119326774,imgsize-34598,width-400,resizemode-4/119326774.jpg"

A New Jersey man is suing United Airlines, alleging that a pilot forcibly removed him from an aeroplane bathroom mid-flight while his pants were still down before having him arrested.The passenger, 20-year-old Yisroel Liebb , says he was flying from Mexico to Texas when he experienced constipation and spent an extended period in the restroom.

Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

“I feel a huge percentage of adhd is screen addiction and dopaminergic burn out. I think the nature of this uninformed social media mental health subculture is rly a big concern. Some are great ofc but a lot of these seem like explicitly anti civilizational and geared towards making people worse.”

Grimes shares the hardest part of parenting

“Why is putting kids to bed arguably one of the hardest things to accomplish. I remember being a horror about going to bed too What is the evolutionary reason for this Am I missing something? Like the story can't be too good or they get turnt and wake up - meaning it has to be an exercise in bad art. I deeply resent having to spend so much time with bad art in order to bore children to sleep - something seems morally wrong here - and like conceptually wrong. Is there a way to not wake them up with cool ideas or art and still get them to sleep? Is this common issue? I know I tortured my parents with this same thing - like demanding more and more stories and taking like an hour or more to sleep and getting up if they tried to leave the room before I was asleep.”
