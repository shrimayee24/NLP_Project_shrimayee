SpaceX: Why Elon Musk's Megazilla catching the booster was such a leap forward for mankind,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-elon-musks-megazilla-catching-the-booster-was-such-a-leap-forward-for-mankind/articleshow/114254026.cms,"This image provided by SpaceX shows SpaceX's mega rocket booster returning to the launch pad to be captured during a test flight Sunday, Oct. 13, 2024, in Boca Chica, Texas. (SpaceX via AP)

WATCH: SpaceX catches Starship rocket booster back at the launch pad

The launch of SpaceX ’s fifth Starship test flight was remarkable, featuring a booster rocket with twice the power of the Apollo programme’s Saturn V, cutting through the early-morning sky on a bright column of flame tinged with blue. However, the true spectacle lay in the landing of the booster stage, which was extraordinary even by SpaceX’s standards.After falling back from the edge of space, the 71-metre-long steel booster, larger than the fuselage of a Boeing 747, was still travelling at roughly the speed of sound just a kilometre above the Earth.Thirteen of its 33 engines reignited, rapidly decelerating the rocket to a few hundred kilometres per hour. Then, most of the engines were switched off, leaving it balanced precariously on the thrust of just three engines, akin to a broomstick balanced on a finger.The engines guided the booster back to the 146-metre-tall gantry tower from which it had launched only seven minutes earlier. As it descended past the tower, at a slightly worrying angle, the tower’s massive arms closed around the rocket, bringing it to a stop high in the Texas sky. The booster rested there, flames still sporadically licking around its base—an awkward yet incredible sight.This successful landing was a major triumph for SpaceX engineers, reinforcing the idea that the company’s ambitious plans to use a massive reusable booster to launch an equally massive reusable spacecraft, the Starship, on a regular basis could become a reality. This development could significantly increase the amount of cargo SpaceX can transport to orbit, both for itself and its customers, including the US government, in the second half of this decade.The cost per tonne of launching payloads into orbit is also expected to plummet. Citigroup estimates that SpaceX’s semi-reusable Falcon 9 rockets, which are flown frequently, have already reduced launch costs by a factor of ten. A fully reusable Starship could reduce costs even further, potentially making the leap in spaceflight technology the most significant since the 1960s.Further evidence that such advancements are close at hand came when, about an hour after the booster returned to the pad, the Starship itself successfully splashed down in the Indian Ocean. Unlike the booster, the Starship must re-enter Earth’s atmosphere at orbital velocities exceeding 26,000 kilometres per hour. During this test flight, the heat shielding, which protects the craft during re-entry, performed much better than it had in June’s previous test, though not perfectly. Some of the Starship’s structure was visibly burning, causing concern among the SpaceX employees watching the live feed. Nevertheless, the Starship executed its landing manoeuvres as planned and splashed down in the intended location, with the return captured on camera by a buoy placed specifically for that purpose.The flight showcased how far SpaceX is ahead of its competition. The engineers were able to recover their booster thanks to years of experience landing the smaller Falcon 9 first stages. Since 2015, SpaceX has landed over 300 Falcon 9 first stages, which have their own landing legs, eliminating the need for mid-air capture. No other rocket company has achieved a reusable first stage yet, although some are close. Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin plans to test a similar rocket in the coming months, while RocketLab, a smaller startup, aims to launch one next year. Several Chinese companies are also working on this technology.SpaceX still has more tests ahead. It must demonstrate that the Starship can switch its engines on and off in space, achieve a proper orbit, and then safely return to Earth, eventually landing in the arms of a gantry. However, SpaceX is known for its rapid pace of testing. After completing two test flights in 2023, this was the third in 2024, and the frequency is expected to increase. This success suggests that while there may be setbacks, the company could achieve initial operational capability within a few years.Once operational, Starship will have plenty of missions. NASA ’s Artemis programme, which aims for crewed human landings on the Moon, relies heavily on Starship’s ability to reach orbit regularly—perhaps as often as once a week. SpaceX’s plans to expand its Starlink satellite network, which already has over 6,000 satellites in orbit, also hinge on the Starship’s capabilities. Additionally, Elon Musk ’s long-term goal of colonising Mars is still in play. He has mentioned plans to send five uncrewed Starships to Mars by 2026, with crewed missions following shortly after.While Musk’s broader vision for Mars includes safeguarding civilisation, it also ties into his controversial political views, including his support for the re-election of Donald Trump and his use of the social network X as a platform for spreading misinformation. These aspects have raised concerns, but with the Super Heavy booster safely in its cradle, the prospect of reaching Mars looks more tangible than ever.","SpaceX has completed its fifth test flight of its Starship rocket.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

This added layer ensures the safety of NPS transactions and protects the interests of subscribers and stakeholders.The login process for NPS CRAs is changing. Following the circular, Aadhaar-based authentication will now be combined with the current user ID and password login system.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Rikishi’s Perspective: A Missed Heel Turn

“I almost feel like, man, I would have thought, and this is just my weird mind, I’m always thinking, when people go left, I go right, during that time, it damn sure would have been nice if Cody turned on Roman,”

“This was once a guy that people hated his guts, but as you can listen, man. You be got the champion, and you’ve got a guy that lost to the champion, making his [return], coming back to wrestle, and the building erupted.”

“So I thought, man, it’s gonna happen right now. In my mind, I said, ‘This would be the perfect time for Cody to switch up.’”

“So now you switch up, you have Cody and Roman come back, and boom, Roman’s already a babyface now. Boom, the belt drops to Roman, boom here comes The Rock. Now we can continue on.”

Cody’s Potential as a Heel

“Cody is sharp-dressed. He’s a babyface, but he’s one of those guys that you can hate real quick. When you see him on TV, his promos, almost like arrogant. He’s a nice guy, but arrogant.”

Let’s get into it.Also Read: WWE NXT Results and Highlights 10/15 Roxanne Perez is the undisputed top dog when it comes to female talent in NXT. She has held onto the NXT Women’s title for almost 200 days now, despite being just 22. Perez has her whole career ahead of her and is already one of the best female talents in WWE, and that alone makes her worthy of a spot in the 2025 Women’s Royal Rumble match.Moreover, Perez’s call-up to the main roster has been long overdue, and putting her in the Women’s Royal Rumble match would be an excellent way to take her away from NXT.Giulia has only just arrived in WWE, but at a single glance, it is clear to see why she was such a huge deal during her time in Japan. She has unmatched charisma, does a lot of smart work in the ring, and her attire sets her apart from the rest of the roster. If it wasn’t for the language barrier, fans would already be hailing Giulia as the top NXT wrestler.Moreover, even if we take away Giulia’s time in NXT, her time in Japan alone makes her worthy of a spot in WWE’s Royal Rumble match. At the time of writing, it is highly unlikely that Giulia will be a part of Royal Rumble, but that doesn't mean that she isn’t worthy of a spot.As someone who has only had two years of experience in the ring, Tatum Paxley sure is an impressive wrestler. She has a ton of charisma, does good work on the mic and is an incredible athlete. Moreover, the sheer amount of growth that Tatum has been through over the past two years makes her almost unrecognizable.It is clear to see that Paxley is a star that’s committed to constant improvement. If she continues to improve the way she has so far, it won’t be long before Tatum is running the women’s division. Her style of fighting, her love for the game, and her ability to get the fans on her side makes Paxley deserving of a spot in the 2025 Women’s Royal Rumble match.If you were to make a list of NXT stars with untapped potential, Je’Von Evans would top the list for men, while Sol Ruca would dominate the women. Sol’s athleticism sets her apart from the rest of the NXT roster. Her incredible moveset gets more than a few gasps from the fans and make her matches a must match.With just a little bit of character and mic work, Ruca will be ready to become the next big thing in NXT. Even now, she is one of the most exciting talents on the roster, making her worthy of a spot in the 2025 Women’s Royal Rumble match.A Royal Rumble match can’t be a true battle without an overpowering presence like Jaida Parker in the ring. There aren’t many female wrestlers in WWE who can keep up with the sheer physicality of Jaida Parker, and that alone will make her an exciting addition to the 2025 Women’s Royal Rumble match.But, Parker shouldn’t be included just because she’s a physical anomaly, instead she should be included because of her place amongst the NXT women. After Roxanne Perez and Giulia, there aren’t many NXT talents who can put on a show quite like Jaida Parker can, and that alone should be enough to get her into the 2025 Women’s Royal Rumble match.Also Read: WWE NXT hotel ejects fan twice for alleged attempt to take photos of female wrestlers' feet","NXT is WWE ’s developmental brand, it is the place where all young talent goes to develop their skills before making the jump to the main roster. Most of the names associated with NXT are very raw since they’re still at the earliest stages of their career in the ring. Despite lacking experience, NXT has wrestlers who could put some of the biggest stars of the game to bed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114278253,imgsize-2691794,width-400,resizemode-4/114278253.jpg"

In 2018, he set the record for the most sacks by a defensive tackle in a season with an impressive 19.5 sacks.

Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski have always been close, both on and off the football field. Together, they helped forge one of the most explosive duos in NFL history, winning four Super Bowls as a team.
