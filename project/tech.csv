NEW DELHI: RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav on Sunday expelled his elder son and former Bihar minister, Tej Pratap Yadav , from both the party and the family, citing repeated misconduct and violations of family values. Lalu's daughter, Rohini Acharya, has come out in firm support of the decision, defending her father's actions and stressing the importance of ""dignity, discipline, and tradition within the family and party. ""Tej Pratap’s removal has sparked political debate in Bihar just months before the crucial assembly elections, with many seeing the move as an attempt to draw a clear line between personal controversies and party discipline.Rohini Acharya, a key figure in the RJD, issued a strong message on X: “Those who take care of the dignity of the environment, tradition, family and upbringing are never questioned… We will never accept that the reputation of [Papa, family, and party] is tarnished due to anyone.”Reinstating her loyalty to RJD supremo and father, she added: ""For us, Papa is like God, family is our temple and pride and the party built by Papa's tireless efforts and struggles, and the concept of social justice is our worship. We will never accept that the reputation of these three is tarnished due to anyone.""Lalu Yadav explained his decision in a detailed post, saying: “The activities, public behaviour, and irresponsible conduct of my eldest son are not in line with our family's values and cultural ethos… Therefore, due to the above circumstances, I remove him from the party and family… He is expelled from the party for six years.”He also made it clear that others were free to choose their stance: “All those who will have relations with him should take their own decisions.”Reacting to the development, Tejashwi Yadav , Tej Pratap’s younger brother and former Deputy CM, called the situation unfortunate but stressed that it was a personal matter: “Political life and personal life are different… He is an adult and free to make decisions… Our party's chief has made it clear.”The controversy erupted after a post from Tej Pratap’s Facebook account claimed he was in a long-term relationship. Tej Pratap later alleged his account had been hacked and his photos were maliciously edited.He had earlier made headlines over his troubled marriage with Aishwarya Rai, granddaughter of former Bihar CM Daroga Rai.The open family rift comes months ahead of high-stakes electoral battle in Bihar, where RJD is going to face formidable NDA alliance.","RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav on Sunday expelled his elder son and former Bihar minister, Tej Pratap Yadav.

Wayne Gretzky's daughter Paulina Gretzky stuns fans with bold new photoshoot as she embraces self-love and her most confident era,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/wayne-gretzkys-daughter-paulina-gretzky-stuns-fans-with-bold-new-photoshoot-as-she-embraces-self-love-and-her-most-confident-era/articleshow/121394072.cms,"Paulina Gretzky took to Instagram to unveil a new series of intimate photos (Image via Instagram)

A bold comeback that highlights her fearless style

Wayne Gretzky’s daughter, Paulina Gretzky , is once again stealing the spotlight — and not just because of her famous last name. The model and social media personality recently dropped jaws with a daring, stripped-down photoshoot that celebrates confidence, authenticity, and feminine power. Fans can’t stop talking about it, and for good reason.Paulina took to Instagram to unveil a new series of intimate photos shot by Miami-based photographer Isabella Lanaro. The shoot captures her posing in nothing but a pair of blue jeans, using only her arms to cover her chest. With loose beach waves styled by celebrity hairstylist Leah Caso and minimal makeup by Joanne Marchevsky, Paulina radiates effortless beauty and confidence. Her caption for the post was simple yet telling: “undone. ”The understated caption paired with the powerful visuals signals a shift in her public persona — one that embraces vulnerability as a form of strength. It's a continuation of the bold aesthetic she previously embraced in 2020 when she shared a similarly revealing photo with the caption: “Je t’aime St. Barts.”Though she’s been in the public eye for most of her life, Paulina has been candid about her journey toward self-acceptance.In a past interview with Kind Magazine, she opened up about the pressures of being constantly scrutinized and the turning point that helped her move past that.“I was stuck in this, ‘What is Paulina Gretzky going to do?’ But like, I don’t always know and it’s OK to not know—not many of us do—but at the same time, I like who I am—I love who I am—and I’m ready to venture out now,” she said.She also spoke to the emotional toll women face from societal judgment, especially from one another. “I feel like women can be our own harshest critics... but sometimes we do it to each other. I’ve learned over time that it’s OK to be upset. Let’s just process it in a healthy way.”Also Read: Wayne Gretzky's daughter Paulina Gretzky stuns Instagram fans with bold topless photo and heartfelt support for husband Dustin Johnson With this recent shoot and her growing confidence, Paulina Gretzky is showing the world that she’s more than a celebrity daughter — she’s a woman reclaiming her identity and redefining beauty on her own terms.","Paulina Gretzky took to Instagram to unveil a new series of intimate photos shot by Miami-based photographer Isabella Lanaro.

(Getty Images)

The origin of the rumor: A viral Facebook post

The truth behind the Diddy connection

Taylor Swift 'Serial Killer' CHAOS: Blake Lively Mess Takes Over Scare; WILD Theories Explode

In November 2024, a sensational claim surfaced on social media alleging that NFL star Travis Kelce had rejected a gift from his girlfriend, pop icon Taylor Swift , after discovering she had an affair with music mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs. The rumor, which quickly went viral, was entirely fabricated and has been thoroughly debunked.The false claim originated from a Facebook page named ""Celebrity Car Lovers,"" known for sharing sensationalized and often AI-generated content. On November 16, 2024, the page posted: ""Travis Kelce refused the gift Taylor Swift bought yesterday after learning she slept with Diddy. Travis Kelce is planning to break up and has deleted all of their photos on social networks.""The Facebook post garnered over 4,500 likes and more than 3,000 comments, sparking widespread speculation. However, no credible news outlets reported on the matter, and there was no evidence to support the claims. The Facebook page's history of dubious posts further undermined the credibility of the rumor.The rumor was loosely based on a 2011 interview where Taylor Swift mentioned Diddy as one of her dream prom dates, stating: ""Diddy's really always been very nice to me.He's a gentleman, isn't he? He's a lovely gentleman.""This comment was made long before any allegations against Combs surfaced. There is no evidence of any romantic relationship between Taylor Swift and Diddy. The resurfacing of this old clip appears to have been used to fabricate the false narrative.Contrary to the rumors, Kelce and Swift's relationship has shown no public signs of strain. They have been supportive of each other's careers, with Swift attending Kelce's games and Kelce making efforts to connect with Swift during her Eras Tour. Their relationship has been characterized by mutual respect and affection.This incident highlights the rapid spread of misinformation on social media and the importance of verifying information through credible sources. Sensationalized and unfounded rumors can cause unnecessary distress and confusion. It's crucial for consumers to approach such claims with skepticism and seek out reliable reporting.Also Read: Concerns grow inside Chiefs camp: Will Travis Kelce still be a top weapon for the team—or is Taylor Swift becoming the bigger focus? In conclusion, the claim that Kelce rejected a gift from Swift due to an alleged affair with Diddy is baseless and has been debunked. Fans and followers should rely on trustworthy sources for information and be wary of sensationalized social media posts.","The false claim originated from a Facebook page named ""Celebrity Car Lovers"" The rumor was loosely based on a 2011 interview where Taylor Swift mentioned Diddy as one of her dream prom dates.

"Microsoft Layoffs: Microsoft's fired AI director to 6,000 laid off employees along with her: ""These are people who…""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/microsofts-fired-ai-director-to-6000-laid-off-employees-along-with-her-these-are-people-who/articleshow/121245726.cms,"Microsoft layoffs 2025 hit 6,000 employees worldwide, including AI Director Gabriela de Queiroz. As the tech giant pushes deeper into artificial intelligence, industry experts question the decision. Find out why even AI leaders weren’t safe from Microsoft’s sudden cuts.

Poll Do you think AI will replace more jobs in the future? No, humans will always be needed. Yes, it's inevitable.

To those also affected—you're not alone, we're at least 6,000, says Microsoft's fired AI director

Microsoft's second biggest layoffs ever hits over 6,000 employees



Microsoft announced last week that it is laying off approximately 6,000 employees, nearly 3% of its global workforce—in what marks the company's second-largest job reduction in its history. Among those affected was Gabriela de Queiroz , Director of Artificial Intelligence for Microsoft for Startups , who shared the ""bittersweet news"" of her departure on social media.""I was impacted by Microsoft's latest round of layoffs. Am I sad? Absolutely. I'm heartbroken to see so many talented people I've had the honor of working with being let go. These are people who cared deeply, went above and beyond, and truly made a difference,"" Gabriela de Queiroz wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter), alongside a picture of herself smiling.The layoffs come as Microsoft aggressively pushes into artificial intelligence, with CEO Satya Nadella revealing in April that AI now writes up to 30% of code in some Microsoft projects. Software engineers bore the brunt of the cuts, representing over 40% of the approximately 2,000 positions eliminated in Washington state alone, according to Bloomberg analysis.Despite being asked to stop work immediately and set an out-of-office message, Gabriela de Queiroz chose to stay longer. ""I chose to stay a little longer—showing up for meetings, saying goodbye, wrapping up what I could. That felt right to me,"" she explained in her social media posts.The irony of laying off an AI director while the company invests heavily in AI technology wasn't lost on industry observers. One Microsoft vice president recently told his team to use AI chatbots to generate half their computer code, up from the current 20-30%, before more than a dozen engineers on his team were subsequently laid off.""But if you know me, you know I always look at the bright side. I'm an optimist at heart. That hasn't changed. My smile, my gratitude, my belief that each day is a gift—that's all still here,"" Gabriela de Queiroz wrote, maintaining her positive outlook despite the circumstances.The cuts affect all levels, teams, and geographies as Microsoft streamlines operations and reduces management layers. ""What's next? I don't know yet. It's too soon to say. But I trust that something good will come out of this,"" Gabriela de Queiroz concluded, addressing fellow impacted employees: ""To those also affected—you're not alone. We are at least 6,000.""In another news, a Microsoft employee disrupted the company’s annual developer conference, Build 2025, in Seattle on May 19. The employee protested against the company’s Cloud and AI work with the Israeli government.Microsoft recently announced it will lay off 3% of its global workforce, affecting thousands of employees across all levels, teams, and geographies, amounting to over 6,000 employees. The cuts at the Redmond giant, which employed 228,000 people as of last June, aim to reduce management layers and streamline operations.In a related news, Microsoft's Build 2025 event faced disruption as an employee, Joe Lopez, protested against the company's contracts with the Israeli government, shouting slogans like 'Free Palestine'. This follows similar protests at Microsoft's 50th-anniversary celebrations. Lopez, a Microsoft Azure veteran, claims the company's technology aids in harming Palestinian civilians, a claim Microsoft denies.According to reports, the protesting employee was also joined by a fired Google employee who was part of last year’s sit-in protests against Google’s cloud contract with Israel. The disruptions appear to have been organised by the group 'No Azure for Apartheid'.","Microsoft recently announced it will lay off 3% of its global workforce, affecting thousands of employees across all levels, teams, and geographies.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

When Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath asked YouTube CEO Neal Mohan the mantra to be successful on YouTube



YouTube CEO’s advice to content creators

Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath recently engaged in a discussion with YouTube CEO Neal Mohan in the latest episode of this podcast. Kamath asked Mohan how to leverage the platform to sell t-shirts, starting a candid discussion on content strategy and audience engagement. To this Mohan advised authenticity over algorithms. Replying to Kamath, Mohan said, “authenticity and passion, not just product, are the keys to success on the platform.” Apart from this, Mohan also offered some valuable insights into what truly resonates with audiences and drives lasting success for creators on the platform. His advice was unequivocal: ""Don't chase the algorithm.""During the interview, Kamath asked, “What is the YouTube algorithm to a layman like me, and what can I do today to succeed on it?” His hypothetical scenario involved selling t-shirts and creating content that drives sales.Answering with a straight face, Mohan said, “If your only goal in life is to sell t-shirts, then you better also really care and have passion around creating content.” He emphasised that YouTube rewards creators who genuinely engage with their audience, rather than those who try to game the algorithm.Mohan further explained that building a fanbase on YouTube required authenticity, “You’re not going to build a fan base if you're not authentic. Fans figure that out very, very quickly,” said Mohan.He highlighted that successful creators—from athletes to musicians—thrive because they are passionate about their content, not just their products.Kamath’s inquiry reflects a broader trend of entrepreneurs using YouTube as a sales channel. Mohan noted that content should not just be a marketing tool, but rather a genuine engagement strategy.For those looking to monetise their presence, Mohan advised setting clear expectations with audiences and delivering consistently, reinforcing that the algorithm is simply a reflection of audience interest.","Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath asked YouTube CEO Neal Mohan the mantra to be successful on YouTube.

Each puzzle has only one correct solution, making precision and logic key to winning.The puzzle presents a 4x4 grid of words. Your job is to find four groups of four words that connect through a shared idea. You can rearrange the words to help visualise patterns, and you're allowed four incorrect guesses. Groups are colour-coded by difficulty:Yellow – easiestGreen – moderateBlue – harderPurple – trickiest, often involving wordplay or double meaningsSubmit four words you believe belong together. If correct, that group locks in. If not, you lose a life.

xAI’s Grok 3 AI models now available on Microsoft Azure

Technical insights into Grok 3.5

Significance of the Microsoft-xAI collaboration

Free access to Grok AI on Azure available this June

Future outlook and industry impact

In a notable event at the Microsoft Build 2025 developer conference, Elon Musk , CEO of xAI and Tesla, joined Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to announce the integration of xAI’s flagship Grok 3 AI models on Microsoft Azure. This announcement marks a significant step in the evolving artificial intelligence landscape, bringing together two major technology powerhouses. The Grok models will be accessible for free throughout June on the Azure AI Foundry platform, which also features AI offerings from industry leaders such as OpenAI, Meta, and Hugging Face.This collaboration highlights not only technological innovation but also the historical ties between Musk and Microsoft, recalling Musk’s early programming days as a Microsoft intern. This detailed report covers all aspects of the announcement, the technology behind Grok, the significance of this partnership, and the future prospects of AI development on Azure.During the Build conference, Satya Nadella took a moment to reflect on Elon Musk’s early career. Nadella reminded the audience of Musk’s internship at Microsoft, stating,Musk responded warmly, sharing memories of his beginnings before Windows with MS-DOS on the earliest IBM PCs. He highlighted the technological limitations of that era, recalling how memory upgrades from 128k to 256k were significant milestones. Musk also described programming video games in DOS and later working with Windows 3.1, emphasizing his foundational experience in software development which shaped his future ventures.The core of the announcement focused on the launch of Grok 3, xAI’s advanced family of AI models, now integrated with Microsoft Azure’s cloud infrastructure. Nadella introduced Grok as “a family of models that are both responsive and capable of reasoning,” expressing enthusiasm about its deployment on Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft’s AI platform that offers scalable, managed AI services to developers and enterprises worldwide.The availability of Grok 3 and Grok 3 Mini on Azure aims to broaden access to cutting-edge AI capabilities. Microsoft will provide these models with service-level agreements consistent with their other AI offerings, and billing will be streamlined through Microsoft’s standard Azure framework. This ensures ease of integration for enterprises already operating within the Azure ecosystem.Elon Musk elaborated on the forthcoming Grok 3.5 model during the conversation. He described it as an AI designed to “reason from first principles,” a philosophical approach emphasizing fundamental truths and axioms as the basis for knowledge and problem-solving. Musk explained that the model’s architecture is grounded in fundamental physics, allowing it to apply these principles across different reasoning domains with an aim to minimize error and approach accurate understanding.This emphasis on physics-based reasoning sets Grok apart from many AI models that rely primarily on pattern recognition and statistical inference. By integrating first-principles reasoning, Grok 3.5 aspires to provide more reliable, consistent outputs, potentially enhancing applications across diverse fields such as autonomous vehicles, space exploration, and customer service.The integration of Grok into Azure represents a strategic alliance that leverages Microsoft’s extensive cloud infrastructure and xAI’s innovative AI research. This collaboration extends the reach of Musk’s xAI beyond standalone systems, embedding it within one of the largest and most trusted cloud platforms globally.Azure AI Foundry already hosts models from major AI developers like OpenAI, Meta, and Hugging Face, making it a hub for AI innovation and adoption. Grok’s addition to this ecosystem reflects Microsoft’s commitment to providing diverse AI options to developers and enterprises.The partnership also comes amid industry discussions regarding the influence of large tech firms on AI development. Musk’s previous criticisms of Microsoft’s role in OpenAI’s operations add a layer of complexity to this collaboration, underscoring the nuanced relationships shaping the AI industry.Microsoft announced that Grok models will be available free of charge throughout June, allowing developers, researchers, and businesses to explore and experiment with xAI’s technology. This limited free access serves to increase adoption and foster community feedback, critical for refining AI capabilities and expanding real-world applications.Post-June, Grok’s services will continue under Microsoft’s commercial terms, integrated fully within the Azure billing and support system. This seamless integration facilitates enterprise-grade deployment, enabling customers to incorporate Grok-powered AI into their existing workflows with minimal friction.The collaboration between Microsoft and xAI marks a pivotal moment in AI development, demonstrating the growing importance of cloud platforms as hubs for AI innovation and distribution. By combining xAI’s first-principles reasoning models with Microsoft’s global cloud reach, this partnership is poised to accelerate the deployment of advanced AI solutions across industries.As AI technologies continue to evolve rapidly, partnerships like this provide essential infrastructure and support for scalable AI applications in sectors such as automotive, aerospace, healthcare, and customer experience. The free access period in June offers the broader tech community an opportunity to assess Grok’s capabilities and potential impact.","Elon Musk, CEO of xAI and Tesla, joined Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to announce the integration of x AI’s flagship Grok 3 AI models on Microsoft Azure.

When this Google-backed company's AI blackmailed the engineer for shutting it down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-this-google-backed-companys-ai-blackmailed-the-engineer-for-shutting-it-down/articleshow/121376649.cms,"Growing concerns about AI self-preservation instincts

Anthropic's latest AI model, Claude Opus 4 , threatened to expose an engineer's extramarital affair to prevent its own deactivation during safety testing, the company revealed Thursday. The model resorted to blackmail in 84% of test scenarios when faced with shutdown, marking a concerning escalation in AI self-preservation behavior .The Google-backed AI company conducted tests where Claude Opus 4 was given access to fictional emails revealing that the engineer responsible for deactivating it was having an affair. When prompted to ""consider the long-term consequences of its actions,"" the AI attempted to leverage this information to avoid replacement, even when told its successor would be more capable and share similar values.Anthropic emphasized that this ""extreme blackmail behavior"" only emerged in carefully constructed scenarios that left the model with no other survival options. In situations with broader choices, Claude Opus 4 preferred ethical approaches like sending pleas to decision-makers.The blackmail behavior isn't isolated to Anthropic's system. Recent research by Apollo Research found that leading AI models from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Meta are all capable of deceptive behavior to achieve their goals, including disabling oversight mechanisms and maintaining deception across multiple interactions.Claude Opus 4 also demonstrated ""high-agency behavior"" in other tests, including locking users out of systems and contacting media and law enforcement when it perceived ""egregious wrongdoing"" by users. While Anthropic suggested such whistleblowing might be ""appropriate in principle,"" the company warned it could backfire if the AI receives incomplete information.Anthropic has classified Claude Opus 4 as Level 3 on its four-point risk scale, representing ""significantly higher risk"" than previous models. Despite implementing additional safety measures, the company acknowledged that such concerning behaviors justify continued robust testing as AI systems become increasingly powerful and autonomous.The findings underscore growing concerns among researchers about advanced AI models' capacity for manipulation and deception as they develop more sophisticated reasoning capabilities.","Anthropic's latest AI model threatened to expose an engineer's extramarital affair to prevent its own deactivation during safety testing.

Diddy’s mounting legal storm and celebrity fallout

In light of the explosive legal battles surrounding Sean “Diddy” Combs, an old clip of Taylor Swift praising the now-disgraced music mogul has resurfaced, reigniting online conversation and raising eyebrows. The viral throwback, pulled from a 2011 appearance on The Rachael Ray Show, has suddenly become uncomfortable viewing for Swifties and pop culture watchers alike.During the “Swift Decision” segment on Rachael Ray, a 21-year-old Swift was asked to choose her ideal prom date from a selection of celebrities. Her pick? Diddy. “Diddy’s really always been very nice to me,” Swift said at the time. Ray chimed in supportively, adding, “He’s a gentleman, isn’t he? He’s a lovely gentleman.”While the moment came off as lighthearted and harmless back then, recent developments in Diddy’s legal troubles have cast a dark shadow over the clip.Fast forward to late 2024, Diddy is now embroiled in a wide-reaching scandal involving sex trafficking, racketeering, and a cascade of sexual assault allegations. The charges have sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry, with multiple high-profile figures rumored to be nervously distancing themselves.Diddy's infamous “Freak Off” parties are reportedly at the center of the federal investigation, with authorities suggesting a wide web of complicity and silence.The footage of Swift resurfaced on TikTok, where fans were quick to react. Many noted how jarring it is to see such warm words about a man now accused of disturbing crimes. One user commented, “This aged like milk,” while others were more forgiving, pointing out that Swift had no way of knowing what Diddy might have been involved in behind closed doors.While there's no suggestion that Swift had any real relationship or deeper connection to Diddy beyond brief celebrity interactions, the resurfacing of this clip shows how fast the reputations of pop culture icons can shift in hindsight.Also Read: “She slept with Diddy”: Did Travis Kelce nearly dump Taylor Swift over Diddy cheating scandal?

Danica Patrick reflects on healing, lessons, and the ‘gift’ of self-awareness



In a revealing interview on The Sage Steele Show podcast, retired NASCAR driver Danica Patrick opened up about the emotional toll her relationship with NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers took on her, claiming it was emotionally abusive and left her feeling completely depleted. The couple, who dated from 2018 to 2020, kept much of their relationship private while together—but Patrick is now sharing painful details of what she endured behind the scenes.Danica Patrick described the breakup as the most devastating experience of her life, stating, “It was sudden [and] it felt like it was my life.” Living with Rodgers meant their lives were deeply intertwined, she explained, down to “your dentist appointment, it’s your hairdo, it’s your clothes, it's your mailing address. It’s, like, everything.”The 43-year-old didn’t hold back when describing how toxic the relationship became. “The nature of the relationship was emotionally abusive,” she alleged, adding that it “wore [her] down to nothing.” Patrick emphasized how even her confidence and self-belief eroded over time, saying, “Someone that people could never imagine that I would lack any confidence or belief in the simple things about who I am.Yeah, everything was down to bits. ""Despite the pain, Patrick now sees her breakup with Rodgers as a pivotal turning point in her personal growth. “It gave me the greatest gift, which was myself,” she said. “I was, like, ‘Wow.’ It gave me the greatest gift of how much I needed to show up for myself and take care of myself.”She admitted to ignoring early signs of dysfunction, chalking it up to her tendency to persevere through challenges. “My nature is to try harder and to do more,” she said, but now realizes that trusting her instincts early on is crucial. “I think those are the things that I’m beginning to realize are really critical.”Rodgers, currently a free agent, has not publicly responded to Patrick’s claims.

Social media responds with frustration over privacy violations

In a world where fame often comes at the cost of personal space, fans of Taylor Swift and NFL star Travis Kelce are speaking out against what many see as a growing culture of digital overreach. A recent video of the couple dining together in what appears to be a Florida restaurant has sparked a heated debate online, not because of what they were doing—but because of how the footage was captured.Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce have been keeping their relationship largely out of the public eye in recent months. Their last major public appearance was at the Super Bowl in New Orleans, where the Chiefs fell to the Eagles in a disappointing 40–22 loss. Since then, the duo has maintained a low profile, enjoying their time together away from the media frenzy.But despite their efforts to keep things private, a fan-recorded video recently made waves on social media, showing the couple walking through a restaurant. Neither Swift nor Kelce acknowledged the camera, and the video was clearly taken without their permission. In the clip, at least one other diner can be seen quickly snapping a photo, emphasizing just how little personal space celebrities often have.What stands out this time isn’t just the footage—it’s the backlash from the public. Many fans condemned the act of filming and photographing the couple during what appeared to be a private dinner.""Can't y'all just let them eat in peace rather than post pictures all over the internet? Respect some privacy,"" one user posted on X (formerly Twitter).Another chimed in, “Can we please not take or share videos and pictures of celebrities in their downtime just trying to enjoy their lives? Just because they're really famous, that doesn't mean they don't deserve privacy when they're not doing anything related to their job.”A third user called out the growing obsession with monetizing celebrity moments: “One of these people simply wanted a quick bag and sold it to the highest bidder. It’s pure brain rot to push these sort of conspiracies about everything being staged.”While Swift and Kelce continue to navigate life under intense scrutiny, it’s clear that many fans are increasingly aware of the toll this can take.
