A hard-hitting account of discrimination and challenges faced by Indian passport holders while travelling internationally, shared by a content creator, has sparked a conversation online.The post was shared by Instagram user @jaystravelblog, who shared a heartfelt note on the silent burden of travelling with an Indian passport. The post begins with “The ugly side of travel I had to come across as an Indian passport holder who loves travelling. It’s not in the guidebooks…It’s in the stares. The silence. The paperwork that makes you prove your humanity”.The creator recounted the emotional toll of having to justify short trips to embassies, often spending more time securing visas than planning the actual journey. “A border control officer, with a 3-second glance, can make me feel like a threat — before I’ve even said a word,” he noted.“Every time I hand over my passport, I also hand over the burden of assumptions,” he wrote, highlighting the constant questions and doubts that accompany travellers from developing countries like India.The account reflected on how rejections are often delivered without explanation, leaving behind feelings of humiliation and helplessness.“We dress a certain way. Speak softer. Carry more documents. Plan escape routes through countries that are ‘easier,’” he wrote, describing the silent strategies employed to navigate bias.Online reactions have poured in support for the user and praised his candid narrative, describing it as a long-overdue conversation. One user wrote, “This is such a needed post! Thank you for writing this. As a fellow travel enthusiast, this hits hard"".The post ends with a message of solidarity. “For every Indian traveller who has felt humiliated, delayed, dismissed — I see you. And I hope someday we don’t have to fight to prove we simply want to explore.”","Instagram user @jaystravelblog shared a heartfelt note on the silent burden of travelling with an Indian passport.

What are 'Kiss Cams'

Who are Andy Byron and Kristin Cabot

A 'Kiss Cam' moment broadcast at a Coldplay concert Astronomer CEO Andy Byron and the firm’s chief human resources officer, Kristin Cabot. While featuring loved-up twosomes during the show, a camera panned over to a man who had his arms wrapped tightly around a woman, according to videos online. As soon as the two realised that they were on camera, the dup scrambled to hide their faces. The man, later identified as Andy Bryon, immediately ducked out of view while the woman, Kristin Cabot , hid her face in apparent embarrassment.Their reaction seems to have puzzled Chris Martin, the lead singer of Coldplay, who jokingly said, ""Oh, look at these two. You're all right. You're OK. Oh, what? Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy.""So what are these ""Kiss Cams"" that outed the tech CEO's affair. 'Kiss Cams' at concerts, like those seen at Coldplay shows, are a popular form of audience engagement and entertainment during breaks or lulls in the main performance. Much like those at sporting events, 'Kiss Cams' are a popular interactive segment designed to entertain the audience during lulls or breaks in the show. A camera operator scans the crowd, displaying random audience members on the large video screens (jumbotrons) in the stadium or arena. When the camera zooms in on a pair, the unspoken expectation is for them to share a kiss, often to the cheers and applause of the crowd.While intended as light-hearted fun and a way to foster communal enjoyment, these moments can sometimes lead to unexpected reactions, ranging from shy giggles to viral, awkward encounters. As seen in recent events, frontman Chris Martin might even playfully comment on the on-screen interactions, adding to the impromptu entertainment. The 'Kiss Cam' serves as a simple yet effective tool to engage thousands of concertgoers, transforming passive spectators into active participants in a memorable moment.As per his LinkedIn profile, Andy Byron has been CEO of Astronomer since July 2023. Before this, he has held senior-level roles at cybersecurity and software companies. The US-based Astronomer is valued at $1 billion. In May 2025, the company announced it has secured $93 million in Series D funding led by Bain Capital Ventures, alongside Salesforce Ventures and existing investors including Insight, Meritech, and Venrock, with Bosch Ventures seeking to participate.Kristin Cabot joined in July 2023, per his LinkedIn profile.

After nearly 12 years since its global debut in 2013, Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) and GTA Online have finally launched in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on July 17, 2025. The launch comes with a newly implemented 21+ age rating, a regulatory milestone that has enabled the full, uncensored version of the game to be released in the Gulf.The official release spans PlayStation 5, Xbox, and PC, both in digital and physical formats. Despite its controversial content, GTA V now enjoys legal status in both countries after years of being available only through imported discs or foreign digital accounts.The official announcement was made via PlayStation Arabia’s X (formerly Twitter) account, which invited players to “experience the ultimate entertainment,” marking a historic moment for Gulf-based fans who have waited more than a decade for a legal release.Though never officially “banned,” GTA V was effectively blocked in Saudi Arabia and the UAE due to strict media regulations around mature content. The main barriers to release included:Even titles like the GTA Trilogy and Red Dead Redemption 2 only gained approval years after their international releases, underlining the slow, case-by-case scrutiny applied to mature games.The turning point in GTA V’s approval came with the introduction of a new 21+ age rating, a global first that is higher than the standard 18+ rating found in most other countries. This classification permits the release of unedited adult content without requiring changes to game mechanics or narratives. Although localized age ratings were first introduced in 2016, they were insufficient to clear GTA V under the previous standards.The upgraded classification was formally approved by Saudi Arabia’s General Authority for Media Regulation (GAMR) and the UAE Media Council following direct consultations with Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive.This release is also tied to a new distribution agreement between Take-Two and Advanced Initiative Company, a Saudi firm that will now serve as the official distributor for all Take-Two titles in the region, including GTA, NBA 2K, WWE 2K, and Red Dead Redemption.The deal not only enabled the long-awaited launch of GTA V but also paves the way for future releases to arrive in the Gulf without the delays that have historically plagued mature-rated titles.No, the game remains largely unaltered. Thanks to the newly introduced 21+ age rating, GTA V has been approved in its full form, including all depictions of violence, firearms, mature language and themes, without any cuts or content modifications. This higher classification was specifically created to allow adult-themed games to pass regulatory scrutiny without being edited, and GTA V is one of the first major titles to benefit from this shift.However, one major exception remains: gambling-related content. Since 2019, all casino features in GTA Online have been explicitly prohibited in Saudi Arabia and the UAE due to religious and legal restrictions on gambling. As a result, the Diamond Casino & Resort, a virtual location within the game where players can engage in betting activities, remains disabled in both countries. Players attempting to access the casino will encounter an in-game message stating that the feature is unavailable in their region.This is consistent with broader policy in the Gulf, where other global games with gambling mechanics, such as card packs, loot boxes, or virtual betting, are also often restricted or adjusted for compliance.

BRUSSELS: In a small, refrigerated room at a Brussels university, parka-wearing scientists chop up Antarctic ice cores tens of thousands of years old in search of clues to our planet's changing climate.Trapped inside the cylindrical icicles are tiny air bubbles that can provide a snapshot of what the earth's atmosphere looked like back then.""We want to know a lot about the climates of the past because we can use it as an analogy for what can happen in the future,"" said Harry Zekollari, a glaciologist at Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB).Zekollari was part of a team of four that headed to the white continent in November on a mission to find some of the world's oldest ice -- without breaking the bank.Ice dating back millions of years can be found deep inside Antarctica, close to the South Pole, buried under kilometres of fresher ice and snow.But that's hard to reach and expeditions to drill it out are expensive.A recent EU-funded mission that brought back some 1.2-million-year-old samples came with a total price tag of around 11 million euros (around $12.8 million).To cut costs, the team from VUB and the nearby Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) used satellite data and other clues to find areas where ancient ice might be more accessible.- Blue ice -Just like the water it is made of, ice flows towards the coast -- albeit slowly, explained Maaike Izeboud, a remote sensing specialist at VUB.And when the flow hits an obstacle, say a ridge or mountain, bottom layers can be pushed up closer to the surface.In a few rare spots, weather conditions like heavy winds prevent the formation of snow cover -- leaving thick layers of ice exposed.Named after their colouration, which contrasts with the whiteness of the rest of the continent, these account for only about one percent of Antarctica territory.""Blue ice areas are very special,"" said Izeboud.Her team zeroed in on a blue ice stretch lying about 2,300 meters (7,500 feet) above sea level, around 60 kilometres (37 miles) from Belgium's Princess Elisabeth Antarctica Research Station.Some old meteorites had been previously found there -- a hint that the surrounding ice is also old, the researchers explained.A container camp was set up and after a few weeks of measurements, drilling, and frozen meals, in January the team came back with 15 ice cores totalling about 60 meters in length.These were then shipped from South Africa to Belgium, where they arrived in late June.Inside a stocky cement ULB building in the Belgian capital, they are now being cut into smaller pieces to then be shipped to specialised labs in France and China for dating.Zekollari said the team hopes some of the samples, which were taken at shallow depths of about 10 meters, will be confirmed to be about 100,000 years old.- Climate 'treasure hunt' -This would allow them to go back and dig a few hundred meters deeper in the same spot for the big prize.""It's like a treasure hunt,"" Zekollari, 36, said, comparing their work to drawing a map for ""Indiana Jones"".""We're trying to cross the good spot on the map... and in one and a half years, we'll go back and we'll drill there,"" he said.""We're dreaming a bit, but we hope to get maybe three, four, five-million-year-old ice.""Such ice could provide crucial input to climatologists studying the effects of global warming Climate projections and models are calibrated using existing data on past temperatures and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere -- but the puzzle has some missing pieces.By the end of the century temperatures could reach levels similar to those the planet last experienced between 2.6 and 3.3 million years ago, said Etienne Legrain, 29, a paleo-climatologist at ULB.But currently there is little data on what CO2 levels were back then -- a key metric to understand how much further warming we could expect.""We don't know the link between CO2 concentration and temperature in a climate warmer than that of today,"" Legrain said.His team hopes to find it trapped inside some very old ice.

A restaurant in northern China has sparked outrage after offering customers the chance to cuddle lion cubs while enjoying afternoon tea.Animal welfare groups and social media users are slamming the experience as exploitative and dangerous.The Wanhui restaurant is situated in Taiyuan City in Shanxi province. It allows guests to handle the young lions as part of a four-course tea set, priced at 1,078 yuan ($150). Since opening in June, the venue has been selling around 20 tickets daily for the experience, which also features other animals such as llamas, deer, and turtles. Videos and photos of customers cradling the lion cubs have gone viral on Chinese social media platforms like WeChat and Weibo.Animal rights advocates have condemned the practice, warning of both ethical and safety concerns. “Tearing lion cubs from their mothers so diners can handle them over afternoon tea is exploitation, not entertainment. These animals are living, feeling beings, not toys,” Jason Baker, Senior vice president at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), told news agency Reuters.Baker also criticised the trend of using animals for viral content, adding, “The animals were treated like nothing more than social media props.”Peter Li, a policy expert on China for Humane World for Animals, also raised concerns about the risks involved. “Exploiting wild animals for selfies and marketing gimmicks is not only appallingly bad animal welfare, it's also potentially risky for customers,” he was quoted as saying to Reuters. “Even a young lion is capable of lashing out and injuring a human. So, treating wild animals like props is both morally unacceptable and dangerously irresponsible. ”Despite the backlash, the restaurant has defended itself, claiming the cubs are in good health and under professional care. “They were taken care of very well, with specialised carers to tend to them,” a representative told Reuters.This incident follows another controversial hospitality service in China last month, when authorities launched an investigation into a hotel in Chongqing for its so-called “wake-up service” using red pandas. The animals were allowed to climb onto guests’ beds to rouse them in the mornings, drawing similar criticism from animal rights groups.",The Wanhui restaurant is situated in Taiyuan City in Shanxi province.

Sharjah is taking steps to bring more visitors to its mountain areas during the cooler months. The new road project announced by the ruler, Sheikh Dr Sultan bin Mohamed Al Qasimi, will connect the city of Khorfakkan to its highest mountain peak, offering travelers an escape from the usual heat of the UAE.This isn’t just about building a road. It’s about creating a new kind of journey that blends nature, culture, and comfort, especially during winter, when the mountain climate is mild and inviting. The road will wind over hills and peaks, surrounded by trees, water channels, and small homes, making it a peaceful and scenic drive.Winter tourism means visitors look for places where the weather is pleasant and outdoor activities are possible without the harsh sun or extreme heat. Khorfakkan’s mountain peak stands at 1,100 meters, which means temperatures here are cooler than the coastal city below.The new road takes advantage of this by offering a travel route where people can enjoy fresh air, green scenery, and calm surroundings. Unlike crowded city spots or busy beaches, this mountain road promises a quieter experience. The trees and plantations planted along the way will add to the feeling of being in nature, making it ideal for winter visitors who want to relax or explore.The plan is to turn a simple highway into a tourist-friendly route.

These communities often don’t get much attention, but better road access could bring them new visitors and help their economies. Small businesses like cafes, craft shops, or guided tours could benefit from this.This mountain road fits well with Sharjah’s bigger vision for the region. Khorfakkan has been gaining recognition as a cultural and eco-tourism hub. For example, the nearby Faya Palaeolandscape was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List earlier this month, drawing attention to the area’s unique natural and historical value.The new road will make it easier for tourists to reach these sites and enjoy what Khorfakkan offers beyond its coastlines. Walking trails are also being built in the city to encourage tourists to explore on foot.On top of this, other projects are planned nearby in Jabal Deem, including parks, farms, and rest stops, which will add to the overall tourist experience in the mountains.

FAQs

Q1: Why is Dubai labeling AI content?

Q2: How is AI being used in UAE health services?

Q3: Will AI replace government leaders in the UAE?





Dubai just became the first city in the world to roll out a formal system that tells you whether content was made by a human, a machine, or both. It’s not just a label, it’s a new way of thinking about transparency in the digital age. But this is only one piece of a much bigger picture.Across the UAE, artificial intelligence is quietly becoming part of daily life. It’s helping design cycling helmets, manage traffic, assist in government decisions, and even plan your dinner. Unlike many countries that are still debating the risks of AI, the UAE is putting it to work in clear, controlled, and sometimes surprising ways.From a content labeling system to smart parking meters, here’s how the UAE is building one of the most AI-integrated societies in the world.On July 16, Dubai introduced the Human-Machine Collaboration Icons, a global-first system that shows who or what, made a piece of content. There are five main icons, each showing a different level of human and machine involvement. These range from “All Human” to “All Machine.”There are also nine additional tags that show where in the process the machine stepped in, things like data collection, writing, or visual design.What’s important here isn’t just the icons, it’s the message. This is Dubai saying: if machines are part of your creative process, be upfront about it.Not just this innovation, let’s take a quick look at some of the recent AI developments across the UAE that show how the country is bringing artificial intelligence into many parts of daily life.At this year’s Tour de France, the UAE Team Emirates–XRG debuted a cycling helmet made using generative AI. The helmet wasn’t just designed for looks. AI helped map airflow and friction, making the helmet lighter and faster. This came out of a collaboration between Abu Dhabi-based G42 and Italian helmet maker MET.In Abu Dhabi, a new AI-powered parking system means no more worrying about tickets or meters. Cameras and smart sensors track car movements, manage payments automatically, and help drivers find spots in real time. It’s faster, easier, and requires no physical interaction.Starting 2026, the UAE will add an AI advisory system to its federal cabinet. This isn’t science fiction. The AI won’t vote, but it will give data-backed advice, predict outcomes, and help fine-tune decisions. It's a move to bring speed and precision into government thinking.Dubai’s healthcare system is moving towards prevention. A new WhatsApp-based platform now lets people check their health risks from home. AI tools are monitoring heart rate, stress levels, and other indicators spotting issues early before symptoms appear. The Ministry of Health is also using virtual assistants and biometric tracking for wide-scale screening.Opening soon in Dubai: a restaurant where the menu is designed by AI. “Chef Aiman” isn’t human, but it’s trained in food science, sustainability, and global cuisines. Human chefs still do the cooking, but the AI handles creativity, pairing, and planning.What’s different about the UAE’s approach is the quiet, steady rollout. Instead of flashy promises or hypothetical demos, they’re putting AI into real places, helmets, traffic lights, chat apps, menus.There’s also a strong focus on structure and transparency. Systems like the content classification icons show that the country wants AI to be understandable, not just useful.To make it clear whether content is made by people, machines, or both. It helps build trust and prevents confusion.Through WhatsApp-based risk checks, virtual AI assistants, and biometric tools that monitor heart rate, stress, and more.No. The AI will act as an advisor, offering quick data analysis and feedback to help improve decisions.","Dubai launched a world-first system to label human vs AI-generated content.

As the country prepares to mark its 54th National Day, plans for this year’sare already in motion. The reminder came on July 18, known as Union Pledge Day, a date that honors the moment when the UAE’s foundation was first laid.Back in 1971, a group of leaders, led by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, signed an agreement that changed the future of the region. That document, known as the Declaration of the Union, along with the newly drafted UAE Constitution, set the stage for what would officially become the United Arab Emirates later that year, on December 2.Since then, National Day has grown into something more than a holiday.

"Speed trap backlash: Brampton’s roads flooded with 185 surveillance cameras; drivers say ‘we’re human, not machines’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/speed-trap-backlash-bramptons-roads-flooded-with-185-surveillance-cameras-drivers-say-were-human-not-machines/articleshow/122627960.cms,"Representative image





Some Ontario drivers are voicing growing frustration over the widespread use of speed cameras, as a new petition gains momentum in Brampton calling for their removal.With 185 automated speed enforcement (ASE) cameras set to be active across Brampton by the end of the summer, critics say the system is turning roads into zones of constant surveillance, reports Inside Halton.“In the midst of an affordability crisis, inflation, rising taxes and economic pressure, families cannot afford to have their hard-earned money siphoned through automated ticketing systems,” wrote Carolina Cutruzzola in a Change.org petition demanding the cameras be abolished. “These cameras disproportionately impact working class individuals, many of whom are just trying to commute safely, efficiently and peacefully. ”The petition, signed by more than 4,100 people as of July 14, accuses the authorities of removing the human element of policing and replacing it with what Cutruzzola called “cold, impersonal technology.” She argued that drivers are under pressure and said: “We are human. We are not perfect. We are not machines.”Ontario first authorised the use of ASE cameras in 2017 to improve road safety in school and community zones where speed limits are under 80 km/h.The province says the goal is to reduce collisions and protect vulnerable pedestrians, but the cameras are controlled entirely by municipalities.Speed camera enforcement has been controversial in cities across Ontario. In Toronto, a camera on Parkside Drive was cut down for the sixth time since November, even after another surveillance camera was installed to catch vandals. In Vaughan, the programme was paused after it issued over 32,000 tickets in just three weeks.The fines, especially in designated community safety zones, can be steep. A ticket for going 10 km/h over the limit in such areas is $68.25, but municipalities often do not disclose whether any grace is given before issuing tickets. “Speed limits are not guidelines — they are the law,” the City of Vaughan noted.Ticket recipients often receive notice weeks later by post, and fighting them in court is difficult. There is no interaction with police, and the photo evidence includes the vehicle, time, location and speed. However, the tickets do not affect driving records or insurance, unless the driver operates a commercial vehicle.While the province says the ASE framework is meant to promote safety, critics argue it’s creating anxiety and raising money off working-class commuters. Some municipalities, like York Region, have brought in over $11.5 million since launching their programmes, raising questions about the role of revenue in the use of speed cameras.","185 automated speed enforcement (ASE) cameras set to be active across Brampton by the end of the summer.

A 1.2-kilometre indoor running track for cardio training without braving the outdoor heat.

No Formalities, Sheikh Mansour Played the Game



A Broader Pattern in UAE Leadership







In the UAE, where extreme summer heat often limits outdoor activity, the response has been practical and purpose-driven. Initiatives like Abu Dhabi Summer Sports (ADSS) are turning indoor spaces into large-scale, accessible venues for sport and wellbeing. It’s part of a wider national effort, led by figures known for their visible, hands-on approach, to keep the country active, engaged, and connected year-round.That approach was clearly on display during a recent visit to the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC), where the event is being held. His Highness Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Vice President of the UAE, Deputy Prime Minister, and Chairman of the Presidential Court, attended in an active capacity, engaging with organisers, reviewing the venue's facilities, and joining participants in a casual volleyball match.The Abu Dhabi Summer Sports (ADSS) event is a large-scale indoor initiative aimed at encouraging people of all ages to stay active, fit, and healthy throughout the UAE’s hottest months. Organised by the ADNEC Group in partnership with the Abu Dhabi Sports Council, the event brings together a wide range of sports and activities under one roof in a safe, climate-controlled environment.ADSS is built with both scale and purpose. Hosted at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC), the venue spans more than 37,000 square metres, making it one of the largest indoor sports activations in the region. Its infrastructure includes:t one of the largest indoor sports activations in the region. Its infrastructure includes:What makes the event stand out isn’t just the size but how it’s designed to serve everyone, not just trained athletes or sports clubs.Families, children, casual fitness lovers, and amateurs all have dedicated zones. From kid-friendly setups to structured games parents can join, the environment is curated to encourage shared experiences and long-term engagement in physical wellness.Sheikh Mansour was briefed by organisers on all aspects of the event: the design logic, activity zones, safety measures, and objectives behind the initiative. That includes the strategic aim of sustaining community-wide physical activity during a season where most people typically avoid it.What set this visit apart was not the speeches or the staging, it was the simplicity of it. After his tour, Sheikh Mansour joined a friendly volleyball match, playing alongside everyday participants. No grand announcement, no tightly choreographed ceremony, just a real game, in real time, among the people.This direct involvement aligned with the broader goals of the Abu Dhabi Summer Sports (ADSS) initiative: encouraging people across age groups and skill levels to take part in regular physical activity, even during the peak of summer.Following the visit, Sheikh Mansour commended the overall organisation, noting the event’s accessibility, safety standards, and capacity to host a wide variety of sports. He highlighted its value in promoting community health, supporting active lifestyles, and providing well-equipped, climate-controlled spaces for year-round sport.Sheikh Mansour’s participation fits into a larger national narrative, one where sport and wellness are not just government-supported, but culturally encouraged. Leaders across the Emirates frequently show up at local sports events, and many of them are athletes themselves.A notable example of leadership-driven fitness culture is Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, widely known as Fazza. He is an accomplished endurance rider with numerous international titles and pursues activities like skydiving, scuba diving, and flyboarding. Through his active presence on Instagram, Sheikh Hamdan makes fitness a visible, aspirational part of leadership, inspiring younger generations to embrace an active lifestyle.","Abu Dhabi Summer Sports is a large-scale, climate-controlled event promoting fitness for all ages through over 12 sports and family activities.

Starting June 30, 2025, residents of the UAE who plan to travel to China must follow a revamped, two-step visa application process that combines an online review with an in-person submission. This new system, launched by the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Abu Dhabi and subsequently adopted by the Consulate General in Dubai, aims to simplify the application process, reduce paperwork, and speed up initial reviews, marking a significant shift from the previous, more cumbersome procedure.The key change under the new system is that applicants would no longer have to walk into the Chinese Visa Application Service Centre (CVASC) directly to submit their visa application. Instead, the process begins online:The previous visa application method required applicants to download, print, and manually fill up lengthy PDF forms, often causing confusion and delays. It also involved booking appointments to visit the visa centre, submitting paper documents, and generally longer processing times.The new system offers:The updated application platform caters to several visa categories, each with specific requirements:The Embassy of China in Abu Dhabi launched this digital platform on June 30, 2025, followed by the Dubai consulate on July 14, 2025.

A Call for Global Adoption







In a groundbreaking move that could reshape the way the world evaluates creative and scientific output, His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Dubai Future Foundation, has announced the launch of a first-of-its-kind global classification system. The initiative, called the, aims to clearly differentiate between human and machine contributions in the research, production, and publication of creative, academic, scientific, and intellectual content.As reported by the Emirates News Agency (WAM), Sheikh Hamdan emphasized the urgency of this step in light of the rapidly evolving role of artificial intelligence (AI):“Distinguishing between human creativity and artificial intelligence has become a real challenge in light of today’s rapid technological advances. This calls for a new approach to recognise the growing role of intelligent machines. That’s why we launched the world’s first Human–Machine Collaboration Icons, a classification system that brings transparency to how research documents, publications, and content are created. ”This new system is not just theoretical, it is being implemented immediately across Dubai’s government. Sheikh Hamdan has directed all Dubai Government entities to adopt the classification in their research and knowledge-based projects.The HMC classification system, developed by the Dubai Future Foundation, offers a practical and visually accessible way for readers, researchers, and decision-makers to understand the extent of AI involvement in content creation. The classification introduces five core icons that indicate the level of collaboration between humans and intelligent machines:This approach is designed to inject clarity into a domain where AI use often goes undisclosed. In today’s digital landscape, where tools like generative AI, automation systems, and intelligent algorithms increasingly shape content, it’s often difficult for consumers or collaborators to understand how much of the work was created by a human or a machine.The termin this context covers a broad range of technologies: from AI and automation tools to robotics and algorithms, or any digital system that plays a role in the research, design, writing, analysis, or presentation of information.The HMC system goes beyond top-level labels by introducing nine functional icons that show where, in the content creation process, human–machine collaboration took place. These icons are especially relevant to common research workflows and publication tasks, helping identify exactly how machines were involved.As a foundation, the classification system reflects key stages that typically involve machine assistance in research and content production. These include:For instance, a research paper may be marked “Machine Assisted” with functional icons indicating AI helped in data analysis and visuals, but ideation and writing were entirely human-led. This enables a more nuanced and transparent evaluation, providing valuable insight not only into thebut theof content creation.Importantly, the system does not attempt to assign numeric percentages or weights to the machine's contribution, acknowledging that these judgments can often be subjective. Instead, it empowers creators to be honest and transparent about the involvement of machines, providing audiences with the information they need to evaluate authenticity and integrity.Sheikh Hamdan's announcement is more than a local policy, it’s a global invitation.“We invite researchers, writers, publishers, designers, and content creators around the world to adopt this new global classification system and use it responsibly and in ways that benefit people,” he stated.This marks more than just a response to rapid technological change, it’s a clear signal that Dubai wants to shape how the world works with AI, not just adapt to it. As intelligent machines become more deeply involved in how we create and communicate, the line between human input and machine output continue to blur. The HMC Icons are meant to bring that line back into focus, not to hold innovation back, but to make sure people know what they’re looking at, and can trust what they’re reading or watching.By launching this system, Dubai is taking a leadership role in shaping ethical AI use and setting new standards for content transparency. The classification model is built to be adaptable across multiple sectors, such as academia, design, video production, and software development, where AI is increasingly integrated into everyday workflows. At its core, the system promotes honest disclosure of machine involvement, encouraging creators and institutions to uphold integrity by clearly showing how content is produced.By normalizing transparency, it may also reshape how AI involvement is perceived, less as a hidden shortcut and more as a declared, deliberate part of the creative and research process.","Dubai launched a global system to label human vs. AI roles in content creation.

Humans and Hallucinating AI: Not So Different



The Extraplation Problem







The Betteridge’s Law of Headings state that whenever the heading of an article begins with a question, the answer to that is ‘No’. It’s a fairly accurate law, but in this case, things are a tad more complicated because we are dealing with the most famous underwear model in the world.Superman has always meant different things to different people. Created by Jewish artists, many saw him as Moses — a baby sent away from a dying world, being raised by strangers who will lead people to the promised land by performing miracles. Some saw him as a Messiah with a better workout routine — misunderstood, crucified, and yet still willing to forgive. He’s an immigrant made good, an Einstein or Elon Musk becoming something the world has never seen. For Sheldon Cooper, he’s a physics problem — because the science clearly shows that being ‘saved’ by Superman would be a grislier death than being crushed under a building. And to those with a philosophical bent, Superman is the flipside of a Nietzschean Übermensch, a being beyond humanity who can destroy everything with the blink of an eye.Given that Superman has always been the ultimate blank canvas to project one’s worldview, it’s hardly surprising that those of the progressive persuasion — tapped into the gateway drug of global liberalism — saw the new James Gunn Superman movie as an allegory of the Israel-Palestine conflict, despite the fact that there wasn’t a single paraglider in the movie, though there were some underground tunnels in a different dimension.Those on the opposite side — who believe the IDF only hands out candies — claimed it was antisemitic propaganda. Whether you see resistance or slander — truth to power or libel with a cape — depends less on the film itself, and more on what’s already in your head. Or to be very specific, how you perceive the world — a specific sort of meta-bias that one likes to call the Extrapolation Bias.The delusion that one thing explains everything. It’s when someone sees a shoplifting video and concludes an entire culture is corrupt, or watches a superhero movie and decides it’s anti-Israel propaganda. It sees a CEO on a Coldplay Kiss Cam and assumes everyone in tech is cheating. Or reads one story about a husband being murdered and assumes Macbeth-style murders are the natural conclusion of any nuptials. A meta-bias where one’s brain takes one bit of data and decides to use it to explain everything.It’s the Captain Planet of cognitive distortions — summoned whenandjoin forces.It’s the mind’s lazy cognitive shortcut where one instance becomes an example of a pattern and ergo proof of how society is functioning. You're not analysing — you're projecting, pattern-hunting, and storytelling your way into a worldview that feels right, even if it has no resemblance to reality.Superman intervenes in a clash between protesters and a heavily armed military in a fictional country, and you immediately think, “This is Gaza.”That’s— you already believed Hollywood pushes a particular narrative.You see civilians waving flags and facing down riot shields, and because Gaza is flooding your feed, your brain fills in the blanks.That’s theOne reviewer calls it “woke anti-Israel propaganda,” and suddenly you’re spotting clues everywhere — in symbols, dialogue, colour palettes.That’s the(frequency illusion).The general in charge wears a grey uniform and deploys sleek drones — so now you’re convinced he’s a Netanyahu stand-in.That’sAnd finally, you take all the imagery — tunnels, surveillance, power imbalance, civilian resistance — and construct a sweeping political allegory.That’sPut them all together and you have extrapolation bias. One event. One film. One frame of video. And suddenly, you're rewriting your worldview — or reinforcing it with a smug tweet and a three-paragraph Instagram caption.Because it’s easier. We live in a world too complex to fully understand, and our brains are hardwired for survival, not nuance. So we generalise. We assume. We label. We extrapolate. Because certainty feels safer than ambiguity. And extrapolation bias is fast. It feels like a shortcut to truth. It feels like pattern recognition. It feels like insight. But it’s not. It’s your brain doing what large language models do — hallucinating meaning based on prior inputs. You saw a few patterns, you filled in the blanks, and you’re convinced you’ve uncovered a conspiracy. Just like ChatGPT filling in a bibliography with fake academic sources, you’ve built a worldview based on vibes and pattern-matching.This is where it gets uncomfortable.Last week, we explained why Mechahitler and Black George Washington are real — not in the literal sense, but in the way our brains insist on pattern, myth, and meaning. This week, we turn the mirror around. Because the way extrapolation bias works isn’t so different from how LLMs — large language models — hallucinate.Both are predictive machines.Both rely on prior data.Both fill in the blanks with what feels right.Both prioritise coherence over truth.The difference? LLMs admit when they’re guessing. Humans, less so.An LLM guesses because that’s what it’s trained to do. You guess because that’s what your brain evolved to do — take limited data and spin it into a survival narrative. Or, in 2025, a thread. We hallucinate meaning. They hallucinate syntax. Neither is rooted in grounded fact. But both are scarily confident.But as a statistically-inclined friend and colleague pointed out, the human condition is extrapolation bias — where we try to make sense of the madness based on the data available to us. DRS is extrapolating where the ball will go. Doctors are extrapolating how to prevent a disease. Movie studios are extrapolating how audiences will react. And even citizens in a democracy are extrapolating how a politician will serve them better. The problem isn’t that we extrapolate. The problem is when we do it lazily. When we confuse anecdote for data. When we treat every incident as evidence. When we stop asking: is this representative, or just resonant? Because sometimes a shoplifting video is just a crime. And a Superman movie is just about aliens in spandex — not an encrypted UN resolution. Your worldview might be valid. But maybe — just maybe — not everything is about you.Not even Superman. And definitely not James Gunn",The Extrapolation Bias is the delusion that one thing explains everything. It’s when someone sees a shoplifting video and concludes an entire culture is corrupt. It sees a CEO on a Coldplay Kiss Cam and assumes everyone in tech is cheating. Or reads one story about a husband being murdered and assumes Macbeth- style murders are the natural conclusion of any nuptials.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122767137,imgsize-207730,width-400,resizemode-4/122767137.jpg"

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Speaking in a Thursday interview with Matthew Berman, Srinivas urged people to ""spend less time doomscrolling on Instagram; spend more time using the AIs.""The CEO warned that those who fail to adapt to AI technology will be left behind in the job market . ""People who really are at the frontier of using AIs are going to be way more employable than people who are not,"" Srinivas said. ""That's guaranteed to happen.""Srinivas acknowledged that keeping pace with rapidly evolving AI technology poses significant challenges for most people. ""Human race has never been extremely fast at adapting,"" he said, noting that AI technology evolves every three to six months, testing ""the limits in terms of how fast we can adapt.""The Perplexity chief predicted that some workers will inevitably lose their jobs due to their inability to keep up with AI advances. However, he sees entrepreneurship as the solution to potential job displacement.As AI reduces headcounts across industries, Srinivas believes new employment opportunities must come from entrepreneurs rather than traditional companies. ""Either the other people who lose jobs end up starting companies themselves and make use of AIs, or they end up learning the AIs and contribute to new companies,"" he explained.His comments align with broader industry concerns about AI's impact on employment. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently predicted AI could eliminate 50% of white-collar entry-level positions within five years, while AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton warned that artificial intelligence will replace workers in ""mundane intellectual labor."" However, other tech leaders like Nvidia's Jensen Huang take a more optimistic view, suggesting AI will transform rather than eliminate jobs entirely.","Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas urges young people to focus on mastering artificial intelligence tools instead of social media. He acknowledges the challenges of adapting to rapidly evolving AI technology, which changes every three to six months.

YouTube new monetisation rules: Why the 2025 policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety, accountability, and protecting minors from online harassment, inappropriate content, live chat abuse, privacy violations, and potential exploitation during livestreams.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue.
