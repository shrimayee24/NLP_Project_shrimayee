A comeback rooted in authenticity and quiet strength

Post-baby glow with purpose and presence





Supermodel Gisele Bündchen is back in front of the camera, and her return is nothing short of breathtaking. Just three months after welcoming her third child — her first with boyfriend Joaquim Valente — the 44-year-old icon is redefining postpartum beauty and proving that motherhood can be just as radiant as any runway moment.For the June/July 2025 issue of Vogue France, Gisele Bündchen collaborated with legendary photographer Mario Sorrenti in a dreamy editorial that blends ethereal fashion with emotional resonance. Draped in sheer lace gowns reminiscent of both Victorian elegance and forest fairy-tale magic, Gisele channels serenity, power, and femininity in every frame. It's a stark contrast to the high-drama fashion editorials of old, offering a softer, soul-rich vision of beauty.These images, which she described as part of a broader wellness message, aren't just about style — they're about presence. “To me, wellness goes far beyond physical health. It’s not just about what you eat or how you move, it’s also about how you feel, think, and live,” Bündchen shared on Instagram. “It’s in your thoughts, your habits, the boundaries you honor, and the inner peace you protect. True wellness is about embracing, honoring, and nourishing every part of who you are.This isn’t just a return to modeling for Gisele — it’s a reintroduction of the woman she’s become. After years devoted to raising her children with ex-husband Tom Brady, as well as helping co-parent his eldest, Bündchen’s latest chapter is one of empowerment and earned peace.“I feel more comfortable in my own skin and have a clearer understanding of my priorities,” she told Vogue France. “I’m grateful for where I am. I feel like I’ve earned it.”Even the glamour of hair and makeup felt like a personal reward. “Having my hair and make-up done makes me feel like I’m on vacation,” she joked, revealing that in the early weeks with her newborn, she “hardly brushed [her] hair.”With her baby boy — whose middle name is reportedly River — now sleeping through the night, Gisele says she’s finally regaining her rhythm. On Mother’s Day, she shared a glimpse of her “little angel” and opened up about “embracing the slower rhythms” of life.Also Read: “It was tough”: Tom Brady admits parental failures after public humiliation and split from Gisele Bündchen Whether she's wading through coastal waters or redefining wellness, Gisele Bündchen’s return is a powerful reminder that beauty, strength, and self-love don’t fade — they evolve.",Gisele Bündchen is back in front of the camera for Vogue France.

Bengals and Trey Hendrickson locked in contract war that could shatter Cincinnati’s defense,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/bengals-and-trey-hendrickson-locked-in-contract-war-that-could-shatter-cincinnatis-defense/articleshow/121580365.cms,"Trey Hendrickson’s contract standoff puts Bengals’ 2025 defense on edge (Image via: Getty Images)

Trey Hendrickson contract standoff threatening Cincinnati’s defensive strength







Trey Hendrickson contract dispute with the Cincinnati Bengals has become a major NFL story, dragging on for months with no resolution in sight. As tensions escalate, both sides remain firm, leaving fans to wonder when the stalemate will end. This ongoing battle could seriously affect Hendrickson’s future and the Bengals’ defense heading into the crucial 2025 season.Since last year, the Bengals and Hendrickson have been locked in an increasingly ugly negotiation, with no clear sign of progress. This isn’t your typical holdout or quiet contract dispute. Hendrickson, a four-time Pro Bowler and arguably the NFL’s premier edge rusher over the past two seasons, has openly criticized the Bengals for their lack of communication and transparency. His frustration spilled over into public statements, underscoring how personal the matter has become.Hendrickson’s stance is firm: he refuses to play under his current contract, which many view as a slap given his league-leading sack totals in 2024. The Bengals’ offer, reportedly around $28 million per year, falls well short of the market value for a player of his caliber—especially when compared to stars like Maxx Crosby, who earns $35.5 million annually, and Myles Garrett at $40 million.This chasm in expectations has led to increasingly harsh actions, including the Bengals threatening fines if Hendrickson doesn’t attend the mandatory minicamp in June. Rather than encouraging cooperation, the letter only deepened the rift, with Hendrickson calling out the move as a clear sign the Bengals do not intend to resolve the issue anytime soon.Insiders, like Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer, believe the upcoming mandatory minicamp, scheduled for June 10-12 could force a breakthrough or at least create some urgency. But given the current frostiness, it’s more likely to be a flashpoint than a resolution.Also Read: Elijah Moore praises Buffalo’s support and Josh Allen’s leadership amid Bills’ receiver overhaul While trading Hendrickson might seem like a drastic and short-sighted decision, the widening gulf and deteriorating relationship leave few alternatives. Losing Hendrickson would be a severe blow to Cincinnati’s pass rush and defensive identity, especially with the 2025 season approaching.","Trey Hendrickson's contract dispute with the Cincinnati Bengals has become a major NFL story.

Apple is all set to host its annual developer conference — WWDC 2025 next week. At the event the company is expected to unveil the latest versions of its iOS, iPadOS and macOS operating systems. Now a new report suggests that Apple may name the upcoming version of macOS as macOS Tahoe . As reported by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple’s upcoming macOS 26 is said to be named macOS Tahoe. The name follows Apple’s tradition of using California landmarks for macOS branding, with Lake Tahoe chosen to represent the new design overhaul expected in this release.Apple traditionally names its macOS operating systems after iconic California landmarks, a practice that has led to names like macOS Ventura, Monterey, Big Sur, and Catalina in recent years. Lake Tahoe, known for its clear waters and mountain reflections, aligns with Apple’s rumoured glass-like, translucent UI redesign.

Lake Tahoe, a large freshwater lake in the Sierra Nevada mountains, fits this naming convention perfectly.Alongside macOS Tahoe, Apple is reportedly rebranding all its operating systems to match the calendar year.

Nothing is preparing to launch its next smartphone – Nothing Phone 3 next month. According to industry sources and company teasers, the phone is expected to bring design refinements and upgraded performance. While an exact launch date is yet to be confirmed, leaks and renders suggest Nothing Phone 3 will stick to the transparent rear design. However, subtle changes in the layout of internal components and LED glyph interface may offer a more polished look.In terms of performance, Nothing Phone 3 is expected to run on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8-series chip. The smartphone is teased to offer a significant upgrade from the Phone 2’s Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1. Users can also expect improved camera hardware and AI-based software features, aimed at enhancing mobile photography and video.Nothing is also rumored to remove its Glyph Interface — the rear LED notification system. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Nothing shared a short video clip with the caption, “We killed the Glyph Interface.” The cryptic message has sparked speculation that the company may be overhauling or replacing the signature Glyph Interface—a key design feature of its previous smartphones—as part of its upcoming Nothing Phone 3 launch.The phone will likely run on Nothing OS 3.0 , based on Android 15, featuring a cleaner interface and better battery optimization. The handset is expected to have a 6.77-inch AMOLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate. Nothing Phone 3 could house a 5,000mAh battery.Last month, during The Android Show: I/O Edition, Nothing co-founder Carl Pei hinted that the upcoming Nothing Phone 3 could be priced around GBP 800 (approximately Rs 90,000).

LinkedIn lays off hundreds of employees across California: Engineers and others affected



iPhone 16e: 5 Reasons to buy the most affordable iPhone 16 series model!

LinkedIn is laying off 281 employees across California, impacting engineers and other units, a report claims. The Microsoft-owned professional networking platform has notified affected workers earlier, a WARN document filed with local officials claims. The job cuts are reportedly distributed across several locations: 159 positions in Mountain View, 60 in San Francisco, 23 in Sunnyvale, 11 in Carpinteria, and 28 remote workers based in California. These layoffs seem to be a part of a larger wave of job reductions at parent company Microsoft. Earlier this month, it was reported that 122 Bay Area Microsoft employees were laid off as part of an estimated 6,000-employee cut across the tech giant. In April, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also stated that artificial intelligence (AI) was responsible for writing up to 30% of the company's code, which may be the reason behind these job cuts.According to the WARN filing (seen by SF Gate), LinkedIn has laid off a significant number of software engineers. In Mountain View alone, 71 positions across three broad categories of software engineers, including those with “staff” and “senior” in their titles, are being eliminated.This count doesn’t include additional specialists in areas like machine learning, DevOps, and systems infrastructure, some of whom are also affected, the report notes. The filing further lists roles such as deal desk strategists, product managers, designers, and various other professionals among those impacted.However, the report didn’t reveal details about the full extent of the layoffs announced by the company, which is headquartered on the border of Sunnyvale and Mountain View with several other offices worldwide.LinkedIn and its parent company, Microsoft, have yet to respond to inquiries regarding the reasons behind the job cuts, details about severance packages, or whether more layoffs are anticipated.In 2023, when the company laid off 716 employees, LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky addressed the decision in a publicly shared email. So far, no such communication has been released this time.

Could you own one?





A simple penny you’ve overlooked could be worth a life-changing amount. One rare 2001-D Lincoln cent has made waves in the numismatic world for an extraordinary reason: a minting error that combines the front of a penny with the back of a dime. This so-called “mule error” coin, produced at the Denver Mint, has sold for over $100,000 at auction. While it looks like an ordinary penny on one side, flipping it over reveals a design never meant to be there. If you have one, even in poor shape, it could still be worth tens of thousands.The 2001-D Lincoln cent mule error is a result of a rare mistake at the Denver Mint. While the front (obverse) of the coin features the usual portrait of Abraham Lincoln, the reverse side is where things take a surprising turn: instead of the Lincoln Memorial, it shows the reverse of a Roosevelt dime. This unexpected pairing of obverse and reverse designs is called a ""mule"" error—an accidental blend of two different coins.Only a handful of these coins are known to exist, making them incredibly rare. Experts believe fewer than 10 may have ever entered circulation. Because of this rarity, they’ve become highly valuable in the collector market. Even damaged or worn versions of this coin could sell for $20,000 or more.Four of these rare coins have already made headlines with their auction results:These figures reflect the coin’s growing demand and scarcity, especially among error coin collectors.Because these coins were unintentionally released into circulation, it’s possible—though extremely unlikely—that one could still be found in everyday pocket change. The key is to look for a 2001 penny with a ""D"" mint mark (for Denver) on the front, and then check the reverse. If it shows the torch, olive branch, and oak branch design found on a Roosevelt dime instead of the Lincoln Memorial, you may have something special.While the odds of finding this mint error are slim, it’s a reminder of how even small mistakes can create big value in the world of numismatics. So next time you empty your wallet, take a moment to inspect your coins—you might just be holding a $100,000 treasure.","The 2001-D Lincoln cent mule error is a result of a rare mistake at the Denver Mint.

Xi Mingze’s fake image that fooled everyone



Why the image looked credible



The red flags and the investigation



The real identity behind “Xi Mingze”



How the misidentification happened

The consequences of misidentification





An image purporting to show Xi Mingze, the reclusive daughter of Chinese President Xi Jinping, walking a red carpet at a UN fashion event has circulated widely online, even appearing in reputable outlets like Newsweek and The Times. At first glance, the story seemed plausible. However, a detailed investigation by X user @echetus revealed the photo was a case of mistaken identity. The resulting inquiry exposed sloppy media verification and the dangers of blindly trusting image agencies. Here’s how the story unravelled—and what it says about journalism in the digital age.The photograph was taken at the 2018 “Fashion 4 Development” First Lady’s Luncheon in New York, a high-profile UN-backed event attended by diplomats’ spouses. Getty and Alamy published the image, claiming the younger woman was Xi Mingze and the older was Peng Liyuan. With no verified adult images of Xi Mingze in public circulation, the photo seemed plausible. Mainstream media outlets used it without deeper verification, trusting the provided metadata.Xi Mingze is deliberately shielded from public view. Her name in Chinese, returns no search results on major platforms in China due to strict state censorship.No verified adult photos of her exist. So when a rare, polished image surfaced—apparently showing her next to someone resembling her mother—it passed as credible, especially with well-known sources attaching names to faces. This illusion of authenticity led many to accept it at face value.An X user @echetus decided to examine the image more closely. While initial identification seemed sound, the woman labeled as Peng Liyuan clearly didn’t match known photos of the First Lady. Similar ethnicity and hairstyle aside, the differences in facial structure were apparent. Further research led @echetus to a Shutterstock listing from the same event, where the women were identified differently. The older woman was actually Noelle Kwok, a U.S. State Department official and decorated public servant.Shutterstock identified the younger woman not as Xi Mingze, but as Fi (Catherine) Chen. While the name “Fi” is uncommon in Pinyin, it’s likely a nickname or a Westernized form. Little is publicly known about her, but importantly, there is no indication of any link to Xi Jinping’s family. The case was one of mistaken identity, may be unintentional, but significant.The likely cause was initial metadata confusion. It’s not uncommon for early errors in naming or tagging to propagate through syndication networks. Photo agencies and publishers often rely on metadata provided at the time of image upload, especially during fast-paced events. In this case, a mistake appears to have been copied across platforms without deliberate intent. As @echetus noted, this also reflects the deeper challenge of implicit bias, where individuals of the same ethnicity may be mistaken for one another based on superficial traits.This incident shows how quickly a narrative can gain traction when visual proof appears to support it. Even major outlets can unknowingly reinforce misinformation when operating on metadata alone. Without cross-checking or consulting event organizers, an image of two unrelated women was seen worldwide as evidence of Xi Jinping’s daughter making a rare public appearance.The diligent investigation, the narrative was corrected before it spread further. It’s a reminder that images, even those from reliable sources, require independent verification. This case touches on broader issues: algorithmic metadata errors, assumptions rooted in appearance, and the fragility of trust in the media ecosystem. Xi Mingze remains a figure shrouded in intentional privacy—and for now, the world must rely on facts, not false sightings.","An image purporting to show Xi Mingze, the reclusive daughter of Chinese President Xi Jinping, has circulated widely online.

A small plane carrying a 41-year-old man and a 17-year-old girl crashed into the Long Island Sound off the coast of Connecticut on Sunday morning, but both miraculously survived with only minor injuries, according to the New York Post.The six-seater Piper PA-32 went down near the Thimble Islands around 10.30 am, about ten minutes after taking off from Bridgeport.Before the crash, the pair made a desperate call for help and were directed to attempt an emergency landing at Tweed New Haven Airport. However, they were unable to make it in time.They were rescued when the Coast Guard Station New Haven sent a 45-foot response boat to the scene after the Sector Long Island Sound Command Center was alerted by the air traffic control tower that the aircraft had gone down.According to Branford fire department deputy chief Jason Karpovich, the initial emergency call was reported as a “boat taking on water” before a dispatcher realised it involved a sinking plane. Fire officials arrived at the crash site in a rescue boat roughly 25 minutes after the incident, by which time the aircraft was fully submerged.The Piper PA-32 is a single-engine plane built by Piper Aircraft.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

iPhone 16e: 5 Reasons to buy the most affordable iPhone 16 series model!

Movies are shot on these ultra-expensive cinema cameras, but lately makers have been using phones also, often an iPhone and people even call that ambitious. But, Danny Boyle built a custom rig to hold 20 of them. The unconventional setup for his $75 million zombie sequel 28 Years Later for action shots that the director describes as ""basically a poor man's bullet time.""The sequel to his 2002’s 28 Days Later, employed three different iPhone rigs throughout production. One held eight phones, another ten, and the largest accommodated a full 20 iPhone 15 Pro Max(es). These multi-camera setups could be mounted on cranes or carried by crew members to capture sweeping 180-degree views of the action.""There is an incredible shot in the second half where we use the 20-rig camera, and you'll know it when you see it,"" Boyle revealed to IGN. ""It's quite graphic but it's a wonderful shot that uses that technique in a startling way that kicks you into a new world.""The iPhone choice wasn't arbitrary, it's a deliberate callback to the original 28 Days Later, which made waves in 2002 by using consumer-grade Canon digital camcorders instead of traditional film cameras. Last year, Boyle said he wanted to capture the same raw, immediate feel that defined the franchise's aesthetic.""I suppose you could ignore it, but we decided to carry it as an influence,"" Boyle explained, noting that smartphones are today's equivalent of the camcorders that would have documented a real zombie apocalypse in 2002.Boyle say that this multi-camera setup offered, what he calls “unexpected” benefits beyond creating a visual spectacle.""It gives you 180 degrees of vision of an action, and in the editing you can select any choice from it,"" he explained. ""Either a conventional one-camera perspective or make your way instantly around reality, time-slicing the subject, jumping forward or backward for emphasis."" The setup also kept his cast alert and unpredictable, preventing them from anticipating camera angles during intense scenes.Despite using smartphones as the primary filming device, 28 Years Later won’t look like typical phone footage. Professional cinema lenses were mounted in front of the iPhone cameras, and the production received technical support from Apple during filming. The phones shot in Apple's ProRes codec with log color profiles, preserving maximum image data for post-production color grading and editing.28 Years Later drops in theaters June 20, bringing back Boyle alongside original writer Alex Garland and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle. The cast includes Jodie Comer, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Ralph Fiennes as survivors trying to make it in a world still reeling from the Rage Virus nearly three decades later. They're already deep into filming the follow-up, 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple, with The Marvels director Nia DaCosta taking the helm for a 2026 release, part of what's shaping up to be a whole new trilogy for the zombie franchise (those 28 weeks don't matter much, guess so).","Danny Boyle built a custom rig for his $75 million zombie sequel 28 Years Later for action shots that the director describes as ""basically a poor man's bullet time"" The sequel to his 2002’s 28 Days Later, employed three different iPhone rigs throughout production.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121574376,imgsize-1931618,width-400,resizemode-4/The-rig-that-straps-together-20-iPhones-Image-Sony.jpg"
Why Microsoft is warning Authenticator app users to save their passwords on Edge browser immediately,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-microsoft-is-warning-authenticator-app-users-to-save-their-passwords-on-edge-browser-immediately/articleshow/121573485.cms,"What Microsoft said about transferring passwords from Authenticator to Edge

“Your saved passwords (but not your generated password history) and addresses are securely synced to your Microsoft account, and you can continue to access them and enjoy seamless autofill functionality with Microsoft Edge, a secure and user-friendly AI-powered web browser that offers features such as Microsoft Defender SmartScreen, Password Monitor, and InPrivate search.”





“Starting June 2025, you will no longer be able to save new passwords in Authenticator. During July 2025, you will not be able to use autofill with Authenticator. From August 2025, your saved passwords will no longer be accessible in Authenticator.”

How to use Microsoft Edge’s password autofill feature



Microsoft is asking users of the Authenticator app to back up all their saved passwords immediately. This comes after the company announced plans to phase out the app’s password management capabilities starting next month. Microsoft Authenticator, which is widely used for providing two-factor authentication for online accounts, offers users the convenience of storing and autofilling passwords for various apps and websites, a feature that will now be removed. The company is now shifting its password management feature to its Edge browser.In a blog post, Microsoft explains how this change will affect users. The company writes:The company has confirmed:The tech giant has also noted that any saved payment information, including credit card details stored in the Authenticator app, will be deleted by the deadline. This payment data will not automatically transfer to the Microsoft Edge browser and will require users to manually re-enter their card details in Edge if they wish to continue using Microsoft's ecosystem for payment information storage.To keep using generated passwords, users should save them from the Generator history (accessible via the appropriate icon or option from the Password tab) into their saved passwords. Microsoft Authenticator will continue to support passkeys.However, it's important to note that if passkeys are set up for a Microsoft account, users must ensure that Authenticator remains enabled as the Passkey Provider. Disabling Authenticator will also disable the associated passkeys.To use autofill with Microsoft Edge, users need to set Edge as their default autofill provider on their mobile devices. For iPhone users, this involves downloading the Microsoft Edge browser and navigating to the device’s settings. Under General, they must select “Autofill & Passwords” and then choose Edge from the list of available password managers. Once Edge is selected and the user has signed in, their passwords and addresses will be securely synced with their Microsoft account. These details can be managed through the Edge app under Settings > Passwords. It’s important to note that if passkeys have been set up for a Microsoft Account, the Microsoft Authenticator app must remain enabled as the designated Passkey Provider, as disabling it will result in the loss of access to those passkeys.Android users follow a similar process. After downloading the Edge browser, they need to go to their device’s settings and search for the Autofill option. Under Preferred Service, they should choose Edge. After signing in to the Edge browser, autofill will become active, and their passwords and addresses will be securely synced with their Microsoft account. These can also be accessed through Edge’s Settings under the Passwords section.Additional precautions apply to Android users who have set up passkeys for work or school accounts using the Authenticator app. In such cases, they need to ensure that the Authenticator toggle is enabled under Device Settings > Autofill > Additional Services. Turning off Authenticator will also disable the use of passkeys. Furthermore, for security reasons, payment information is not synced to Edge or any other app and is saved only on the device where it was entered. Microsoft has announced that any payment information stored in the Authenticator app will be deleted after July 2025, requiring users to manually re-enter this data if needed.To access saved passwords in Microsoft Edge on a mobile device, users can simply open the app, tap the menu icon, go to Settings, and select Passwords.","Microsoft is moving its password management feature from the Authenticator app to its Edge browser. The company is asking Authenticator users to back up all their saved passwords immediately. Microsoft Authenticator will continue to support passkeys.

ESPN taking over Inside the NBA



Fans worried over the takeover





Days after Inside the NBA made its last appearance on TV, almost 40 years after it first began broadcasting, fans and basketball players, commentators had a different emotional experience. After TNT lost rights for broadcasting, ESPN took over the decision and will now be showcasing the same. The idea that ESPN has is to not change anything with respect to the broadcasting, so that fans don’t experience any change.All the famous basketball stars, especially Ernie Johnson, Charles Barkley , Shaquille O’Neal and Kenny Smith bid an emotional goodbye to their fans after their brilliant commentary.

As per Sports Illustrated, he said, I’m hearing from sources that ESPN has zero plans to change the iconic show’s DNA, TNT will retain full editorial control. So expect to see the same funny, bombastic, basketball show that’s earned 21 Sports Emmy Awards during its historic run.”Fans have been worried about the broadcasting, especially, with respect to the content that was shown, which was entertaining.However, ESPN allowed bigger stars like Pat McAfee and Stephan A Smith to take up the opportunity without any regulations.Sports Illustrated said, as per a source, who told McCarthy, “Some of the speculation’s just nuts. ESPN has wanted Barkley and this show for 20 years. Now that they’ve got it, why would they change it?”While Inside the NBA’s popular face, Kenny Smith was doubtful about the same. He said, 'We have the same crew of people doing the show,' Smith said. 'But the timing: Are we a half hour now? Are we forty-five minutes? Fifteen minutes? Those are the things that you can control when you own your I.P. But we don't. That was the only part that made me uncomfortable and disheartened.'A fan said, “Farewell to TNT, Mamba forever.”Another fan said,“Inside The NBA is the best sports show that has ever existed and I am sad that it’s over but so very thankful that it existed.”Another fan reacted, saying, “NBA on TNT had a historical run, all the moments from Inside the NBA, to Kevin Harlan’s classic calls…We thank Ernie, Shaq, Chuck, Kenny, Kevin, and the rest of the crew over the years for providing the best sports show of our lives.”Also Read: Will Stephan Curry eye an NBA TV broadcasting role post-retirement?
