NEW DELHI: Amid the continuing grounding of 330 `Dhruv’ advanced light helicopters (ALHs) after a crash three months ago, which has hit operations in the armed forces, Hindustan Aeronautics on Friday publicly lashed out at some serving military officers, former pilots, “so-called defence analysts” and “arm-chair critics” for spreading “malicious” and “speculative” narratives on the indigenous 5.5-tonne chopper.“These stories are written without offering HAL’s perspective, and arguments are one-sided and biased. HAL would like to reiterate it’s working with all its customers including IAF and is confident of handling the critical issues that are innate to the defence aeronautics and complex flying platforms,” the defence PSU said, in a statement.Critics, in turn, were quick to respond and demand complete transparency on flight safety issues . “The interests of your (HAL) stakeholders are best served if you welcome criticism, work with greater transparency, stop shooting messengers and hallucinating about malafide intent. Your worst critic is not your enemy; just as a sycophant is not your best friend. Learn to differentiate,” former naval aviator and test pilot Commander K P Sanjeev Kumar (retd) said.HAL has been facing tremendous flak in recent months due to the huge delays in production of indigenous Tejas Mark-1A fighters as well as the grounding of all the twin-engine ALHs, designed and produced by the PSU, since the crash in Porbandar on Jan 5.As was first reported by TOI, the armed forces had immediately suspended flying operations of all their 330 ALHs after the crash, in which the two Coast Guard pilots and a diver were killed, to ensure proper safety checks. HAL is yet to conclusively establish what led to the “swashplate fracture” in the ill-fated helicopter that made the pilots lose control of the machine.","HAL has been facing tremendous flak in recent months due to the huge delays in production of indigenous Tejas Mark-1A fighters.

Just as the sun scorches the boneless creature,

So does virtue burn those without love.

Recently, I visited an old teacher of mine who had been hospitalised. Her children had made the heart-wrenching decision to admit her to a palliative care centre. With quiet resignation, he told me, “She has become immobile—her bones are too weak. Caring for her has become difficult.”As I looked at her, my eyes welled up. I could still hear the echo of her footsteps as she did the rounds in the corridors of our school—that struck fear and respect in equal measure.To now see her curled up in a bed, frail and still, was painful.My mind wandered back to her voice as she brought Julius Ceaser’s fall to life for us—“ O, what a fall was there, my countrymen! Then I, and you, and all of us fell down.”Those words, once recited with such power, now felt prophetic.As people live longer, we seem to be shifting our gaze fromto. The question is no longer, but. At the heart of this lies the quiet strength of bones and muscles.Medical professionals and evolutionary scientists alike regard bones—particularly the spine—with reverence. The moment the human species stood upright, something shifted in the great story of evolution. The feat freed our hands for creating tools and crafting civilizations.Our skeleton does far more than give us shape—it shields, supports, and enables. And unlike what many think, bones are not static. They are in a constant dance of regeneration—replacing themselves every decade, keeping us upright, quite literally, in body and spirit.I find it deeply poetic is that Thiruvalluvar, the sage of profound brevity, refers to bones in the chapter on(love). And it wasn’t poetic convenience of rhyming(love) and(bone).Valluvar , the master craftsman of thought, equated bones to the soul's scaffold, just as love gives shape and meaning to human existence.“The unloving belong only to themselves. But the loving belongs to others—to their very bones.”Commentators often draw on the tale of Rishi Dadhichi, who gave up his bones to forge the divine weaponthat defeated evil. The very design of India’s Param Vir Chakra—our highest military honour—bears the mark of this ultimate sacrifice.In another verse, Valluvar says:“The throb of life is love. Without it, humans are but skeletons draped in skin.”And my favourite couplet,Here, he paints a haunting image: a boneless creature, like a worm, writhing under the harsh sun—symbolic of those without love being consumed by the very ethics they fail to uphold. In his verse, ethics is not a code—it is the omnipotent God that can destruct, and love is the only shelter.As I sat beside my teacher, soon to be left in the care of strangers, I couldn’t help but wonder—are we slowly becoming a spineless society? One that cannot bear the weight of its own elders? Have we let love become so brittle that it fractures under the demands of convenience?Perhaps that’s the reason Valluvar tried to connect bones and bonds – not once but thrice, in his chapter on love.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120199254,imgsize-46060,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/120199254.jpg"

Taylor Swift and Kanye West have been engaged in a feud with each other since 2009 even though the billionaire pop star has mostly stayed away from him and does not make any controversial statements.

Kayla Nicole’s journey from being judged to being empowered

Welcome to The Pre-Game

Kayla Nicole has been candid about her emotional journey post-breakup with Travis Kelce , shedding light on how not just he but other past partners treated her harshly. In the debut episode of her new podcast The Pre-Game, Kayla reflected on how dating high-profile men led to toxic dynamics and emotional pain, ultimately pushing her to change how she approaches love and relationships.Kayle Nicole admitted that the experience of dating someone in the public eye came with a price constant scrutiny, unsolicited opinions, and being dragged into media storms she never asked for. After her split from Kelce in 2022, the situation escalated when Travis Kelce began dating Taylor Swift. The online harassment Kayla faced intensified, with people comparing her to Swift, questioning her worth, and making cruel comments. She confessed that this hate still affects her to this day, despite having done nothing to deserve it.Kayla Nicole, who once interned at TMZ and the Oprah Winfrey Network before launching her own media brand, is now opening up on her podcast The Pre-Game about the struggles behind her success. In a recent episode, she recalled a college relationship with a then-NBA hopeful a man she supported, only to have him dim her own ambitions in return. It was a painful chapter that shaped her resilience and drive.""It's not that simple. It's not going to happen,"" she explained.Kayla Nicole shared that these experiences left her feeling broken and deeply self-conscious, saying she spent a long time trying to heal. She was often forced to explain herself or stay silent while the world judged her unfairly. It made her realize that even though her past relationships brought temporary highs, the emotional toll was far too great.In a heartfelt moment, Nicole said, ""I’ve been harshly treated by more than one man. Travis wasn’t only one. But the aftermath of that relationship taught me to put myself first.""Now, she’s taking a different path, one that prioritizes privacy, peace, and emotional safety. Kayla Nicole stated she’s no longer interested in making her romantic life public, joking that she's now “dating and hiding.” She won’t reveal who she’s with unless she’s married and has a family. For Kayla, this boundary isn't about secrecy, it's about protection.Also Read: Kayla Nicole and the ‘gold digger’ myth: Debunking outdated stereotypes about women dating athletes Kayla Nicole's story is resonating with many who’ve faced similar situations, and she’s using her voice to advocate for healing, setting boundaries, and choosing self-love over public validations.",Kayla Nicole opened up on her new podcast The Pre-Game.

Podcast survey stirs up controversy with Taylor Swift references

Brandon Graham on Retirement, Rookie Jason Stories, Art of Trash Talking & The Brady Sack | EP 133

Fan backlash highlights tensions between fame and privacy



Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has found himself at the center of controversy—not for something he said, but for what fans think he and his podcast team might be implying. A listener questionnaire tied to his hit show New Heights, which he co-hosts with his brother Jason Kelce, has drawn sharp criticism from Taylor Swift ’s fanbase, who believe the show is veering too far into her territory.The Kelce brothers' New Heights podcast has enjoyed sky rocketing popularity over the past year. While much of that success is thanks to their NFL credentials and brotherly banter, the show has also benefited from Travis’s high-profile relationship with global pop icon Taylor Swift. But a recent listener survey—distributed by podcast network Wondery—has made some fans feel uncomfortable with how that relationship is being used.The survey featured response options directly referencing Swift, such as: ""I was drawn to the prospect of hearing details and clues about Taylor Swift's life and her relationship with Travis,"" and ""I like feeling like a part of the community that supports Taylor's happiness outside of her music."" These choices struck a nerve with many Swifties, who accused the podcast of using her name for marketing gain.Swift’s fans didn’t hold back online. Some labeled the survey “gross,” “pathetic,” and “embarrassing.” One user asked pointedly, “Why did you let Wondery ask about Taylor in relation to your podcast?” The criticism quickly snowballed, with others accusing Kelce and his team of “clout-chasing” and relying too heavily on Swift-related content to boost the show’s visibility.Though Travis Kelce has previously spoken respectfully about Swift and organically shared moments from their relationship on the podcast, this overt data-gathering move appeared to cross an unspoken boundary.Neither Kelce nor Wondery has commented publicly on the backlash, but the uproar highlights a tricky balancing act: navigating fame while maintaining personal boundaries. With Taylor Swift’s fan base being one of the most passionate and protective in the world, even small missteps can trigger major reactions.Also Read: “Nonsense”: Travis Kelce shuts down breakup and false community service rumors in latest podcast appearance As New Heights continues to grow, this incident serves as a reminder that not every aspect of a public relationship needs to be leveraged for clicks—even if fans are already listening.",Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has found himself at the center of controversy.

Guide on obtaining Coca Leaves in Schedule 1

How to Make/cook Cocaine in Schedule 1 Game - How to use Cauldron

Unlocking Salvador Moreno

Purchasing Coca Seeds and cultivating into Coca Leaves

Harvesting and processing Coca Leaves

In Schedule 1 , you have to cultivate, produce, and deal different drugs to expand your empire. When it comes to cocaine production, you will need to get Coca Leaves, which can be cultivated from Coca Seeds.However, these seeds aren’t readily available, and are a premium commodity. You will first have to unlock the exclusive dealer named Salvador Moreno, and then order these seeds from him. The guide below will walk you through the process of acquiring Coca Seeds, cultivating them into Coca Leaves, and processing them.To get started, you need to unlock Salvador Moreno, who is the exclusive supplier of Coca Seeds. The supplier operates from the Docks area, and you will have to reach the Enforcer I rank to unlock the same. To achieve the particular rank, you must expand your empire and successfully manage your operations in the other regions.After Docks is open for you, the next thing to do is establish connections with either Javier Perez or Mac Cooper. They will introduce you to Salvador Moreno, and you may then arrange the purchase of Coca Seeds in Schedule 1.As already stated, Coca Seeds are a premium commodity in Schedule 1, and you will have to pay the big bucks to acquire them. If you are ordering them through a dead drop, each seed will cost you $80, and there will be a purchase limit of $2,000 or 10 seeds per transaction. Alternatively, in-person purchases will require you to spend $150 per seed. These seeds will be a significant investment, so you must plan your finances correctly.Once you have got your hands on Coca Seeds, you must start with the cultivation. Planting them follows the same procedure as other seeds that you generally acquire from Albert. All you have to do is set up a grow tent or pot with soil, remove the seed cap, and plant the seed.If you've hired a Botanist in Schedule 1, the process becomes even easier. You must simply put the Coca Seed on an appropriate rack and assign the supplies. The Botanist will take up the entire growth process and would ensure optimal yield.You'll finally have mature Coca Leaves ready for harvest. After harvesting, you can transform these leaves into a sellable product by processing them in a Cauldron. The particular equipment is available upon reaching Enforcer I, and you can purchase it from Oscar for $3,000.Upon setting up the Cauldron, you can begin processing the Coca Leaves, with the standard recipe requiring 20 Coca Leaves and 1 unit of Gasoline. For a higher-quality output, you can also consider drying the Coca Leaves on a drying rack.Additionally, to completely streamline the production, you can consider hiring staff. A fully automated production for the particular drug requires you to have one Botanist, three Handlers, and four Chemists.","In Schedule 1, you have to cultivate, produce, and deal different drugs to expand your empire.

Poll Do you support the introduction of the Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for European visitors to the UK? No Yes

Europeans Need Permit To Enter Uk, Trumps Reciprocal Tariffs Begin April 2

UK has introduced a new online entry requirements for European visitors from Wednesday, implementing a digital Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) permit as part of enhanced security measures.European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9. The system has already been operational for visitors from America, Canada and other visa-exempt nations since Britain's EU departure in 2020.UK border force chief Phil Douglas confirmed this implementation as part of a broader global rollout, emphasising its primary function as a security measure.The system aims to expedite entry procedures whilst enabling background checks on immigration history and criminal records. Douglas highlighted that approved travellers would benefit from faster border crossing through eGates.""The quid pro quo for the individual, though, is that we are building a contactless border, so if they're cleared for entry, they'll be able to use our new eGates and they'll be able to go through the border much more quickly,"" he added.During the initial buffer period, expected to continue until ""September or October,"" travellers can still proceed with their journeys. The ETA remains valid for two years, permitting stays up to six months.Applications opened to Europeans in March, covering approximately 30 countries, excluding Ireland. Applicants must submit passport photos and facial images through a smartphone app or government website, typically taking 10 minutes to complete.Whilst most applications receive swift responses, authorities advise allowing three working days. The requirement extends to all ages, though transit passengers not crossing UK borders are exempt following Heathrow Airport's concerns about European connection traffic.Heathrow, which handled 84 million passengers in 2024 with one-third from the EU, initially launched the scheme for Qatar in 2023 before expanding to Gulf nations. By January, it included about 50 additional countries including Argentina, South Korea and New Zealand.","European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9.

Hallmarking and gold purity





Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Gold purity: When purchasing gold, especially for investment or jewellery purposes, understanding the different levels of gold purity is important. You might have come across terms like 24-karat gold and fineness numbers like 999 or 995. Here's what they mean and how they relate to the purity of gold.According to ET, if you're looking to buy the purest gold, 24-karat gold is the best choice. You can get it as coins or bars (also known as bullion ). But these coins and bars are often labelled with either ""999"" or ""995"" fineness, which can be confusing. This is because there are two ways to measure gold's purity.Gold purity can be measured in two ways: karats and fineness. According to the World Gold Council , ""karat"" measures the purity of gold mixed with other metals. For example, 24-karat gold is considered pure because it doesn't contain other metals. However, gold is usually not perfectly pure in reality. The highest level of purity that can typically be achieved is 999.9 parts per thousand, which means there's a tiny fraction of impurities.""Fineness"" also measures gold purity, but it’s expressed in parts per thousand. In this system, 24-karat gold would have a fineness of 1.0 (meaning it's completely pure), while 22-karat gold has a fineness of about 0.916 (22 parts gold out of 24). Gold of this purity is often labelled as 999.9 fineness, indicating its virtually pure 24-karat gold.Vikas Singh, MD & CEO of MMTC-PAMP - a semi-government gold refinery was quoted as saying, “995, 999 and 999.9 purity levels are international nomenclatures used to define the purity of gold per 1,000 grams. At a weight of 1,000 grams of gold, a purity of 995 means that you get 995 grams of gold with 5 grams of another metal; 999 purity means 999 grams of gold with 1 gram of another metal, while 999.9 means you get only 0.1 gram of another metal while the rest is pure gold . The difference between 995, 999 and 999.9 fineness lies in the purity level of the gold.”This is the highest purity you can get with gold. It means that the gold is 99.90% pure, with only 0.10% impurities. This type of gold is commonly used for investment in coins and bars, known as bullion.This gold has a slightly lower purity, at 99.50%. While still considered 24-karat, it's not as pure as 999 gold. It's generally used in bullion and some jewellery applications.The key difference between 995, 999, and 999.9 is the amount of gold in each measurement.Experts say that 999 fineness is the purest gold you can get, while 995 fineness is standard for trading on the MCX and international markets. Both 999 and 995 are very pure, containing 99.90% and 99.50% gold, respectively. No refinery can consistently produce purer gold than these levels.The higher the purity of gold, the more expensive it is. That's why 24-karat gold costs more than 22-karat gold. Similarly, gold with 999 fineness will cost more than gold with 995 fineness, even if both are 24-karat.Experts say that gold with 999 fineness is typically 0.4% more expensive than gold with 995 fineness. This difference reflects the added purity.Surendra Mehta, the National Secretary of the India Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA), explains that this price gap is due to the purity level. For example, if gold with 995 fineness costs 100, then gold with 999 fineness will cost about 100.40.Most jewellers don't sell 24-karat gold jewellery because it's too soft. You typically find 24-karat gold as bars, coins, or bullion.Singh from MMTC-PAMP explains that gold with 999 fineness isn't strong enough for jewellery, so jewellers usually use 22-karat gold or lower, mixing gold with other metals for durability. However, 995 fineness gold can be used for coins, bars, pendants, and other small items.Suvankar Sen, from Senco Gold & Diamonds, notes that jewellery is typically made with 22, 18, or 14-karat gold. Bars and coins are often available in 995 and 999 fineness. If you see 999 or 995 gold used in jewellery, it's usually in the form of bars or coins, which might be worn as pendants.Sen adds that 24-karat jewellery is rare because it requires special machines to make it. Some markets in western India offer 23-karat jewellery, which is more traditional and often comes in smaller pieces.Mehta points out that coins and bars are the main products made with 999 and 995 fineness gold.The government made gold hallmarking mandatory from June 16, 2021, for six levels of gold purity: 14KT, 18KT, 20KT, 22KT, 23KT, and 24KT. For 24-karat gold, hallmarking uses a 995 fineness standard.Mehta from the India Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA) explains that if you're buying 24-karat gold jewellery, hallmarking is required. However, if you're purchasing 24-karat gold in the form of coins, bullion, or bars, hallmarking isn't mandatory.","Gold purity can be measured in two ways: karats and fineness. 24-karat gold is considered pure because it doesn't contain other metals. The highest level of purity that can typically be achieved is 999.9 parts per thousand. The higher the purity of gold, the more expensive it is.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109983518,imgsize-74336,width-400,resizemode-4/109983518.jpg"

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109067339,imgsize-51000,width-400,resizemode-4/109067339.jpg"

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Bill Gates reveals the one trait that could’ve made him a better manager,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-reveals-the-one-trait-that-couldve-made-him-abettermanager/articleshow/120214749.cms,"Bill Gates reveals the one trait that could’ve made him a better manager

Why Bill Gates thinks his old leadership style held Microsoft back

“I think if you want to work hard and not fool yourself, you better be pretty hard on yourself,”

“We were a fairly homogeneous, very engineering-orientated group,”

Bill Gates admits: ‘If you can’t do math, you can’t do anything’ was a mistake

“I sort of thought, if you can do math, you can do anything. And if you can’t do math, you can’t do anything,”

The turning point: From tech titan to global collaborator

“I was able to take mistakes I'd made, and learnings from Microsoft, and bring that to the foundation,”

Why Bill Gates says great managers adapt, not demand

“The one change that could’ve made me a better manager earlier?”

“Recognizing that talent isn’t one-size-fits-all.”

Bill Gates finds joy in learning, even after changing the world

“It is a lot of fun,” Gates said. “I get to work with smart people. I'm learning all the time. I get to travel the world.”

In a rare and candid conversation on the ""People by WTF"" podcast, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates offered a revealing account of his evolution as a leader—from the intense early years at Microsoft to his more collaborative role in global philanthropy today. Speaking with host Nikhil Kamath, Gates unpacked how his high standards and exacting personal discipline once hindered his ability to manage others effectively.His reflections shed light on the challenges of leadership in the fast-paced world of tech and the importance of adaptability, empathy, and recognizing diverse forms of talent. As Gates shared, becoming a good manager was a process of trial, error, and deep self-examination—lessons he would later apply with greater impact at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.During the formative years of Microsoft, Gates admitted that his leadership approach mirrored the way he treated himself—relentlessly high-pressure and narrowly focused on intellectual excellence.Gates explained, acknowledging how this mindset translated into his management approach.His internal expectations, based on a rigorous work ethic and technical prowess, created a performance culture that favored those who shared his engineering mindset. However, this style proved limiting.Gates said.This homogeneity, he acknowledged, led to missed opportunities to recruit and retain talented individuals who didn't fit the mold but could have brought valuable perspectives.Gates described how he once held a binary view of talent—believing that proficiency in mathematics was the primary indicator of potential.he confessed.This reductive thinking shaped Microsoft’s early culture, where analytical prowess often overshadowed other skills like communication, leadership, and cross-functional collaboration. Gates now views this assumption as a significant blind spot in his early career.The transformation in Gates’ management philosophy accelerated after he transitioned to full-time work at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Unlike in the tech sector, the foundation required broad, multidisciplinary collaboration—working with policymakers, health experts, educators, and community leaders.he said.At the foundation, success depended not just on IQ or coding skills but on empathy, negotiation, and cultural awareness—qualities that had been undervalued in Microsoft’s early days.One of Gates’ most important takeaways was the realization that intelligence and capability come in many forms. Leadership, he learned, requires more than managing deliverables—it requires recognizing the diverse strengths of team members and adapting one’s style accordingly.Gates reflected.This lesson became central to his work in philanthropy, where success is rarely achieved in isolation and often depends on partnerships across sectors and continents.Today, Gates continues to apply his trademark discipline, but without the rigidity that once characterized his leadership. He remains deeply involved in global initiatives and thrives in environments where learning and collaboration are prioritized.Despite decades of success, Gates emphasised that he is still learning—and still evolving.","Bill Gates reveals the one trait that could’ve made him a better manager.

Hackers have reportedly leaked Elon Musk’s travel preferences. In stolen documents from Berkshire Hathaway-owned NetJets, hackers have revealed unknown details about the travel preferences of the Tesla and SpaceX CEO that combine high-speed efficiency with laid-back comfort, a report claims. The leaked memo, which is a part of a guide for serving the high-profile client, reveals that Musk insists on flying as fast and directly as possible. As per the memo, he even dismisses fuel conservation and has strict instructions for crew members to avoid small talk unless he initiates it. It further notes that, much like any regular traveler, he expects uninterrupted WiFi and values the ability to take naps during flights.According to a service plan from November 2024 (seen by Bloomberg), Musk likes the cabin at 65 degrees and the lights dim. He also prefers the passenger air vents switched off, as he “does not like the noise” they make, the memo notes.Despite NetJets declining to confirm the document’s authenticity, the Bloomberg report cited three individuals familiar with the situation who suggested that the company’s flight attendants receive “passenger service plans” similar to Musk’s, which brief them on a traveler's preferences during a flight.The document specifies that crew members shouldn’t offer any technological help. “Mr. Musk considers himself self-sufficient and does not need help with technology — if he does, he will ask.”It's important to note that NetJets is currently investigating a breach in which a hacker obtained “limited” information from “a very small number of owners,” the report continues.The company, which offers shared private aircraft ownership—with some clients being referred to as owners—reported that the attacker successfully “phished” an employee to capture their work account credentials and subsequently used that access to extract additional data from NetJets’ systems last month, the report added.Previously, Musk banned an account from his social media platform X (earlier Twitter) for tracking his flights.","Hackers have reportedly leaked Elon Musk’s travel preferences.

What is Chicken Jockey scene in Minecraft Movie

Minecraft Movie director responds

Electric Palace Picture House in Cannock, Staffordshire has reportedly banned under-18s from attending evening showings of A Minecraft Movie without an adult. According to a BBC report, children under 18 will not be allowed to watch the movie unaccompanied after 18:30 BST. The movie released earlier this month and has broken box office records to become the highest opening video game movie of all time. According to The Guardian, the movie recorded the highest-ever first weekend total for a video game adaptation. At the same time, it has also become the centre of cinema disturbance after a viral TikTok trend, shouting ‘ Chicken Jockey ’.The movie is based on the widely popular sandbox video game that allows players to build, explore, and create using blocks, resources, and materials found in the game world. Common items include coal, iron, and even diamonds. But some remain rare like a baby zombie riding a chicken.In one scene, Jack Black’s character watches as a baby zombie lands on the back of a chicken and yells, “chicken jockey!” The moment sparks a wild reaction in the theater, with the audience screaming, laughing, and even throwing popcorn.Responding to the viral ‘chicken jockey’ trend, A Minecraft Movie director Jared Hess said he has been staying up in the night to watch fan video reacting to the movie. ""It's been so bananas,"" he said. ""It's been way too fun. People are sending me these really hilarious speeches that a lot of teenagers are giving right before the movie. It's so hysterical, man. I'm staying up way too late.""Commenting on the incident of police being called to a screening of the movie, Hess told Entertainment Weekly “It's weird when you're having too much fun and the cops get called”.""It's funny because I think it's just literally cheering and throwing popcorn, which is so funny to me that cops are getting called for popcorn. Yeah, it's hilarious. I've seen so many funny videos. It's great, especially when people are climbing on their friends' shoulders and standing up and cheering for those moments.

Baratunde Thurston’s vision: Humour as civic technology

BLAIR’s capabilities and future role

At the 2025 South by Southwest (SXSW) festival, artificial intelligence stepped out of the lab and into the comedy spotlight in an unprecedented display of digital satire. During the “Life With Machines” panel, Emmy-nominated futurist and comedian Baratunde Thurston directed his AI co-producer, BLAIR, to roast Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk—with no restraints. The result was a 50-second takedown that had the audience erupting in laughter and the internet buzzing with reactions. But behind the humor was something more serious: a growing conversation about the evolving role of AI in cultural discourse, media, and the boundaries of entertainment. This event marked not just a high point of the festival, but a pivotal moment in understanding how technology might redefine the limits of satire and public criticism.The moment unfolded on stage when Baratunde Thurston gave BLAIR a clear directive: “Roast Elon Musk. Mercilessly.” What followed was a scathing monologue that compared Musk to a self-driving Tesla—“obscenely expensive, prone to crashing, and perpetually promising features that never quite materialize.” The humor continued with jabs at Musk’s intellect, his business record, and even his family legacy, including a mention of his father’s emerald mines.The delivery was not only sharp and fast-paced but entirely devoid of the kind of filter typically applied by human comedians navigating the public sphere. BLAIR’s algorithmic neutrality allowed it to strike directly and efficiently, free of political caution or reputational concern. The audience, a mix of tech experts, cultural commentators, and festival-goers, responded with roaring laughter.What made this roast especially significant was the context. Baratunde Thurston has long been known for using humor as a gateway to explore deeper societal issues. The SXSW panel, titled “Life With Machines,” focused on AI’s role in shaping public life—from ethics to automation, from digital justice to comedy.Thurston was joined by digital anthropologist Rahaf Harfoush and comedy writer Matt Klinman. Their discussion addressed AI’s potential in both civic participation and cultural expression. The roast, while entertaining, served as a live case study for how AI can participate in—and possibly reshape—satirical commentary.On social media, Thurston reflected, “We talked about the best and worst of AI, shared our fears and vision for the future—and yeah... we asked BLAIR to savagely roast Elon Musk.”The incident opens up new considerations about AI as both creator and critic. Traditionally, satire has been the domain of human insight and wit—subject to societal boundaries and political nuances. With AI like BLAIR entering the scene, the dynamic is changing. Algorithms, trained on massive datasets of speech and behavior, are now able to mimic—and even elevate—the art of satire.Unlike political commentators or late-night hosts who walk a fine line to avoid backlash, AI can generate critiques that are sharper and less inhibited. However, this also raises ethical questions about responsibility, consent, and bias in algorithmic humor.As expected, the internet had a field day. Clips of the roast went viral on platforms like Instagram and X (formerly Twitter), where users responded with a mix of humor and astonishment. “You said mercilessly and the AI went all over it xD,” one user commented. Another quipped, “The only thing Blair didn’t touch on is the number of children and baby mamas he has without paying child support.” “Hey human here. If you needed someone to insult him, there are many humans who could have done better,” joked another.Despite the light-hearted tone, the responses highlighted how AI-driven satire resonates across digital audiences and transcends cultural and national boundaries.Baratunde’s inclusion of AI in his satirical work is not without purpose. He is best known for his bestselling book How to Be Black and the podcast How to Citizen, both of which merge humor with civic inquiry. His goal at SXSW was to show how technology can be used not just to optimize systems, but to enhance dialogue, critique power, and engage communities.This AI-led roast was an extension of that philosophy—an effort to reimagine how machines might participate in democratic discourse, not just as tools or threats, but as co-creators.BLAIR, the AI involved in the roast, was developed specifically for public engagement and creative tasks. Built on large language models and fine-tuned for tonal awareness, BLAIR is designed to collaborate with human hosts on live shows, podcasts, and educational events. Its ability to handle humor, satire, and sensitive topics while maintaining audience engagement is part of ongoing research into ethical AI communication.Thurston revealed that BLAIR had been trained on decades of stand-up routines, political commentary, and journalistic editorials to develop a voice that was both informed and impactful. Importantly, BLAIR operates with editorial oversight, meaning its content is curated and refined with the help of human collaborators.","At the 2025 South by Southwest (SXSW) festival, artificial intelligence stepped out of the lab and into the comedy spotlight.

Facebook aims to solve one of the ‘biggest problem’ of AI models that in the year 2024 made Google CEO Sundar Pichai say 'We Got it Wrong',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebook-aims-to-solve-one-of-the-biggest-problem-of-ai-models-that-in-the-year-2024-made-google-ceo-sundar-pichai-say-we-got-it-wrong/articleshow/120201526.cms,"Meta says Llama 4 demonstrates advancements in reducing bias

Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s comment on Gemini image generation controversy

Facebook parent company Meta recently launched the Llama 4 AI model. The Mark Zuckerberg-led company said that it aims to address one of the biggest problems of bias in large language models (LLMs) while acknowledging the historical tendency of leading LLMs to exhibit a left-leaning bias on politically and socially debated topics. The company said that the problem is due to the nature of training data sourced from the internet.The company said that the core objective driving the development of Llama 4 has been to mitigate this bias, the company said in a blog post it released soon after it launched the Llama 4 AI models.“Our goal is to remove bias from our AI models and to make sure that Llama can understand and articulate both sides of a contentious issue. As part of this work, we’re continuing to make Llama more responsive so that it answers questions, can respond to a variety of different viewpoints without passing judgment, and doesn't favor some views over others,” it added.Facebook says it has made improvements in bias reduction compared to its predecessor, Llama 3 and is comparable to Grok, which is developed by Elon Musk-owned xAI. These advancements include reduced refusal rates: a decrease in the frequency of refusing to respond to questions on debated political and social topics.Facebook says that the model shows a significantly more balanced approach in its refusals and testing indicates that Llama 4's tendency to respond with a strong political lean is now comparable to Grok.Google faced criticism last year when its AI chatbot Gemini produced historically inaccurate and racially biased images, including depictions of America's founding fathers and war heroes. The chatbot reportedly declined to depict white people in certain scenarios. In response, Google suspended Gemini's image generation feature and apologised for “missing the mark.”Google CEO Sundar Pichai addressed the controversy, stating, “I know that some of its responses have offended our users and shown bias – to be clear, that’s completely unacceptable and we got it wrong.” He emphasised that Google is working to resolve these issues, while acknowledging that “No AI is perfect, especially at this emerging stage of the industry’s development.”",Facebook parent company Meta recently launched the Llama 4 AI model.

Who founded Formula E

All eyes are currently on Formula 1 , as the season kicked off last month in Australia. However, there's another motorsport series that deserves just as much attention—one that not only thrills but is also in tune with the global movement for sustainability. Enter Formula E, the FIA-recognized single-seater world championship. Like Formula 1, it showcases high-speed racing, but with a key distinction: it’s environmentally conscious. Formula E uses all-electric cars, offering a cleaner, greener alternative to traditional motorsports while also driving innovation in the electric vehicle sector.Formula E cars are smaller, lighter, and require far fewer tire changes over the course of the season, which helps minimize their environmental footprint. And if you’re wondering whether these electric racers can deliver the same level of excitement as Formula 1, consider this: the Generation 3 Formula E car can reach speeds exceeding 100 km/h, proving that sustainability and speed can indeed go hand in hand.The ABB FIA Formula E Championship is currently in its 11th season, with the next race—the Miami ePrix—set for April 12. The season will run until July 27, with many more thrilling races scheduled across the globe.Formula 1 has been around since 1950 and has only evolved into hybrid vehicles relying on fossil fuels like E10 fuel (a mix of 90% petrol and 10% renewable ethanol). In contrast, Formula E is the motorsport of the 21st century after coming into existence in 2014. These races feature all-electric cars that run on powertrains converting energy from a battery into motion.One of the most striking differences between the two sports is how the cars handle tire changes. In Formula 1, teams often swap tires multiple times during a single race due to varying track conditions. In Formula E, however, teams are only allowed to change tires twice throughout the entire championship. The tires used in Formula E are made from natural rubber and recycled fibers, and are specifically designed to perform well in all weather conditions.Despite this difference, Formula E is by no means inferior. While a Formula 1 car can reach speeds in excess of 350 km/h, the new Formula E Gen3 Evo can reach 322 km/h, but it can accelerate faster than a F1 car. It can go from 0-100 km/h in 1.86 seconds., faster than many Formula 1 cars.Although both series use the same chassis, battery, and tires, the real performance differences come from the powertrains provided by each team. There is one aspect where Formula 1 still holds an edge, primarily due to the electric car's battery limitations. As the battery depletes, an electric car loses speed, requiring a pit stop to recharge in a flash. A Formula 1 car, on the other hand, can maintain top speed even with a quarter tank of fuel.Additionally, Formula E cars must be kept light—around 284 kg for the battery, which accounts for one-third of the car's weight that’s fixed at 840 kg, including the driver.Despite the technical differences, Formula E has its own appeal. Even Red Bull driver Max Verstappen has acknowledged how difficult it can be to drive the RB21. In comparison, electric cars in Formula E are simpler, with single-speed transmission and no gear shifts necessary, unlike the multiple gears in a F1 car.Currently, Formula E features 11 teams, with 22 drivers. Unlike Formula 1, where the top speeds are often the focus, Formula E records are typically based on average race speeds. The fastest race in Formula E history took place in Cape Town in 2023, with an average speed of 132.2 km/h.Practice sessions are held on Friday and Saturday, lasting 30 minutes each, giving drivers a chance to fine-tune their performance.Qualifying: Drivers are split into two groups based on their championship standing. Each group has a 10-minute session to set the fastest lap at 300 kW. The top 4 from each group then advance to the ""duels"" stage, where drivers face off head-to-head at 350 kW in a series of quarter-finals, semi-finals, and a final. The winner of the final claims pole position.The top ten drivers receive points using the standard FIA system (25–18–15–12–10–8–6–4–2–1). The pole position winner earns an additional 3 points, while the driver setting the fastest lap (if they finish in the top ten) receives 1 point.Drivers can deploy a combined 8 minutes of Attack Mode during the race. It provides additional power, activated by driving through a designated area of the circuit off the racing line. All Attack Modes must be used before the end of the race.A new feature has been introduced this season. It requires all drivers to make a mandatory 30-second pit stop to recharge their car's batteries at 600 kW. This adds 3.85 kWh of energy (around 10% more) to be used for the remainder of the race.Formula E was founded by Spanish businessman Alejandro Agag, who serves as the company's Chairman, while Jeff Dodds is the Chief Executive Officer. Many may not realize that Warner Bros. Discovery is among its shareholders.","Formula E is the FIA-recognized single-seater world championship.
