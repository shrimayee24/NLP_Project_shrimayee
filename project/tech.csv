BENGALURU: On a summer morning, or any other day, an app might soon guide a courier or gig worker along a route not because it is shortest but because it is coolest. That is the idea behind Ahmedabad Space startup SatLeo Labs’ thermal mapping, which uses space-borne temperature data to help with everyday decisions, from where a city plants its next tree to how a worker plans a trip on a 40°C afternoon.The idea is already being tested. In Tumakuru, 76km from Bengaluru, SatLeo’s pilot uses drone-mounted thermal sensors paired with satellite-derived layers to spot methane leaks and track heat build-up across a 40-acre solid-waste dump.“Tumakuru is moving toward a cleaner and healthier future. With new technologies like thermal intelligence via satellites and drones, we can now see and solve problems faster, whether it is greenhouse gas emissions above solid waste, heat patterns of the city, or open dumps. This project is about making Tumakuru safer, greener, and more comfortable for every citizen,” Ashwija BV, MD & CEO, Tumakuru Smart City Limited, and commissioner, Tumakuru City Corporation, said.SatLeo’s pitch is to build a thermometer for Earth. Co-founder & CEO Shravan Bhati says current datasets smooth out the sharp differences in temperature that define a city. “There’s no accurate temperature information of each and every spot.Existing datasets are interpolated averages; they hide the fact that a park can be several degrees cooler than an industrial block a few hundred metres away,” he told TOI.SatLeo plans a constellation, with its experimental Tapas-1 mission slated for Q1 2026 and a commercial rollout expected later that year. It aims to blend medium-wave and long-wave infrared imaging with 2.5-metre visible imagery and onboard edge computing. The goal is to offer sub-10-metre thermal maps, twice-daily updates and real-time anomaly detection, giving cities and enterprises processed insights rather than large volumes of raw data.One of these products, the “Thermal Comfort API”, is a layer that municipalities or platforms can plug into their systems to measure heat stress at street level. The Tumakuru pilot shows two useful applications.First is landfill emissions. IoT sensors can tell officials how much methane exists, but they cannot identify the exact point of release across a wide dump. Thermal layers help narrow the location to specific pockets so that teams can tackle the problem without searching tens of acres.Second is urban heat. With thermal layers, the city can plan plantations, shade structures and water supply where they will have the most effect. SatLeo’s data has been used in Tumakuru for several months, and the firm is speaking to other municipalities about similar projects.SatLeo also sees a wider market in outdoor labour management. Bhati points out that average city temperatures say little about the conditions faced by gig workers or those in construction. With street-level thermal maps, insurers could verify claims linked to heat exposure, employers could redirect or reschedule tasks during spikes, and health departments could position cooling stations or medicines more precisely.“If the temperature is going above 48°C and up, then the person is insured… but who will make sure where the people were working that the temperature of that location was 48°C?” Bhati asked, stressing the usefulness of their approach.Co-founder Urmil Bakhai says the roadmap is ambitious but grounded, noting that the firm has letters of intent worth $25 million from public and private players. The appeal for city managers is clear: targeted action is cheaper and quicker than broad schemes. For residents and workers, the benefit is straightforward — cooler routes, better-placed trees and quicker detection of harmful emissions.","SatLeo Labs’ thermal mapping uses space-borne temperature data to help with everyday decisions.

New rules to make drunk-driving checks more reliable from April,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-rules-to-make-drunk-driving-checks-more-reliable-from-april/articleshow/125820772.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Beginning April, breath analysers, used to measure blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of drivers or employees, will be required to comply with the newly notified norms issued by the consumer affairs department. The updated standards aim at enhancing accuracy, consistency and credibility of the devices, which play a critical role in law enforcement and workplace safety.Under the revised norms, breath analysers must meet strict limits on permissible error and incorporate a built-in printing mechanism.Significantly, the device will not operate if the printing paper is missing, ensuring that every test conducted is accompanied by a printed record for verification and legal use. Moreover, the device will display only the final measurement result, reducing chances of misinterpretation or tampering during testing.Officials said these measures seek to bolster public trust in the fairness and accuracy of enforcement actions related to drunk driving and workplace safety.The updated devices are designed to deliver rapid and reliable readings, enabling police officers and authorised personnel to make swift, well-informed decisions during checks.This is expected to significantly improve the efficiency of roadside enforcement operations.The norms fall under the amended Legal Metrology Rules, which also outline procedures for verification and scheduled re-verification of instruments. Regular checks will ensure that breath analysers remain accurate throughout their lifecycle and during field use.Traffic police across major cities have increasingly relied on breath analysers to curb drunk driving, especially during late-night patrols and holiday seasons.Road safety experts emphasised that the standardisation of these devices was long overdue, noting that inconsistent readings have often been challenged in courts. The new norms, they said, will help reduce disputes, strengthen prosecution in drunk-driving cases, and contribute to safer roads nationwide.","Breathalysers must meet strict limits on permissible error and incorporate a built-in printing mechanism.

Grim new theory on missing football coach Travis Turner as veteran cop warns about chilling details from the woods,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/grim-new-theory-on-missing-football-coach-travis-turner-as-veteran-cop-warns-about-chilling-details-from-the-woods/articleshow/125811804.cms,"Grim new theory on missing football coach Travis Turner as veteran cop warns about chilling details from the woods (Image via Getty)

Veteran cop explains why Travis Turner’s body may never be found in Virginia woods

Travis Turner may never be found. That is the blunt warning coming from a veteran law enforcement expert as the search for the missing high school football coach in Virginia stretches on with no signs, no sightings, and no solid leads.A former homicide detective says the place where Turner disappeared makes the case far more troubling. Dense woods, steep mountains, cold nights, and wildlife all raise a hard truth: if Travis Turner died in the forest, his body may never be recovered. Police are still searching, but days after his sudden disappearance, the case feels stuck.Travis Turner, 46, vanished from his family home in Appalachia, Virginia, on November 20. According to his family, he left the house with a gun and walked deep into a wooded, mountainous area just as police were heading to speak with him. Days later, authorities charged Turner with 10 crimes, including child pornography possession and using a computer to contact a minor. Since that day, no one has seen or heard from him.Federal law enforcement is now offering a $5,000 reward for tips that lead to his arrest.Still, experts say that may not be enough to break the silence.Dr. Ken Lang, a 25-year law enforcement veteran who is not part of the case, told the Daily Mail that the location alone makes recovery extremely hard. He explained that cold temperatures and thick forest cover can block even advanced search tools.At night, search teams often use helicopters equipped with infrared cameras to spot body heat. But Lang said animals like deer can show up the same way on heat sensors. If a body has already cooled, the camera may show nothing at all.Lang also warned that wildlife can scatter remains, making searches even harder. In that case, teams stop looking for a person and instead search for scraps of clothing or personal items. He compared it to “looking for a needle in a haystack,” especially in the Appalachian Mountains.Search crews are using ground teams, helicopters, bloodhounds, and cadaver dogs. With leaves now off the trees, air crews can see the forest floor better. Officers also look for broken branches, footprints, and signs of movement. Wet ground can help trackers see where someone walked.Still, even dogs have limits. Lang said cadaver dogs can be confused by animal remains, which are common in forests. Dogs also tire quickly and need long breaks.Federal agents announced the $5,000 reward this week, but Lang said that amount may not push close friends or family to speak. He told the Daily Mail that rewards often need to be much higher to bring real tips.Travis Turner’s family lawyer, Adrian Collins, told the Daily Mail that Travis Turner left behind his car, keys, wallet, medication, glasses, and cash. Collins said Turner was not under arrest at the time and was not officially a fugitive when he vanished. His wife, Leslie Turner, later reported him missing to the Virginia State Police.Collins shared a message directed at Travis Turner, asking him to return home, face the charges in court, and think of his wife and children. For now, the woods remain silent, and the search continues with more questions than answers.Also Read: Travis Turner’s Family Breaks Silence With Fresh Details About The Former Coach’s Sudden Disappearance","Travis Turner, 46, vanished from his family home in Appalachia, Virginia, on November 20.

Q: Is career cushioning only for people in certain industries?

Q: How often should I review and update my career cushioning efforts?

Q: How do I know if my career cushioning efforts are working?

Q: How much time should I be dedicating to career cushioning?

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

'It's not our choice'

'The horse has already bolted'





MELBOURNE: Darcey Pritchard, 15, deleted Snapchat off her phone about a year ago when she felt sucked in by its algorithm.Her friend Luca Hagop, also 15, recently spent more than 34 hours on Instagram in one week, sharing pet videos and other reels ""so random, they're funny because they're so unfunny.""Amelie Tomlinson, 14, keeps up with her friends on Snapchat, and until recently, had almost no one's phone number.Her friend Jasmine Bentley, 15, is not allowed on any social media but dreams of being a content creator.The two sets of friends, living in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, Australia, offer a small window into the wildly different relationships today's teens have with social media. But they are united on one front: They do not think a new Australian law that bars children under 16 from having social media accounts, which takes effect Wednesday, will change their lives much.Australia passed the law a year ago, setting itself up to be a test case for what many parents say feels like this generation's Sisyphean task -- shielding children from the risks associated with social media until they are capable of navigating it responsibly.But these teenagers, born around the same time that Instagram and Snapchat were first released, are digital natives. Most know how to use VPNs, which may help them evade the ban.Many fudged their ages when they first signed up, to get around the minimum age of 13 for many social media services. Others have used their parents' information to get accounts, or have older siblings whose identities they can co-opt.More than anything, social media is just too deeply embedded into their lives.""It's how we communicate,"" Amelie said.Darcey said some of her friends had been talking about migrating to new apps. ""You're not going to stop these people,"" she said.In recent years, parents around the world have grappled with increasing alarm about social media's detriments to mental health, potential to enable online bullying and effects on developing brains.Australia was one of the first countries to pass a nationwide law to address those concerns. Last December, it set 16 as the minimum age for social media accounts, meaning hundreds of thousands of younger children would lose theirs. Other nations, like Malaysia, have followed suit with similar plans.Australia is putting the onus on the social media companies to keep younger children off their platforms and will not penalize parents or children who violate the law. Officials, including Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, have tried to tamp down expectations that the law will be an overnight fix.They say they are supporting parents who feel powerless against the lure of social media and peer pressure among teens. Anika Wells, the minister for communications, described an almost idyllic new reality with children awash in time for sports, baking or learning a new language.But it will be far from that simple. The lives and friendships of many 13- to 15-year-olds are enmeshed with social media -- even if the children are not on it themselves.For instance, when Darcey and her friends were playing an online guessing game, many of the clues were memes everyone else had seen on Instagram. When Amelie and a friend got to school 15 minutes before the first bell, they made four TikTok videos. When Jasmine puts on makeup, she will record herself, even though she is not on social media. And when Luca's mother died a few years ago, he found it helpful to type out his feelings on an anonymous server on Discord.Currently, 10 social media services are covered by the ban: Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, Twitch, X and YouTube. The companies have said that they do not believe a blanket ban is the best way to keep children safe, but that they will nevertheless deactivate accounts of children under 16.""They're ripping away something that has grown on us and become more part of our lives every day,"" Jasmine said.Two popular apps in Australia in the weeks leading up to the law were ""Yope,"" a photo sharing app targeting Generation Z, and ""lemon8,"" a TikTok alternative owned by the same parent company, ByteDance, portending a potential game of Whac-a-Mole with regulators.Luca jokes that Darcey lives under a ""1984"" regime when it comes to social media and phones, a nod to the all-controlling government in George Orwell's novel.Her parents have set daily time limits on apps for her and her two younger siblings -- for Darcey, five minutes on YouTube, 30 minutes for WhatsApp, 10 minutes on Spotify -- and ""downtime"" overnight.It is a careful equilibrium reached after many family discussions and a few charged, tearful fights. But it also means that after school on a recent afternoon, she spent hours talking to her father about her German homework, helping cook dinner and watching ""The Simpsons"" with her brothers, while her phone sat untouched in the designated spot on the kitchen counter. And when she found herself mindlessly scrolling on Snapchat, she herself decided to get off the app.Caroline and Joel Pritchard, Darcey's parents, said it seemed like a lonely uphill battle to restrict their children's phone usage.""It almost will feel like a bit of weight off our shoulders for the government to step in and go, hey, it's just banned,"" Joel Pritchard said. ""We can now turn around and say, 'Hey, it's not our choice.'""Darcey, who has been talking and thinking about social media's effects on her peers through her involvement in a youth-driven initiative called Project Rockit, said that limiting teenagers' use was only delaying the problem, and letting companies off the hook from making their platforms free of potentially harmful content.""It shouldn't be the user's fault,"" she said. ""The social media companies really need to take a bit more responsibility.""Luca, her friend since primary school, has always had free rein over his internet and phone use. He found a creative game building community on Discord -- which will not be affected by the law -- and enjoys science videos on YouTube.Instagram, he said, is just an easy pastime, which takes less effort than, say, setting up a board game. Even though at times he has felt ""trapped"" by its algorithm, he thinks he can outsmart it by shutting down the app when he sees videos he does not like.""Today I liked a few dog reels in a row, and then I got only dog videos for a few hours,"" he said on a recent afternoon, when he had stayed home sick from school.His father, Adrian Hagop, said he had always trusted that Luca and his older brother were mature and responsible enough to make their own decisions, and believed they should learn to deal with problems they may encounter online, rather than coddle them from unknown perils.His approach is to let them have those experiences and come to him to talk about it afterward if need be. Even after the ban, if Luca wants to be on social media, Hagop said he would help him get an account.""Both my kids are fairly skeptical, so I kind of trust them,"" he said. ""I think it depends on the kid.""When Amelie was trying to persuade her parents to allow her on TikTok, she pleaded her case in a five-page, single-spaced letter about not wanting to feel left out.Her mother, Catherine Best, said she felt that parents had lost control years ago. When Amelie had just started primary school, Best deleted YouTube off her daughter's school-required iPad because she was watching toy unboxing videos nonstop. The school insisted on reinstalling it because teachers used educational videos on YouTube in class.""That was really the gateway,"" said Best, who said the law was too little, too late. ""I feel like the horse has already bolted.""Amelie said that, like many of her friends, she had two TikTok accounts, both set to private: one for just close friends and the other for a wider group. The account with her friends has her age set to 19, so she was not worried about losing access.But she was exchanging phone numbers with friends for the first time in anticipation of losing her Snapchat account. This month, the app prompted her to verify her age -- set to 16 -- with a selfie, and it approved her as being old enough to continue using her account, she said.Amelie said she recognized how much she reached for her phone. Her screen time ""goes nuts"" on school holidays.""It's just an instinct to pick up my phone,"" she said, ""which I don't like.""Jasmine, a friend of Amelie's since the beginning of high school, said she felt like her generation's social media usage was misunderstood by grown-ups. Even though she is not on social media, her group of friends often film TikTok videos when they hang out.""There's a lot of creative freedom,"" she said. ""We're doing other things than just watching videos and scrolling, there's a lot more to it.""Her father, Craig Bentley, said even if Jasmine was inevitably exposed to social media, he felt better knowing she would always be with a friend, rather than scrolling on her own.Bentley, a high school teacher, said he had witnessed young minds shift as smartphones grew more pervasive, attention spans growing shorter and self-regulation dwindling.As for the law, he said, any effect would be for the better. At a minimum, he said, it will send the message that Australia will not stand for these apps taking control of a generation.""I hope there's a revolution against it and we all just decide it's not OK,"" he said.","Australian law bans children under 16 from having social media accounts. Many 13- to 15-year-olds are enmeshed with social media, even if the children are not on it themselves. Most know how to use VPNs, which may help them evade the ban.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125824452,imgsize-944823,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-68.jpg"

A city for everyone





Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has completed 595 new public bus passenger shelters across key locations, bringing the wider shelter project to about 89% completion of the target 762 units. The RTA says the rollout forms part of a long-term plan to modernise street-level public transport infrastructure and make waiting for buses more comfortable and reliable for everyone.The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in Dubai has reached a major milestone in modernizing the city’s public transport network, rolling out hundreds of state-of-the-art bus shelters. This ambitious initiative aims to construct a total of 762 sophisticated shelters by the end of 2025.To date, the project is near completion, with 595 shelters already installed, marking a substantial 89% overall progress. This upgrade is far more than an aesthetic facelift; it’s a pivotal step toward cultivating an integrated urban environment that supports sustainability and enhances the daily lives of residents and visitors.The strategic importance of this project is immense, as the bus network currently serves over 192 million passengers annually.To maximize efficiency and ridership, the RTA carefully selected locations based on future demand, high population density, and the need for integration with other ""soft mobility"" options. Many of the new stops are major hubs, designed to handle high volumes of traffic, with certain locations serving more than ten bus routes per shelter.The new shelters boast a sleek, contemporary aesthetic that perfectly complements Dubai’s modern architectural landscape. However, the true transformation lies in the user-friendly technology and comfort features integrated into the design.For stops classified as Primary Shelters (serving over 750 passengers daily), the RTA provides top-tier amenities:The RTA categorizes all 762 shelters into four tiers based on passenger volume to ensure appropriate amenity levels at every stop:In a move showcasing Dubai's focus on future technology, the RTA is also exploring the use of 3D printing technology for the construction of some shelters on a trial basis, blending functionality with cutting-edge innovation.H.E. Mattar Al Tayer, Director General and Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors of the RTA, emphasized the project's greater role, stating: “The new shelters represent a pivotal step in RTA's efforts to develop an integrated urban environment that encourages residents and visitors to use public transport, improves quality of life, and promotes comfort and well-being.”He added that ensuring the shelters combine modern design with services that guarantee a better mobility experience is key to reinforcing public confidence in the network and supporting long-term sustainability objectives, including emissions reduction.The initiative aligns with Dubai’s broader vision for inclusive urban development. The design of every new shelter is fully compliant with the Dubai Universal Design Code, ensuring complete accessibility for all community members. This focus includes dedicated, comfortable spaces specifically tailored for wheelchair users (People of Determination).This commitment to inclusivity supports the ""My Community … A City for Everyone"" initiative, launched by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai.",Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has completed 595 new public bus passenger shelters across key locations.

From the window of a commercial aircraft cruising above the Arctic Circle, the night sky transformed into something other-worldly. Curtains of glowing green light unfurled across the darkness as the northern lights — also known as the aurora borealis — put on a rare aerial performance over the polar ice.The aurora appears when charged particles released by the Sun crash into Earth’s atmosphere at tremendous speeds. Guided by the planet’s magnetic field, these solar particles collide with oxygen and nitrogen molecules high above the surface, triggering a brilliant light show. Oxygen glows green and red, while nitrogen shimmers in blues and purples, creating the surreal waves and spirals that make the aurora one of nature’s most hypnotic spectacles.Usually visible from ground locations near the Arctic Circle — such as Norway, Iceland, Alaska and northern Canada — the lights are shaped by solar storms occurring millions of kilometres away. When the Sun is particularly active, the auroras intensify, rippling faster, glowing brighter and spreading further south.Seen from 35,000 feet, however, the experience is transformed. With no city lights to interfere and clouds drifting below, the aurora appears closer, larger and more fluid — like luminous smoke pouring across the sky.From this vantage point, Earth’s curvature becomes visible, the frozen terrain stretches endlessly below, and the heavens seem to spill downward in moving colour.For passengers unaware of what awaited them beyond the glass, the flight was routine. But for those who looked out, it became unforgettable — a reminder that even in an age of GPS and jet engines, the sky still holds mysteries that no technology can tame.Above the pole, beneath the stars, the Earth quietly revealed one of its oldest secrets.","The northern lights — also known as the aurora borealis — put on a rare aerial performance over the polar ice.

UAE launches new one-step service to renew passport and emirates ID together – All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-launches-new-one-step-service-to-renew-passport-and-emirates-id-together-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125800645.cms,"Emiratis can now renew passports and Emirates ID together in one step via UAEICP app/Representative Image

One step renewal

Citizen driven design

Faster and efficient

Part of zero bureaucracy





In a major step towards seamless government services, the UAE has introduced a unified system that allows Emirati citizens to renew their passports and Emirates ID cards in a single, integrated process. The move, part of the “Zero Bureaucracy” initiative, promises to cut processing times, reduce administrative hurdles, and transform the way citizens manage key identity documents.The Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has launched a smart service enabling citizens to renew both passports and Emirates ID cards together. Previously, individuals had to complete separate applications for each document, navigate different forms, and make multiple payments. The new system consolidates all these steps into one seamless process via the UAEICP smart application.Citizens whose passports have expired and whose Emirates ID is due to expire within six months will now see an option to conveniently renew both documents on a single page within the app. The platform also allows users to easily update personal information and photographs without needing to re-enter data multiple times.The integrated renewal service directly addresses public concerns identified during the “Zero Bureaucracy Expo.” Many residents expressed frustration over managing different expiration dates for passports and ID cards, which often caused administrative confusion. By synchronizing the renewal process, the government ensures that citizens no longer have staggered expirations, simplifying document management.Officials highlighted that the system’s development was shaped by citizen input, evolving from a simple service improvement into a comprehensive smart solution. This reflects a broader commitment to responsive governance, where services are designed to meet the real needs of the public.The new unified platform is expected to cut processing times by at least 50 per cent while reducing inquiries and customer calls by around 40 per cent. It supports the national goal of simplifying procedures, improving government responsiveness, and delivering faster, more integrated services.By centralizing the management of all passports and identity documents for an entire family, the application represents a major leap forward in digital government services. The initiative prioritizes efficiency, quality, and tangible impact, leveraging technology and best practices to make citizens’ lives easier with minimal effort.This development forms part of the second phase of the Zero Government Bureaucracy (ZGB) Programme, launched in June by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai. The program aims to establish a world-leading model for government services, emphasizing proactive, user friendly, and fully integrated digital solutions.The unified passport and Emirates ID renewal service exemplifies the UAE government’s ongoing commitment to eliminating unnecessary administrative hurdles and creating a modern, citizen-centric public service environment.","UAE has introduced a unified system that allows Emirati citizens to renew their passports and Emirates ID cards in a single, integrated process.

Meet Dubai's Ferrari Purosangue Mansory

Strategic supercar policing

Beyond speed





Dubai Police has once again elevated its globally recognized luxury patrol fleet, unveiling an ultra-rare, customized Ferrari Purosangue Mansory, a 755-horsepower powerhouse that is one of only seven units modified worldwide. Marking 12 years of their strategic use of supercars, the Ministry of Interior confirmed the addition will be deployed in major tourist attractions like the Burj Khalifa to boost visibility, assist visitors, and underscore Dubai's commitment to security, innovation, and high-end excellence.Dubai Police has redefined luxury law enforcement once again by adding a highly customized Ferrari Purosangue Mansory to its world-famous fleet. This new patrol car is not just a high-performance vehicle; it is a global rarity, being one of only seven customized units of its kind in the entire world.The vehicle was specially modified by the German tuning house Mansory, giving it an aggressive yet sophisticated look perfectly suited for the streets of Dubai. The custom upgrades include a full carbon-fibre exterior kit, a sporty front bumper, a prominent rear wing, and custom forged FC.5 wheels.Inside, the cabin features a bespoke interior with premium leather and carbon-fibre trims, reflecting the city’s commitment to high-end excellence.The car’s performance is as impressive as its looks. This machine is powered by a massive 6.5-litre V12 engine, which produces an incredible 755 horsepower and 730Nm of torque. This power allows the patrol car to rocket from 0 to 100km/h in a mere 3.1 seconds and reach a top speed of 320km/h.The unveiling of the customized Ferrari took place at an anniversary event held in front of the iconic Emirates Towers. This celebration marked a significant milestone: 12 years of the Dubai Police’s luxury patrol fleet.The concept of using supercars for police patrols began in 2013 with the introduction of a Lamborghini, quickly turning the fleet into an international symbol of Dubai's innovative approach to security. Today, the luxury fleet has grown to an impressive 56 high-performance vehicles.The strategic purpose of these vehicles, including the new Ferrari, is not chase or speed, but enhanced visibility and global branding.Brigadier Saeed Al Hajri, Director of the General Department of Criminal Investigation, confirmed that the fleet reflects Dubai Police's commitment to innovation and service excellence. He stated that the new patrol will operate across major tourist hubs to assist visitors and strengthen community engagement.The luxury patrols are mobile service units, ensuring a highly visible and approachable presence where the police force can interact directly with residents and millions of visitors.The new Ferrari Purosangue Mansory will be immediately deployed in key tourist zones, including the Burj Khalifa, Mohammed bin Rashid Boulevard, and Jumeirah Beach Residence (JBR). By positioning these eye-catching cars in high-traffic areas, the police aim to bolster the sense of safety and showcase Dubai’s modern image.The fleet’s community role extends far beyond patrolling. Lieutenant Colonel Muhammad Abdulrahman noted that the patrol cars have participated in 1,184 events over the last three years. Crucially, they are also used to engage with the public on a personal level, having helped fulfil 49 wishes for children between 2023 and 2025, reinforcing the police’s focus on community happiness and positive interaction.","Dubai Police has redefined luxury law enforcement once again by adding a highly customized Ferrari Purosangue Mansory to its world-famous fleet.

Qatar begins digital selection process for Hajj 1447 AH pilgrims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/qatar-begins-digital-selection-process-for-hajj-1447-ah-pilgrims/articleshow/125718658.cms,"Qatar’s Hajj 1447 AH electronic selection notifies pilgrims via SMS, requiring seven-day registration with accredited operators/Representative Image

How the selection and registration works





New system upgrades and early registration





Quota, oversight, and support









Qatar is gearing up to welcome pilgrims for the Hajj 1447 AH season as the Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs (Awqaf) launches its electronic selection process. Starting December 2, 2025, the Hajj and Umrah Affairs Department will guide shortlisted applicants through a digital system designed to make registration smooth, transparent, and efficient. This initiative also gives operators the ability to plan trips effectively, ensuring top quality services for pilgrims.Pilgrims who are shortlisted will receive an SMS notifying them of their approval. Once notified, they have seven days to complete the registration process with one of the 24 accredited Hajj operators through the official website, www.hajj.gov.qa. Missing this deadline will result in automatic cancellation.During registration, applicants are required to pay an advance of QAR 10,000. This is part of the total Hajj cost, not a separate registration fee, and the final price depends on the services chosen, including accommodation and transportation. Pilgrims must also sign an electronic contract selecting their preferred operator through the online system.The advance payment ensures that applicants are serious about performing Hajj.It also helps operators plan their trips carefully, making sure all arrangements are ready for pilgrims’ arrival. Applicants are encouraged to review the services and costs of each operator, as they may vary in terms of residency, hospitality, and transportation.This year, the electronic system comes with a smoother online payment mechanism, allowing pilgrims to pay comfortably according to the prices set by their chosen operator. Building on the success of previous seasons, early registration is now open, giving operators the chance to finalize contracts and organize trips well in advance.These upgrades aim to provide a seamless pilgrimage experience. Pilgrims can focus on performing Hajj in a calm and organized setting while benefiting from high quality services.Qatar’s quota for this season is set at 4,400 pilgrims. The electronic selection process fully respects this allocation and follows established standards. Awqaf is working closely with the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah in Saudi Arabia, along with other relevant authorities, to ensure the pilgrimage runs smoothly and meets the expectations of Qatar’s pilgrims.For any questions about registration, selection, or services, pilgrims can contact the hotline at 132. The ministry emphasized that these coordinated efforts reflect its commitment to providing an organized, transparent, and fulfilling Hajj experience for all pilgrims from Qatar.","Qatar is gearing up to welcome pilgrims for the Hajj 1447 AH season.

Qatar's Hayya Visa upgrade

Two months and multiple entries

Extended Stay: Residents of GCC nations (including the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, and Kuwait) can now stay in Qatar for up to two months (60 days) on a single Hayya visa application. This extended duration provides ample time for visitors to explore cultural sites, natural attractions, and the packed calendar of year-round events.



Multiple-Entry Access: The new visa grants multiple-entry access. This means visitors can travel in and out of Qatar throughout the season without needing to reapply each time, greatly facilitating short, frequent trips for events or weekend getaways from neighboring countries.



What is the Hayya Platform?

Integrated Services: Hayya integrates visa processing with other essential travel elements, including event access, accommodation booking, transport planning, and general lifestyle services



Official Entry Document: Originally launched for the 2022 FIFA World Cup , the Hayya system successfully processed entry permits for millions of fans, and it continues to serve as the mandatory entry document for specified categories of visitors, including those utilizing the new GCC Resident Visa (A2).



Why did Qatar make the move?





From 30 November 2025, Qatar expanded the Hayya GCC Resident Visa (A2): eligible residents of GCC countries can now stay in Qatar for up to two months and enter the country multiple times during the visa’s validity. The update was announced by Qatar Tourism in coordination with the Ministry of Interior and the committee managing visitor entry as the country prepares for a busy winter of sports and cultural events.Qatar has rolled out significant enhancements to its Hayya GCC Residents Visa (Category A2), dramatically simplifying travel for expatriates living across the Gulf. These changes, which officially took effect on November 30, 2025, are specifically designed to support the expected surge in regional visitors and streamline entry during Qatar's busy season of international events.The updates, announced by Qatar Tourism in partnership with the Ministry of Interior, aim to reinforce the country’s position as a regional tourism hub. They mark a key moment for the Hayya platform, which serves as Qatar's official digital e-visa gateway, uniting visa processing with essential travel and lifestyle services into a single, comprehensive interface.The core of the Hayya update offers two major benefits that significantly improve flexibility and convenience for GCC residents:This updated system is engineered to ensure smoother entry through all ports of arrival, air, land, and sea, strengthening Qatar's operational readiness during peak visitor periods.The name ""Hayya"" (هَيّا) literally translates from Arabic to ""Let's Go!"" or ""Come On!"", perfectly reflecting its purpose as Qatar’s main facilitator for welcoming visitors.The platform is far more than just a visa application portal. It serves as Qatar's unified official digital e-visa gateway, designed to provide a seamless travel experience from the moment a visitor plans their trip:This comprehensive, digital-first approach embodies Qatar's vision to modernize its tourism sector and make entry into the country as efficient and appealing as possible.The timing of the Hayya upgrade is strategic, coinciding with a high-profile season of sports and cultural activities set to draw large crowds from the GCC region.The primary immediate driver is the 2025 FIFA Arab Cup. By simplifying access for regional fans, Qatar aims to maximize spectator numbers for this major tournament. The move also supports a vibrant line-up of surrounding cultural and entertainment events, encouraging attendees to extend their stays beyond the stadiums.Saeed Al Kuwari, Director of Hayya, emphasized that the new measures are more than just procedural tweaks. They reflect Qatar Tourism's ""broader vision to strengthen the country's openness to the region, facilitate visitor movement during major sports and cultural events, increase arrivals, and enhance tourism's contribution to the national economy.",Qatar has rolled out significant enhancements to its Hayya GCC Residents Visa (Category A2) Residents of GCC countries can now stay in Qatar for up to two months and enter the country multiple times during the visa’s validity.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets. The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Pensioners play a vital role in the social fabric of our society, and their financial security is paramount. To ensure continued access to pension benefits, annual life certificate submissions are mandatory for all pensioners. This process, which verifies the pensioner's living status, has been streamlined through various online and offline methods. With the recent initiatives to promote digital submissions, pensioners can conveniently fulfil this requirement and maintain their financial support.The requirement for pensioners to submit their jeevan pramaan patra is a critical process in ensuring the integrity and sustainability of pension funds. By providing multiple submission methods—both online and offline—the government is making it easier for pensioners to comply with this requirement. The ongoing digital campaigns further illustrate the government’s commitment to enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of pension services, ensuring that pensioners receive their benefits without unnecessary delays.The submission window for life certificates opened on November 1 for pensioners under the age of 80. This is part of an annual cycle during which pensioners must reaffirm their eligibility for pension disbursement. The deadline for submitting the life certificate is November 30. If the certificate is not submitted by this deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting in December. This requirement also applies to super senior citizens (aged 80 and above), who were allowed to submit their certificates starting on October 1, with the same November 30 deadline.Pensioners can submit their life certificates through several methods, accommodating various preferences and technological capabilities. Here are the options available:For those choosing to submit their life certificates online through the Jeevan Pramaan Portal, the following steps are involved:For pensioners opting for offline submission, the process is straightforward:If pensioners fail to submit their life certificates by the stipulated deadline, their pension payments will be halted starting the following month. However, payments will resume once the life certificate is submitted, thereby ensuring that pensioners do not permanently lose access to their funds, provided they complete the required process.In an effort to facilitate the submission process, the Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare (DoPPW) has initiated its third nationwide digital life certificate (DLC) campaign. This campaign runs from November 1 to November 30, covering 800 cities and districts. The campaign aims to promote the use of digital platforms for certificate submission, ensuring greater accessibility for pensioners.On the first day of this campaign, over 1.8 lakh pensioners successfully generated their digital life certificates, highlighting the growing adoption of technology among pensioners. This indicates a positive trend towards digitalization and the effective use of biometric authentication methods.A life certificate is an official document that verifies a pensioner's living status, required annually to continue receiving pension benefits.All pensioners, including family pensioners, must submit a life certificate to maintain their pension payments.Pensioners under 80 must submit their life certificate between November 1 and November 30 each year.

Meet Charlie Javice: Woman who scammed JP Morgan for $175M — but the bank is paying her $142M legal bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meet-charlie-javice-woman-who-scammed-jp-morgan-for-175m-but-the-bank-is-paying-her-142m-legal-bills/articleshow/125369591.cms,"How a startup deal turned into a massive fraud

A conviction that didn’t stop the bills

The controversial expenses

Why JPMorgan cannot simply stop paying

Charlie Javice’s story sounds almost too bizarre to be real: a young fintech founder who tricked JPMorgan into buying her startup for $175 million, ended up convicted of fraud, and is now serving a prison sentence, yet the same company she scammed is still paying more than $142 million for her legal bills, including questionable expenses like luxury hotel upgrades and “cellulite butter. ”Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid. When JPMorgan considered acquiring the startup in 2021, she reportedly presented the bank with millions of supposed student user accounts. Prosecutors later revealed that these numbers had been fabricated, with Javice allegedly hiring a data scientist to generate fake profiles to inflate Frank’s value.JPMorgan completed the acquisition believing Frank had more than four million users, only to discover after the deal that the platform had a tiny fraction of that. The bank alerted authorities, and by 2023 Javice was arrested on federal fraud charges.In March 2025, Javice was convicted of multiple fraud counts and sentenced to more than seven years in prison. But here’s where the story takes an unusual twist: despite defrauding the bank, she is still allowed to bill JPMorgan for her legal defence because of an indemnification clause included in the acquisition agreement.This contractual protection, which is common in startup buyouts, requires JPMorgan to cover certain legal costs for former executives of Frank.As a result, the bank has already paid over $142 million in defence expenses for Javice and her former colleague Olivier Amar.The clause itself is a standard feature in mergers, designed to protect executives from being financially ruined by lawsuits connected to their time at the company. In normal situations, it is meant to ensure fairness and prevent frivolous legal targeting after an acquisition. But in this case, it has trapped JPMorgan in a bizarre obligation: they must keep funding the defence of someone who defrauded them.Had the bank conducted even a simple, early-stage verification of Frank’s user data—such as requesting direct access to the platform’s actual customer records or running a basic audit—this entire dispute could have been avoided. Instead, delayed due diligence and overconfidence in the startup’s claims set the stage for a costly legal mess that continues years after the fraud was uncovered.JPMorgan’s frustration has grown as the legal bills have ballooned. The bank claims the expenses submitted include personal items such as cellulite butter, first-class travel upgrades, and hotel luxuries. Its lawyers argue that the billing records contain “extreme abuses,” including claims for work hours that seem physically impossible.Javice’s spokesperson denies that she personally submitted these questionable charges, stating that her legal team is responsible for all billing decisions.Even though Javice has already been convicted, she is now appealing her case, and the indemnification clause means the bank must continue paying her legal fees unless a court orders otherwise. JPMorgan is currently trying to convince a Delaware judge to halt these payments, arguing that the system is being misused.The saga has become a major lesson in the risks of fast-paced startup acquisitions. JPMorgan’s failure to properly verify Frank’s user base before buying the company has left it entangled in one of the most embarrassing and expensive due diligence failures in recent corporate history.","Charlie Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid.

Advice for students





Geoffrey Hinton declares the winner in ChatGPT vs Google Gemini fight









Geoffrey Hinton, widely known as the ‘Godfather of AI’ has once again shared an advice for engineers and students. Hinton has asked the students and engineers to not give up computer science degrees, despite the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence which is reshaping the coding industry. Speaking to Business Insider in an interview Hinton stressed on the fact that computer science degree is not limited to just programming. “Many people think a CS degree is just programming or something. Obviously, just being a competent mid-level programmer is not going to be a career for much longer, because AI can do that,” he said.Hinton also argued that the discipline teaches foundational skills in systems thinking, mathematics, and problem-solving which will remain relevant for decades to come. “A CS degree will be valuable for quite a long time,” Hinton added.Along with this, Hinton has also encouraged the middle and high school students to learn coding, likening it to studying Latin in the humanities. “You’re never going to speak Latin, but it’s still useful learning Latin,” said Hinton. He further emphasised that coding is will remain a valuable intellectual exercise even if AI used for automating most of the work.Sharing an advice for aspiring AI researchers and engineers, Hinton mentioned that they should focus on critical thinking and core mathematical skills. “Some skills that are always going to be valuable, like knowing some math, statistics, probability theory, and linear algebra. That’s not knowledge that’s going to disappear,” he said.Recently, Hinton revealed that he believes Google is catching up with OpenAI in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. Hinton, a professor emeritus at the University of Toronto and former Google Brain expert, also said he is surprised that Google took this long to surpass its competitors. In an interview with Business Insider, when discussing Google's position relative to OpenAI, Hinton said, ""I think it's actually more surprising than it's taken this long for Google to overtake OpenAI. I think that right now they're beginning to overtake it""This declaration follows the widely praised launch of Google's Gemini 3, an update that many in the tech world believe has elevated the company above OpenAI's GPT-5.","Geoffrey Hinton, widely known as the ‘Godfather of AI’ has once again shared an advice for engineers and students.

A new rule aimed at discouraging entities like hotels and event organisers from taking photocopies of customers' Aadhaar cards and storing them in physical form will be published soon, a senior government official said. Such practices are in contravention of the present Aadhaar Act. Unique Identification Authority of India ( UIDAI ) CEO Bhuvnesh Kumar told PTI that the authority has approved a new rule mandating the registration of entities that seek Aadhaar-based verification. This will provide them access to new technology enabling identity verification by scanning a QR code or connecting with a new Aadhaar app currently in the works.""The new rule has been approved by the authority and will be notified soon. It will mandate registration of offline verification-seeking entities like hotels, event organisers. The objective is to discourage paper-based Aadhaar verification,"" Kumar told PTI. The new verification process is expected to resolve issues related to service disruptions caused by the downtime of intermediate servers connecting to the central Aadhaar database.According to the official, entities seeking offline verification will be granted access to an API (application programming interface), allowing them to update their systems for seamless Aadhaar verification.UIDAI is currently beta-testing a new app designed to facilitate app-to-app verification. This method eliminates the need to connect to the central Aadhaar database server for every transaction. The new app is versatile and can be utilized at various touchpoints, including airports and shops requiring age verification for specific products.""The ease of verification will enhance offline verification without the use of paper while maintaining privacy of users or any risk of their Aadhaar data getting leaked for misuse,"" Kumar said.The official added that the new app is expected to finetune Aadhaar authentication services in alignment with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, which is set to become fully operational in 18 months.Additionally, the app will empower users to update address proof documents directly and add family members who do not possess a mobile phone to the same app.",A new rule aimed at discouraging entities like hotels and event organisers from taking photocopies of customers' Aadhaar cards and storing them in physical form will be published soon.

Canadian Police testing once controversial AI-powered facial recognition body cameras,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/canadian-police-testing-once-controversial-ai-powered-facial-recognition-body-cameras/articleshow/125820491.cms,"Representative AI Image





In a significant test of policing technology that could reshape law enforcement strategies across North America, police in Edmonton have begun a live pilot program using body cameras equipped with facial recognition AI.According to a report by The Associated Press, the cameras have been trained to detect the faces of approximately 7,000 individuals on a ""high risk"" watch list. This move marks a major pivot for the technology provider, Axon Enterprise, Inc., which famously halted facial recognition development six years ago due to ethical concerns.The Pilot Program The pilot, which launched last week, involves about 50 officers in Edmonton, a city of over 1 million people. The technology scans for individuals categorized as ""flagged or caution"" for violent offenses, weapons possession, escape risks, or outstanding serious warrants.Kurt Martin, acting superintendent of the Edmonton Police Service, noted that the current watch list includes 6,341 high-risk offenders and an additional 724 individuals with serious criminal warrants.However, during this ""proof of concept"" phase—which runs through December—officers will not receive real-time alerts.Instead, the data will be analyzed retroactively at the station. Axon CEO Rick Smith described the initiative not as a product launch, but as ""early-stage field research"" designed to test the technology in real-world conditions, including Edmonton’s limited daylight and cold winter temperatures.Ethical Concerns and Internal Pushback The deployment has drawn sharp criticism from privacy advocates and former Axon advisors. Barry Friedman, a law professor at NYU and former chair of Axon’s AI ethics board, told the AP that the company is proceeding without sufficient public debate or expert vetting.""It's essential not to use these technologies, which have very real costs and risks, unless there's some clear indication of the benefits,"" Friedman said. He resigned from Axon’s board in 2022 following a separate dispute over Taser-equipped drones.Axon acknowledged to the AP that facial recognition systems can still struggle with accuracy regarding ""distance, lighting and angle,"" factors that can ""disproportionately impact accuracy for darker-skinned individuals."" The company stated that human review is required for every match.Global Context and Competition The pilot arrives as global attitudes toward facial recognition diverge. The European Union has largely banned real-time public face scanning, whereas the United Kingdom has utilized it to make 1,300 arrests in the last two years.In the U.S., major competitors like Motorola Solutions have abstained from deploying real-time identification, citing ethical principles. However, Axon—the dominant U.S. supplier of body cameras—hopes the data gathered in Canada will help strengthen oversight frameworks for future use in the United States.Temitope Oriola, a criminology professor at the University of Alberta, described Edmonton as a ""laboratory"" for the tool. Given the police service's sometimes ""frosty"" relationship with Indigenous and Black communities, Oriola noted it remains to be seen if the technology will improve safety or exacerbate tensions.","Police in Edmonton have begun a pilot program using body cameras equipped with facial recognition AI.

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

"Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal teases ‘Temple’ device, calls it ‘world class’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zomato-ceo-deepinder-goyal-teases-temple-device-calls-it-world-class/articleshow/125816235.cms,"What is Temple



Hey Shubham, wrong on one count, and right on others -

While conducting research on the

Gravity Aging Hypothesis

, we had to make an experimental device to calculate Brain Flow accurately, real-time, and continuously. Been using it for a year, and I’ve been feeling that this could shape into an important wearable the world needs. Brain Flow is already well accepted as a biomarker for aging, longevity as well as cognition. So this device is useful and relevant even if the Gravity Aging Hypothesis turns out to be wrong.

And Temple is going to be a small cute company, if at all. Nothing compared to Eternal.

PS: We didn’t “cook up” the Gravity Aging Hypothesis to sell Temple. Not my game to lose the trust our customers have in me over a marketing gimmick.

I did not explain the Gravity Aging Hypothesis (GAH) well, the first time.

I brought my consumer internet brain into a deep scientific field and I miscommunicated. I tried to compress years of research and thinking into a dramatic social media reveal.

That made the hypothesis sound absolute and commercial – while it’s really not.

I apologise.

This is me taking a slower, cleaner shot at explaining GAH, without oversimplifying it.





Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal has announced that Temple, the ‘mysterious’ tiny device recently spotted on his right temple, is coming soon. It is an experimental monitor and Goyal called “world class”. The device has been created as part of his research into his recently publicised and unconventional “Gravity Aging Hypothesis,” which claims that gravity may contribute to the human aging process by potentially reducing blood flow to the brain.“Coming Soon. Follow @temple for more updates,” Goyal said. While replying to a comment on his post, he called the device “World class, to say the least.”Last month, Goyal cleared up the speculation surrounding the device in a response to a post on LinkedIn. He explained that Temple is an: “experimental device to calculate Brain Flow accurately, real-time, and continuously.” The development of the device is directly linked to Goyal's research into his hypothesis. The Zomato CEO outlined the idea, which he described as “scientific yet unconventional,” suggesting that gravity shortens lifespan.“I’m not sharing this as the CEO of Eternal, but as a fellow human, curious enough to follow a strange thread... Newton gave us a word for it. Einstein said it bends spacetime. I am saying gravity shortens lifespan,” Goyal wrote in introducing the theory.The new device appears to be the first hardware manifestation of Goyal's deep personal interest in longevity and anti-aging research. He said:In separate post, he noted:","Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal has announced that Temple, the ‘mysterious’ tiny device recently spotted on his right temple, is coming soon.
