What OpenAI says





Elon Musk-owned AI software company, xAI has filed a lawsuit against Sam Altman-led OpenAI , accusing it of stealing its trade secrets. The lawsuit, filed in a federal court in California, says that OpenAI was engaged in a “deeply troubling pattern” of hiring away former xAI employees to gain access to trade secrets. It further accuses OpenAI of pursuing unfair advantage in the AI race. In the lawsuit, xAI names four former engineers – Xuechen Li who is involved in a separate trade secrets lawsuit, Jimmy Fraiture and a senior finance executive.“OpenAI is targeting those individuals with knowledge of xAI’s key technologies and business plans, including xAI’s source code and its operational advantages in launching data centers, then inducing those employees to breach their confidentiality and other obligations to xAI through unlawful means,” the lawsuit states.“By hook or by crook, OpenAI clearly will do anything when threatened by a better innovator, including plundering and misappropriating the technical advancements, source code, and business plans of xAI,” the lawsuit claims.“OpenAI is not merely soliciting or hiring a competitor’s employees. OpenAI is waging a coordinated, unfair, and unlawful campaign: OpenAI is targeting those individuals with knowledge of xAI’s key technologies and business plans—including xAI’s source code and its operational advantages in launching data centers—then inducing those employees to breach their confidentiality and other obligations to xAI through unlawful means,” it states.OpenAI has rejected the allegations, dismissing the lawsuit as “the latest chapter in Mr. Musk’s ongoing harassment.”Notably, Elon Musk has had a complex relationship with OpenAI — from co-founding the company with Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, to becoming one of its strongest critics and now a business rival.In August, Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Apple, accusing Apple of giving ChatGPT preferential treatment in App Store rankings.Musk has also taken OpenAI to court, alleging it put profits ahead of its original mission of developing AI for humanity’s benefit. OpenAI, in turn, has countersued Musk, accusing him of harassment."," xAI has filed a lawsuit against Sam Altman-led OpenAI, accusing it of stealing its trade secrets.

About Dubai police Anti-Fraud Department







The Anti-Fraud Department at the General Department of Criminal Investigation in Dubai Police have issued an urgent warning about a new and growing online scam spreading through search engines and social media. Fraudsters are creating fake websites that impersonate official “Consumer Protection” platforms. By tricking victims into visiting these sites, scammers gain access to mobile data via malicious “remote access” applications, enabling them to carry out unauthorized financial transactions.Dubai Police explained that when a victim searches for a consumer protection platform to file a complaint, they may be misled into entering their personal details – such as name, email, phone number, and complaint description – on one of these fraudulent websites. The scammer then contacts the victim directly, posing as an official employee, and repeats the details of the complaint to appear credible.Once trust is established, the fraudster instructs the victim to download remote control software and simultaneously log in to their bank account. This allows the scammer to view the victim’s phone screen in real time, steal sensitive banking information, and carry out illegal transfers or purchases.Dubai Police stressed that these malicious applications are specifically designed to mirror the content of the victim’s device, granting full control to the fraudster. This exposes confidential data and enables its unlawful use.The force urged the public to only use official consumer protection channels, avoid downloading suspicious applications, and never share banking information with unauthorised parties.Dubai Police further urged immediate reporting of such attempts through the eCrime platform or by calling 901, to safeguard personal data and finances.The Anti-Fraud Department of Dubai Police was formally established as part of the General Department of Criminal Investigation to specifically combat financial crimes and scams. Over the past decade, it has grown into a sophisticated unit employing advanced forensic and digital technologies to track, investigate, and dismantle complex fraud networks, including cyber-enabled financial fraud, identity theft, and money laundering. This department uses biometric tools, data recovery, and international cooperation to tackle crimes, often involving high-value thefts such as gold and credit card scams.It also addresses emerging threats like AI-assisted fraud and fake online businesses, ensuring Dubai’s financial system remains secure by rapidly uncovering fraud schemes and arresting perpetrators. The department actively raises public awareness of fraud risks and encourages reporting to protect citizens and businesses alike.","Fraudsters create fake ‘Consumer Protection’ websites, luring users into downloading malicious apps that mirror their screens and steal banking data.

The UAE Media Council has reiterated its strict stance on the misuse of artificial intelligence in media content, especially in depictions involving national symbols or public figures. Amid growing global concerns around AI-generated misinformation, the Council is bolstering its regulatory framework to uphold ethical standards, preserve national identity, and ensure responsible digital communication.The UAE Media Council has clearly stated that using artificial intelligence (AI) or similar modern technologies to generate content involving national symbols or public figures without prior official approval is a direct violation of media content laws.This reminder comes in the wake of a recent social media incident where a user posted an AI-generated image featuring herself alongside the UAE’s founding father, Sheikh Zayed Al Nahyan. The post drew strong criticism online, with many users calling it ""distasteful"" and “unnecessary.”According to the Media Council, such acts not only misrepresent public figures but also disrespect the nation’s identity and values.Violations of this nature fall under the UAE’s Media Violations Regulation and may result in fines and administrative penalties.In a formal advisory, the UAE Media Council warned all social media users, media entities, and content creators to adhere strictly to approved laws and standards when using digital tools and AI technologies.The Council outlined several key AI-related media offences, including:Such actions are classified as media offences and are punishable under the Media Violations Regulation.The Council also emphasised the importance of professional and ethical responsibility, particularly as the media landscape becomes increasingly shaped by generative technologies. This includes a clear directive that no AI-generated content involving national symbols can be published or circulated without prior official consent.In May 2025, the UAE Media Council signed a strategic agreement with Presight, a global AI-powered big data firm, to develop a new regulatory platform.

Dubai launches global AI film competition



How creators can compete for the $1 million prize



Registration Start Date: 23 September 2025

Deadline: 20 November 2025

Eligibility and themes: What the rules really say

Who Can Enter: Open to creators worldwide. Only individual creators may apply (though teams can support the work) and entrants must be active social media content creators. Corporate or institutional entries are not allowed

Film Duration & Technical Formatting: Video length should be 7–10 minutes. Any language is allowed, but English subtitles are mandatory. Professional editing and clear sound quality required and subtitles must be accurate and properly synced



AI Tool Usage & Requirements: At least 70% of the film must be AI-generated. Participants Must use Google Gemini tools (Veo, Imagen, Flow) as the main AI engine. Other tools may be used for sound, editing, or minor visuals. Entrants may need to show which sections were created using Gemini.



Themes to Choose From: “Rewrite Tomorrow” (envisioning a hopeful or alternative future) or “The Secret Life Of” (revealing hidden stories behind everyday life) Entries must strictly align with one theme.





From entry rules to winner announcement - Timeline

Prize Money and Global Exposure for Winners

Grand Prize: $1,000,000 for the best AI film.



Finalist Benefits: The top 5 films will premiere at the 1 Billion Followers Summit before tens of thousands of creators, investors, and media leaders.



Industry Recognition: Winners and finalists gain exposure across international platforms and join Dubai’s growing Dh50 million creators accelerator fund ecosystem.

What you should pay attention to

Balancing AI and human input: Although AI must generate at least 70%, human creativity still has to shape the film, the storytelling, voice, editing, composition. AI tools are enablers, not replacements.



Ethical transparency: Be clear about which Gemini tools you used and how. If you use other tools or external footage, cite or document them. In some sources they say you may be asked to supply open files.



Theme execution over superficial references: It’s not enough to attach a theme name. Judges will look for depth — does your film really “rewrite tomorrow” with new ideas, or does it just slap on futuristic visuals? Does “The Secret Life Of” go deeper than just showing something hidden does it evoke empathy, surprise, insight?



Language / subtitles: English subtitles are required even if your dialogue is in another language. Poor subtitle translation or missing subtitles can hurt.



One entry per individual: While some sources say one entry per individual, others allow multiple entries (but maybe in different genres?). You’ll need to double-check this in the full criteria.



Public vote matters: Being shortlisted means you’ll go through public voting. So a film that appeals to audiences (not just art/AI enthusiasts) may have an edge. Think about clarity, emotional hook, shareability.

In a big cheer at the start of the festive season, the next generation GST reforms announced by the Modi government come into effect today, on September 22, 2025.From today, a plethora of household items, cars, TVs, bikes will become cheaper for the common man and middle class. Many food items have been moved to the NIL or 0% tax bracket. These include roti, parantha, paneer, khakra etc. Importantly, health and life insurance premiums will be exempt from GST.The new GST rates, first announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman earlier this month, reduce the tax slabs to two broad rates - 5% and 18%. While most items under GST have seen rate cuts, some limited items will now also be dearer with higher tax rates - such as clothes priced above Rs 2,500 will now attract a higher GST rate of 18% compared to 12% before.Ahead of the GST rate cuts becoming effective, PM Narendra Modi addressed the nation saying, “With sunrise on September 22nd, the first day of Navratri, the Next Generation GST reforms will come into effect.In a way, a GST savings festival is going to begin in the country from tomorrow. This GST Savings Festival will increase your savings, and you'll be able to purchase the things you want more easily. The poor, middle class people, neo middle class, youth, farmers, women, shopkeepers, businessmen, entrepreneurs of our country, everyone will benefit a lot from this savings festival. ”“Due to reduction in GST, it will now be easier for the citizens of the country to fulfill their dreams. Be it building a house, buying a TV, a refrigerator, or buying a scooter, bike, or a car, you'll have to spend less on all of these. Travelling will also become cheaper for you, as GST has been reduced on rooms in most hotels,” he added.","New GST rates effective today: 0%, 5%, 18% & 40% Tax Brackets. The 40% tax is for goods that are either categorized as sin or luxury. Below is a full list of items that now attract 0, 5, 18% and 40%.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124031450,imgsize-61380,width-400,resizemode-4/new-gst-rates-2025-full-list.jpg"

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Pensioners play a vital role in the social fabric of our society, and their financial security is paramount. To ensure continued access to pension benefits, annual life certificate submissions are mandatory for all pensioners. This process, which verifies the pensioner's living status, has been streamlined through various online and offline methods. With the recent initiatives to promote digital submissions, pensioners can conveniently fulfil this requirement and maintain their financial support.The requirement for pensioners to submit their jeevan pramaan patra is a critical process in ensuring the integrity and sustainability of pension funds. By providing multiple submission methods—both online and offline—the government is making it easier for pensioners to comply with this requirement. The ongoing digital campaigns further illustrate the government’s commitment to enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of pension services, ensuring that pensioners receive their benefits without unnecessary delays.The submission window for life certificates opened on November 1 for pensioners under the age of 80. This is part of an annual cycle during which pensioners must reaffirm their eligibility for pension disbursement. The deadline for submitting the life certificate is November 30. If the certificate is not submitted by this deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting in December. This requirement also applies to super senior citizens (aged 80 and above), who were allowed to submit their certificates starting on October 1, with the same November 30 deadline.Pensioners can submit their life certificates through several methods, accommodating various preferences and technological capabilities. Here are the options available:For those choosing to submit their life certificates online through the Jeevan Pramaan Portal, the following steps are involved:For pensioners opting for offline submission, the process is straightforward:If pensioners fail to submit their life certificates by the stipulated deadline, their pension payments will be halted starting the following month. However, payments will resume once the life certificate is submitted, thereby ensuring that pensioners do not permanently lose access to their funds, provided they complete the required process.In an effort to facilitate the submission process, the Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare (DoPPW) has initiated its third nationwide digital life certificate (DLC) campaign. This campaign runs from November 1 to November 30, covering 800 cities and districts. The campaign aims to promote the use of digital platforms for certificate submission, ensuring greater accessibility for pensioners.On the first day of this campaign, over 1.8 lakh pensioners successfully generated their digital life certificates, highlighting the growing adoption of technology among pensioners. This indicates a positive trend towards digitalization and the effective use of biometric authentication methods.A life certificate is an official document that verifies a pensioner's living status, required annually to continue receiving pension benefits.All pensioners, including family pensioners, must submit a life certificate to maintain their pension payments.Pensioners under 80 must submit their life certificate between November 1 and November 30 each year. Super senior citizens (80 and above) can submit theirs starting from October 1, with the same deadline.If the life certificate is not submitted by the deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting the following month.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online via the Jeevan Pramaan portal, through doorstep banking agents, using biometric devices at post offices, or in person at bank branches.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online by using the Jeevan Pramaan portal and completing biometric verification through designated apps.Yes, pensioners can submit their life certificates in person at their respective banks or post offices.Generally, you will need your Aadhaar number for biometric verification, along with any other identification or pension-related documents as required by your pension disbursing authority.Pensioners can check the status of their life certificate submission through the Jeevan Pramaan portal or by contacting their bank or pension disbursing authority.Yes, if your submission fails, you can reapply and submit your life certificate again using the same methods available to you.",Submission window for 'Jeevan Pramaan Patra' opens for pensioners under 80 with a deadline of November 30.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

My favourite ChatGPT feature so far: Sam Altman introduces user insights tool Pulse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/my-favourite-chatgpt-feature-so-far-sam-altman-introduces-user-insights-tool-pulse/articleshow/124164625.cms,"Representative Image

What Sam Altman said about ChatGPT’s new Pulse tool



“Today we are launching my favorite feature of ChatGPT so far, called Pulse. It is initially available to Pro subscribers.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Pulse works for you overnight, and keeps thinking about your interests, your connected data, your recent chats, and more. Every morning, you get a custom-generated set of stuff you might be interested in.

It performs super well if you tell ChatGPT more about what's important to you. In regular chat, you could mention “I’d like to go visit Bora Bora someday” or “My kid is 6 months old and I’m interested in developmental milestones” and in the future you might get useful updates.

Think of treating ChatGPT like a super-competent personal assistant: sometimes you ask for things you need in the moment, but if you share general preferences, it will do a good job for you proactively.

This also points to what I believe is the future of ChatGPT: a shift from being all reactive to being significantly proactive, and extremely personalized.

This is an early look, and right now only available to Pro subscribers. We will work hard to improve the quality over time and to find a way to bring it to Plus subscribers too.

Huge congrats to @ChristinaHartW, @_samirism, and the team for building this.”

Apple’s response to the lawsuit over delayed Siri features





Apple has asked a US court to dismiss a consolidated class action lawsuit over delayed Siri features, reports MacRumours citing court documents reviewed by it. The lawsuit claims that Apple misled customers with marketing for the iPhone 16, which promoted upcoming Siri features powered by Apple Intelligence. Plaintiffs said they would not have purchased the iPhone 16, or would have paid less, if they had known the features would be delayed.The case, Landsheft v. Apple Inc., is being heard in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.Apple’s lawyers argued that the lawsuit is unfounded because only two Siri features—contextual awareness and in-app controls—were delayed. “Plaintiffs complain about the timing of release of two features, despite the near-two dozen Apple Intelligence features that have already been delivered,” the lawyers said. “This limited delay cannot support Plaintiffs' sweeping claims.”The lawyers also said the delayed features do not amount to a breach of warranty.“By purchasing an iPhone 16, all of the plaintiffs have benefitted from camera improvements, enhanced silicon and increased performance, upgraded displays, and numerous other hardware and software improvements, including more than 20 Apple Intelligence features that were already available prior to the lawsuit,” they added.Apple first announced the personalized Siri features at its WWDC 2024 keynote, highlighting better understanding of a user’s personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls. The company later said in March that the features would be delayed, with CEO Tim Cook noting in July that Apple was “making good progress” and aimed to release them “next year.”Apple advertised the features through product presentations, its website, and a TV commercial featuring actor Bella Ramsey. The company is reportedly planning to release the features in iOS 26.4, expected in March or April 2026.","Apple has asked a US court to dismiss a consolidated class action lawsuit over delayed Siri features.

Understanding the language of software enhances AI precision and results



Message for today’s teens



Also Read |





Teens today may be standing on the brink of a transformative era in technology. Alexandr Wang, the 28-year-old co-founder of Scale AI—currently valued at $29 billion—believes that mastering artificial intelligence (AI) coding tools can provide an unprecedented opportunity for the next generation to shape the future. Speaking on the TBPN podcast , Wang encouraged young people to dedicate themselves fully to what he calls “vibe coding,” a practice of exploring AI tools in-depth to gain a competitive edge.“This is an incredible moment of discontinuity,” Wang explained. “If you just happen to spend, like, 10,000 hours playing with the tools and figuring out how to use them better than other people, that’s a huge advantage.”Wang draws a parallel between the current AI revolution and the early days of personal computing, when a teenage Bill Gates would secretly practice programming late at night. Just as Gates turned his early exposure to computers into a global technology empire with Microsoft, Wang believes today’s teens can leave their mark by immersing themselves in AI development.“That moment is happening right now,” Wang said. “If you are 13 years old, you should spend all of your time vibe coding. That’s how you should live your life.” His message is clear: AI fluency could become the defining skill of this generation.Despite his enthusiasm, Wang acknowledged that AI models may be capable of generating nearly all the code he has written in his career within the next five years. This has understandably sparked concerns about the future of programming careers, as companies increasingly adopt AI-powered coding assistants that can reduce reliance on human developers.However, industry leaders argue that coding will not become irrelevant. Andrew Ng, co-founder of Google Brain, emphasized in a March 2025 LinkedIn post that discouraging people from learning to code is “some of the worst career advice ever given.” He noted that as coding becomes more accessible through AI, it is even more critical for individuals to develop programming skills.Ng frames coding as a fundamental skill for the AI age. Understanding the “language of software” allows users to guide AI tools with precision, producing superior results compared to vague prompts. This concept is akin to how artists familiar with art history achieve better outcomes with AI-driven art tools; knowledge and fluency amplify creative potential.For Wang, who Forbes estimates to be worth $3.2 billion and who has recently been appointed Meta’s chief AI officer, the path to breakthroughs is clear: the earlier one immerses in AI coding, the greater the advantage.For today’s 13-year-olds and young learners, Wang’s advice is unmistakable: dedicate your hours to mastering AI coding tools and developing deep technical fluency. This could be the defining “Bill Gates moment” for Generation Z—a chance to transform early exploration into lasting technological impact.","Alexandr Wang, the 28-year-old co-founder of Scale AI, believes that mastering artificial intelligence (AI) coding tools can provide an unprecedented opportunity for the next generation to shape the future.

"Microsoft moves 'further away' from OpenAI, adds Anthropic AI model to Copilot assistant",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-moves-further-away-from-openai-adds-anthropic-ai-model-to-copilot-assistant/articleshow/124124338.cms,"How can Microsoft 365 Copilot assistant users access Anthropic’s models



“And stay tuned: Anthropic models will bring even more powerful experiences to Microsoft 365 Copilot.”

How Microsoft and OpenAI are reducing dependency on each other



Google hits $3 trillion: How Alphabet became the fastest to reach the milestone





Microsoft has begun diversifying its AI technology by integrating a model from Anthropic into its 365 Copilot assistant. The Amazon and Google-backed AI startup is a key rival to Microsoft’s principal partner, OpenAI . The software giant recently announced that it will start using the Anthropic model to answer some queries for its commercial clients. This move signals a shift in Microsoft's generative AI strategy, which has historically relied almost exclusively on OpenAI models for features across products like Bing and Windows. Microsoft is the lead investor in OpenAI, having committed more than $13 billion as part of its strategic partnership.Anthropic’s model is set to debut in Researcher, a Microsoft 365 Copilot agent that helps collect information, analyse it, and create reports.Employees in organisations that are part of Microsoft’s Frontier program, which gives early access to AI tools, can now opt to use Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.1 reasoning model.This model is built to handle complex tasks and serves as an alternative to OpenAI’s offering within Researcher.In a blog post, Charles Lamanna, Microsoft’s president of business and industry Copilot, wrote:Corporate customers can now choose Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4 and Claude Opus 4.1 when creating custom AI agents using Microsoft’s Copilot Studio.However, administrators will need to enable Anthropic models before employees can access them. These models operate on Amazon and Google cloud platforms and are governed by Anthropic’s terms and conditions, Lamanna noted.Alongside adding models from outside partners, Microsoft has also begun testing MAI-1-preview, its own in-house large language model.OpenAI has been actively building partnerships with major players. In recent weeks, it announced plans to spend $300 billion with Oracle and signed a $10 billion deal with chip designer Broadcom. This week, Nvidia revealed it will invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a joint push to develop massive new data centres.While Microsoft and OpenAI continue to work closely, their relationship is shifting. Last year, Microsoft announced that GitHub Copilot Chat would also utilise models from Anthropic and Google, in addition to those from OpenAI.Founded in 2021 by former OpenAI executives, Anthropic was recently valued at $183 billion. Still, Microsoft remains the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI’s programming interface that third-party apps depend on.","Anthropic’s model is set to debut in Researcher, a Microsoft 365 Copilot agent that helps collect information, analyse it, and create reports.
