FIA Set to Revamp Stewarding System for F1 2025



What Do F1 Race Stewards Actually Do?

Formula 1 is set to witness a major change in its stewarding system for the 2025 season, as the FIA has reportedly adjusted the number of stewards assigned to race weekends. According to Autosport, this revision will first be implemented at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, which will feature an expanded panel under the new format.Traditionally, F1 race weekends have been overseen by four stewards, including a former driver and a representative from the national sporting authority. However, the updated regulations for 2025 suggest a shift in this structure. Most grands prix will now see only three stewards officiating, while select high-intensity race weekends will retain four stewards to manage increased workloads. These six high-profile events include the Australian, Chinese, Canadian, Singapore, Mexican, and Brazilian Grands Prix.The FIA Sporting Regulations have been updated accordingly, confirming that “a minimum of three and a maximum of four stewards, one of whom will be appointed chairman” will oversee each grand prix. This move is expected to streamline decision-making across race weekends while maintaining regulatory consistency.The FIA’s approach to stewarding has been a subject of debate, particularly after the removal of Johnny Herbert from the panel. The three-time race winner was dismissed due to concerns over a conflict of interest with his F1 punditry role. Herbert’s outspoken analysis of drivers, especially Max Verstappen, sparked controversy, with both Verstappen and his father, Jos, reacting to his critiques during the 2024 season.Similarly, 1996 World Champion Damon Hill faced backlash for his criticism of Verstappen, with comments that further fueled discussions around impartiality in F1 stewarding. As the 2025 season approaches, it remains to be seen how these changes will impact decision-making and whether they will help mitigate controversies surrounding stewarding decisions.Also Read: Christian Horner backs return of iconic V10 engines, echoing FIA Chief’s support for F1’s classic roar With Melbourne set to be the first race under this revised stewarding structure, all eyes will be on how the system performs in practice and whether it delivers the efficiency and fairness the FIA aims to achieve.","FIA set to revamp Stewarding System for F1 2025 season.

Conclave wins best film at BAFTAs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/conclave-wins-best-picture-at-baftas-as-the-brutalist-takes-directing-and-acting-prizes/articleshow/118310797.cms,"LONDON: Papal thriller “ Conclave ” won four prizes including best picture on Sunday at the 78th British Academy Film Awards , where genre-bending musical “ Emilia Pérez ” proved that it’s still an awards contender despite a multipronged backlash that looked to have dented its chances.“The Brutalist” equaled the awards tally of “Conclave,"" scooping four trophies, including best director for Brady Corbet and best actor for Adrien Brody. Mikey Madison won the best actress prize for Brooklyn tragicomedy “Anora.”“Conclave,” which stars Ralph Fiennes as a cardinal corralling conniving clergy as they elect a new pope, beat “The Brutalist,” “Emilia Pérez,” Bob Dylan biopic “ A Complete Unknown "" to the top prize. ""Conclave” was also named outstanding British film and took trophies for editing and adapted screenplay.Supporting performer prizes went to Kieran Culkin for “A Real Pain” and Zoe Saldaña for “Emilia Pérez,"" which also won the award for best film not in the English language.Saldaña won for her role as a lawyer who helps the title character transition to a woman and out of a life of crime. She called the film “the creative challenge of a lifetime.”Best actress nominee Karla Sofía Gascón, who stars as the titular transgender ex-cartel boss in “Emilia Pérez,” wasn’t at the ceremony. Gascón has withdrawn from promoting the film, which has 13 Oscar nominations, amid controversy over her social media posts disparaging Muslims, George Floyd and diversity at the Oscars.Audiard has condemned those comments, but in his acceptance speech thanked Gascón and her co-stars Saldaña and Selena Gomez.“I am deeply proud of what we have all achieved together,"" he said.From the BAFTAs to the OscarsStars including Cynthia Erivo, Hugh Grant, Ariana Grande, Lupita Nyong’o, Timothée Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan walked the red carpet at London’s Royal Festival Hall for the awards, known as BAFTAs.The prizes will be watched for clues about who will triumph at Hollywood’s Academy Awards on March 2, in an unusually hard-to-call awards season.They also have a distinctly British accent. The ceremony kicked off with its kilt-wearing host, Scottish actor David Tennant, leading the audience in a rousing singalong of The Proclaimers’ anthem “I’m Gonna be (500 Miles).”Culkin's award came for “A Real Pain,” about odd couple cousins on a trip to explore their roots. The film's writer and co-star, Jesse Eisenberg, took the BAFTA for best original screenplay.“I’d like to share this with my wife, who didn’t come because she didn’t think I’d win,” Eisenberg quipped.“Anora,” about an exotic dancer entangled with a Russian oligarch's son, had been a best picture favorite after winning the top prizes last week at the Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards.“The Brutalist” had nine BAFTA nominations, while “Anora,” the sci-fi epic “Dune: Part Two” and musical “Wicked” hade seven each. “A Complete Unknown” and Irish-language hip-hop drama “Kneecap” received six nominations apiece.Brody won over stiff competition from Fiennes and Chalamet, who plays the young Dylan in “A Complete Unknown.” The other male actors nominated were Grant for his creepy role in the horror film “ Heretic,” Colman Domingo in real-life prison drama “ Sing Sing ” and Sebastian Stan for his portrayal of a young Donald Trump in “ The Apprentice.”Stan, who is also Oscar nominated, said it was “incredibly validating” to get recognition for the film, which initially struggled to find an American distributor. It's an origins story that focuses on Trump's relationship with ruthless power broker Roy Cohn, played by Jeremy Strong.“We were told this was going to be a thankless job that was never going to lead to anything,” Stan said, describing the movie as a “fair” depiction of the president.Best-actress nominees were Madison, Gascón, Demi Moore for body-horror film “ The Substance,” Ronan for “The Outrun,” Erivo for “Wicked” and Marianne Jean-Baptiste for the Mike Leigh drama “Hard Truths.” Erivo or Jean-Baptiste would have been the first non-white performer to win the leading actress BAFTA.Animated caper “Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl” won awards for best animated feature and best family and children’s film.Sci-fi epic “Dune: Part Two” won prizes for sound and visual effects. “The Brutalist” won for cinematography and musical score. Musical “Wicked” took the costume and production design trophies.Rising stars and lifetime honorsBritain’s film academy introduced changes to increase the awards’ diversity in 2020, when no women were nominated as best director for the seventh year running and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white.Most winners are chosen by 8,000 members of the U.K. academy of industry professionals, with one — the Rising Star Award —- selected by public vote from a shortlist of nominees. This year's winner was David Jonsson, star of high finance drama series “Industry” and London rom-com “Rye Lane.”“Star, I don’t know,” he said. “But rising, I guess.”“Willow” and “Return of the Jedi” actor Warwick Davis received the academy’s top honor, the BAFTA Fellowship, for his screen career and work to create a more inclusive film industry.He founded a talent agency for actors under 5 feet tall, because, he said, “short actors weren’t known for their talent, just their height.”BAFTA chairwoman Sara Putt sent a message of strength to everyone hit by last month’s devastating Los Angeles wildfires. Jamie Lee Curtis, a supporting actress nominee for “The Last Showgirl,” was absent because the fires delayed filming on her current work.The event was without a dash of royal glamour this year. Neither Prince William, who is honorary president of the British film academy, nor his wife Kate are attending. The awards coincide with school holidays for their three children.William, 42, sent a recorded video message that was played before the presentation of the Rising Star Award.","Papal thriller ""Conclave "" wins four prizes including best picture.

Toddler Calls 911 For Doughnuts

An Oklahoma toddler took emergency services by surprise when he dialed 911—not for help, but for “emergency doughnuts.”The Moore Police Department shared audio of the call on social media, where little Bennett insisted it was a real emergency. Officers later showed up at his home with a box of doughnuts, making the toddler’s day. The New York Post first reported the story.In the 911 call, little Bennett first spoke gibberish before hanging up. When he called again, he got straight to the point, telling the dispatcher he needed doughnuts. “911, it is an emergency,” the child said. “An emergency?” the dispatcher asked. “Emergency doughnuts,” Bennett replied.""Doughnuts? I want doughnuts. Are you going to share your doughnuts?"" the dispatcher asked. ""No, I’m not,"" Bennett replied firmly.Despite the non-urgent request, officers decided to make Bennett’s day. The next day, they showed up at his home with a box of Dunkin’ doughnuts.""You called us about doughnuts,"" an officer said in a video posted on social media. ""We came to give you some doughnuts.""Bennett’s excitement was clear as he shouted “Yes!” and eagerly grabbed a doughnut with his brother.According to police, Bennett made the call using an old cellphone. While such devices can’t browse the internet or send messages, they can still call 911 in emergencies.In another post, the police wrote, “Old cell phones may be unable to use high-speed data networks, take photos or play music, but they can still call 911 in an emergency. As long as an old cell phone is functional, it can be used in an emergency.”","Toddler calls 911 for ""emergency doughnuts"" Moore Police Department shared audio of the call on social media.

"Elon Musk's internet: So based, much wow. So cringe?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musks-internet-so-based-much-wow-so-cringe/articleshow/118668256.cms,"Elon Musk

SAN FRANCISCO: In 2010, a woman in Sakura, Japan, posted photos of her well-manicured Shiba Inu to her digital journal. The dog, Kabosu , shot her owner a wide-eyed glance, a comic image that quickly jumped from Tumblr to Twitter to Facebook and to the rest of the internet.A meme legend was born. Someone on Reddit called the dog ""DOGE,"" a nonsensical nickname that stuck. Another minted a cryptocurrency in DOGE's name.Now, 15 years later, in the fast churn of internet culture, DOGE is considered very old. But try telling that to Elon Musk , who has co-opted ""DOGE"" for the name of his effort to gut the machinery of the federal government -- more formally, the Department of Government Efficiency.It is one of dozens of old-internet ephemera that are baked into his everyday vocabulary. A brief scroll through Musk's X feed reveals a menagerie of aging memes and lingo -- dad jokes for the very online. They include:-- Frequent references to ""420,"" a half-century-old slang term for smoking marijuana said to have started in a high school in Northern California. (After smoking what looked like a blunt live on the Joe Rogan podcast, Musk briefly changed his Twitter bio to ""420."")-- Regularly including the number ""69,"" a slang term for a sex act that has been around since at least the Kama Sutra. (Musk, who is 53 years old, is quick to point out that his birthday falls 69 days after 4/20.)-- Calling things that he supports ""epic"" or ""based."" These are adjectives favored by frequent users of Reddit and popularized by fans of Joss Whedon, a director who created the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer "" television series in the late 1990s and went on to direct two of the Avengers movies. (Musk has said he wants to create ""based"" artificial intelligence with his chatbot, Grok, and recently told Tesla investors he expected an ""epic"" 2026 ahead for the company.)Musk's slang may seem inscrutable to people who aren't steeped in online culture. But to his fans, Musk's dated sensibilities are a kind of internet comfort food -- and a nod to a shared, aggrieved worldview.Musk's posts are full of the language of warfare and conquest portrayed in video games. That loaded language is a rallying cry for gamers and others from Musk's very online world who -- if they have a common political ideology -- see in him someone who shares their skepticism of authority and their belief that America has gone too ""woke."" To them, Musk's online updates about what DOGE is up to come across as far more honest than a press release or news conference or -- worst of all -- something they read in the mainstream media. (It's a strategy that recalls Donald Trump's use of Twitter to signal authenticity during his first administration.)""We're living in the revenge of the nerds era,"" Hasan Piker, a popular, politically progressive online personality who is not a fan of Musk, said in an interview. ""This is the real, actual revenge of the nerds.""Musk did not respond to a request for comment.Every photo of Musk wielding a chain saw while wearing ""deal with it"" sunglasses indoors (another meme) represents a triumph of the nerd culture he has long identified with. On Wednesday, he attended the first meeting of President Donald Trump's new Cabinet wearing a T-shirt that said ""Tech Support.""His fans speak back to him in his language. They send suggestions on how DOGE can fix the government by dismantling entire sections of it, often coded in the language of images typically found on Reddit. (Wojak, a crudely drawn character popularized on message board 4chan, is a perennial favorite.)Musk prods his more than 200 million X followers for help with decisions in online polls. And he listens. The conversation becomes a feedback loop of insider jokes for the billionaire, who once hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" and prides himself on his sense of humor.""Anyone can find their own community, even if it's a community frozen in 2010,"" Brian Feldman, an internet culture writer who has long followed Musk's exploits, said in an interview.But to those steeped in modern internet culture, Musk's communication style is far from on trend. That is especially so when even current terms like ""no cap"" (translation: no lie) or ""lowkey fell off"" (waned in popularity or relevance) are already showing their age. As with recent questions about Musk's claims of superior video game skills, they see cracks in his supernerd facade.""More than people would like to admit, they often become trapped in the internet they first encounter,"" Feldman said.Last week, Musk appeared at a conservative political conference wearing dark sunglasses, a big gold chain and a T-shirt that said he was ""not procrastinating"" but instead working on ""side quests"" (a common practice in sprawling role-playing games). He played off the quote from Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita that Robert Oppenheimer said was going through his mind as he tested the first atomic bomb: ""Now, I am become Death. The destroyer of worlds.""""I am become meme,"" Musk said to a mostly mute crowd. ""There's living the dream, and there's living the meme, and that's pretty much what's happening.""Even some of his most fervent followers on X recoiled. ""Elon Musk fell off lowkey,"" one user wrote.Musk's online vocabulary is a reminder of 2010, when nerd culture was ascendant. Reddit was a meme factory for favorites like Lolcats and icanhazcheeseburger. Gamers gathered in web forums or on online role-playing games to hang out and fight through digital dungeons.This was also the beginning of Musk's metamorphosis from mere billionaire to internet celebrity. That year, he appeared as himself in the second ""Iron Man"" film. His online fans ate it up.All of this also coincided with the rise of Web 2.0, a more social version of the internet. Twitter -- long before Musk bought it and renamed it -- was a town square. Facebook moved beyond likes and status updates with "" Groups ,"" a feature that allowed people to form their own smaller communities. Chat forum 4chan was full of anonymous, often angry online trolls who bonded over vulgar behavior.While online groups had existed for years, the newer social networks were more tightly knit and rewarded the behavior that Musk often displays today. The right kind of posts could pick up steam and shoot across the internet.Provocateurs moved beyond small-scale trolling to aggressive mass movements, such as Gamergate, a targeted harassment campaign against a female game designer by video game players who claimed she represented a lack of ethics in games journalism. It morphed into a social movement that fought diversity, feminism and what gamers saw as overly progressive values in film, television, literature and the video game industry -- a viewpoint that Musk shares.Gamergate also signaled that digital demonstrations could, for better or worse, lead to real-world change.Musk's tweeting style changed from anodyne company updates to more overt trolling. In 2018, he tweeted that he had secured a buyout offer for Tesla for a stock price of $420. Once, when a competing car company tried undercutting him on price, Musk said that he would drop the cost of his Tesla Model X to $69,420.""The gauntlet has been thrown down!"" he proclaimed on Twitter. ""The prophecy has been fulfilled.""Unlike other tech billionaires, who seemed to live lives far removed from regular internet folk and became less online the richer they got, Musk was making himself relatable with memes, absurdity and relentless posting. And parts of the online world embraced him.""Many people find him off-putting, I think,"" coldhealing, a pseudonymous cultural commentator who regularly follows Musk and other social movements online, said in an interview. ""But there are many people who he resonates with, and even though I think it's 10% of the population max, it's an influential 10%.""Musk's online life became even more bombastic after the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. He attacked Tesla short-sellers and California state officials who wouldn't let him reopen a Tesla factory. In 2023, he even live-tweeted photos of himself driving to Mark Zuckerberg's house, threatening to wrestle the CEO of Facebook. (They were, at the time, in the throes of organizing a real fighting match between them. It never happened.)He posted himself playing video games such as Elden Ring, Path of Exile and Diablo IV. One of the world's wealthiest men was telling gamers that he was one of them.Mark Kern, a former video game executive at Blizzard, wrote in a post to X in February that people should not mess with gamers.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This feature, developed by DeepMind as part of Project Astra, allows users to show Gemini a live video feed from their device's camera. The AI can then process the visual information in real-time and answer questions about it.At Google I/O 2024, the company showcased a demo video in which a user shows Gemini different objects and converse with it in natural language. In the latest video, Google shows that a person is pointing the camera at a pottery collection, asking for advice on choosing a colour for their next vase.Gemini analyses the colors of the existing pottery and the available colour options to suggest a complementary choice.The screen-sharing feature allows users to share their screen with Gemini in real-time. Gemini can then answer questions about what it sees on the screen, follow the user's actions as they navigate between pages and apps, and even help users find specific settings or web pages.These new features are expected to be available to paid Gemini subscribers later this month. Eligible users will see a new video icon in the Gemini Live interface to access the Live Video feature .
