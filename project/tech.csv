The world’s largest beaver dam is so big that you can see it from space,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/the-worlds-largest-beaver-dam-is-so-big-that-you-can-see-it-from-space/articleshow/126520430.cms,"AI-generated

A beaver dam hidden in Canada is clearly visible from space

The actual size of the beaver dam is impressive

This beaver dam was discovered from space

Why beavers build on this scale

What the dam means for the wider park





Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada, which includes northern Alberta and parts of the Northwest Territories, is home to the largest beaver dam ever documented. The structure is located deep within the park, far from roads, towns, and established paths, making it inaccessible by foot. It is so large that it can be seen in satellite photographs from orbit. The dam is approximately 775 metres long at its front edge and spans an area of around 70,000 square metres, keeping back a substantial volume of water. It was initially discovered in 2007 using satellite imaging rather than terrestrial exploration. Further investigation revealed that the dam did not exist before 1980, implying that it was developed over several decades by multiple generations of beavers operating in the same spot.Wood Buffalo National Park spans northern Alberta and parts of the Northwest Territories. It is Canada's largest national park and among the world's largest protected places. The beaver dam is located deep within it, far from roads, cities, and recognised trails.Walking to the place would take several days. The terrain is challenging and slow. Wetlands extend over large distances. Muskeg collapses under weight.The boreal forest closes in densely. Most people who saw the dam up close did not walk there. They arrived on private sightseeing planes, looking down rather than approaching on the ground.According to Parks Canada , from end to end, the front of the dam measures roughly 775 metres. That is close to seven football fields laid side by side. The entire perimeter of the dam area approaches 2,000 metres. Its surface area covers about 70,000 square metres.The pond created behind the dam is thought to be around one metre deep. That would place the volume of water at roughly 70,000 cubic metres. Another way to see it is through scale. A standard dump truck carries about 10 cubic yards. By that measure, the dam holds back the equivalent of more than 90,000 dump trucks of water. Seen as ice, it would fill around 1,600 hockey rinks.According to BBC Wildlife , no explorer stumbled across this dam by chance. No ranger logged it during patrol. It was first noticed in 2007, not on the ground, but in satellite imagery. The structure was large enough to be visible from space.Further images, including those provided by NASA, showed that the dam did not exist before 1980. That suggests it could be up to 45 years old. Over that time, it grew slowly, piece by piece, shaped by water flow and repeated work rather than a single effort. The location helped keep it hidden. With no nearby access routes, there was little reason for people to pass through.Beavers are often described as ecosystem engineers. They change landscapes by design, even if that design follows instinct rather than a plan. By felling trees and packing wood, mud, stones, and vegetation together, they redirect water and create ponds.In the case of this dam, multiple generations of beavers worked on the same structure. Each added material where it was needed. Over time, the dam expanded and strengthened, holding back runoff from the Birch Mountains at the southern edge of the park. The result is not just a barrier but an entire water system shaped by animals rather than machines.Wood Buffalo National Park is known for more than its size. It supports wood bison, whooping cranes, and the Peace Athabasca Delta, one of the largest inland freshwater deltas in the world. The beaver dam fits quietly into that setting.It supports wetlands, slows water movement, and creates habitat for other species. It does not draw crowds or require fences. It simply exists, doing its work out of sight. Even now, most people will never see it directly. The dam remains where it was built, surrounded by forest and water, changing its corner of the park a little at a time.","The beaver dam is located in Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada.

“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work”

Who was Thomas Alva Edison



What this Thomas Edison quote means



“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.”

Why this quote still matters



How people relate to it today







People remember Thomas A. Edison as one of the most important inventors. He worked on a lot of ideas and had thousands of patents over the course of his life. Many of his inventions are now a part of daily life, like the electric light bulb and sound recording devices. But Edison was known for more than just what he made. People also knew how he thought about work, hard work, and success., is one of the most popular things he has said. Edison talks about a simple habit that a lot of people have. People often look for opportunities in things that seem fun, easy, or rewarding right away. It's easier to ignore something when it looks hard or requires a lot of work. Edison thought this was where a lot of people went wrong. He says that opportunities don't usually come in a polished or attractive way. Instead, it often comes in a quiet way that looks like work that needs to be done.Thomas Alva Edison was born in 1847 in the US. He was curious about how things worked from a young age. As he got older, this curiosity turned into a habit of trying new things and making old ones better. Edison worked on many projects at once and thought that progress came from working hard over and over again instead of getting quick results.Some of the most important things he invented were the electric light bulb, phonograph, and the motion picture camera. He also built labs where groups of people could work together on long-term experiments. Edison thought that being patient, testing things out, and working hard every day were all important parts of coming up with new ideas. A lot of historical records say that he saw innovation as a normal part of his job, not a flash of genius.Edison said,He was using a simple picture to explain a common reaction. Overalls are clothes that people wear to do physical or practical work. Edison used this picture to show that opportunities often seem normal and hard to get.A lot of people think that success will come quickly or with little work. They might want results right away, without having to learn, practice, or fail along the way. Edison said that real opportunities usually require work first and pay off later. Because of this, people sometimes miss out on chances that could have helped them grow.This idea is still important because it shows how people make choices every day. Students might not want to study subjects that need more practice. Workers might not want to do tasks that seem hard. People may put off their personal goals if they seem hard or uncertain. Edison's words remind readers that trying hard doesn't mean you've failed; it usually means that something important is possible.The quote tells people to think about work in a new way. Instead of viewing work as a hindrance, it proposes perceiving it as an integral component of the opportunity.This quote is often used in classrooms, offices, and talks about how to grow as a person. Teachers use it to show how important it is to be consistent. Employers share it to show that hard work pays off in the long run. People think about it when they are deciding whether or not to take on tasks that need a lot of patience.Edison's words still ring true because they describe a reality that many people know. At first, opportunities may not seem appealing, but those who are willing to put in the work often reap the benefits in the end.","Thomas Alva Edison was one of the most important inventors of the 20th century.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to engineers: I want you to stop coding and start...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-to-engineers-i-want-you-to-stop-coding-and-start-/articleshow/126543905.cms,"Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang aims for engineers to code zero percent, leveraging AI assistants like Cursor to tackle complex, undiscovered problems. He believes this 'Purpose vs Task' approach, akin to radiology's evolution, will elevate human roles. While some, like Cursor's CEO, caution against unchecked AI development, Huang remains confident in this human-centric future for innovation.

Why radiologists didn't disappear, and why engineers might not either

Vibe coding pioneers warn Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ’s approach has limits





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wants his engineers to spend exactly zero percent of their time writing code. In a recent appearance on the No Priors AI podcast, Huang revealed that every engineer at the $3 trillion chipmaker now uses Cursor, an AI coding assistant, throughout their workday. His goal? Free them entirely from what he calls 'syntax' so they can focus on finding and solving problems that haven't been cracked yet.""Nothing would give me more joy than if none of our engineers were coding at all,"" Huang said. ""And they were just purely solving undiscovered problems.""This isn't just philosophical musing. Huang has been pushing a framework he calls 'Purpose vs Task' across multiple interviews in recent months, including a viral appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience. The idea is simple: coding is the task, but discovering and solving novel problems is the purpose. AI should handle the former so humans can concentrate on the latter.Huang points to radiology as proof this approach creates jobs rather than eliminates them. Years ago, AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton predicted radiologists would be obsolete within five years because computers could scan images faster than humans. Instead, radiologist numbers have grown.The reason, Huang argues, is that reading scans was always just a task—the real purpose is diagnosing disease and improving patient outcomes. When AI took over the grunt work, demand for the human expertise behind it actually expanded.At Nvidia's recent all-hands meeting, Huang reportedly pushed back hard against managers who were telling teams to dial back AI usage. ""Are you insane?"" he said, according to Business Insider. He promised employees they'd still have work to do—just more ambitious work, the report said.The push comes at a pivotal moment for software engineering. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently revealed that AI now writes over 30% of new code at the company, while Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei claimed Claude generates 90% of his firm's code. Yet a METR study from July found AI assistants actually decreased experienced developers' productivity by 19%—even though participants expected a 20% boost. The gap between hype and reality suggests Huang's vision of code-free engineers may be further out than his enthusiasm implies.Not everyone shares Huang's unbridled optimism. Michael Truell, CEO of Cursor itself—the $29 billion startup whose AI tool Nvidia has embraced—recently cautioned against 'vibe coding,' where developers let AI build software without reviewing the output. ""If you close your eyes and don't look at the code and have AIs build things with shaky foundations, things start to kind of crumble,"" Truell told Fortune's Brainstorm AI conference.Even Andrej Karpathy, the former Tesla AI director who coined the term 'vibe coding,' admitted his recent Nanochat project was ""basically entirely hand-written"" because AI agents ""just didn't work well enough."" He recently warned fellow programmers: ""I've never felt this much behind. The profession is being dramatically refactored.""For now, the Nvidia CEO is betting big that humans who focus on purpose rather than tasks will come out ahead. Whether that bet pays off for the millions of developers who actually write code for a living remains the undiscovered problem.","Jensen Huang, CEO of $3 trillion chipmaker Nvidia, wants engineers to spend zero percent of their time writing code.

Artificial intelligence is no longer something people only argue about in tech conferences or future forecasts. It is already quietly shaping daily life in profound and often unexpected ways. From customer support chats to recommendation engines, from coding tools to medical research, AI is now part of how work gets done efficiently. And according to Bill Gates , the pace of change is about to speed up even more dramatically.In his latest annual letter, The Year Ahead, the Microsoft co-founder lays out a clear message. AI will reshape society, economies, and jobs faster than most people expect. Gates says he remains optimistic about technology, but this time his optimism comes with serious warnings. The benefits are real. So are the risks. And ignoring either would be a grave mistake.Gates has spent decades watching technology alter economies and daily life. In his letter, he says AI is different from past waves of innovation. Not just faster, but broader. He argues that artificial intelligence could affect more parts of society than any previous human-made tool.He points to progress already happening. AI is accelerating disease research, improving climate modelling, and expanding access to digital education.Tasks that once took years can now be completed in months, sometimes weeks. For Gates, this is proof that AI can solve hard problems if used well.But he also stresses that hope alone is not a strategy. Institutions, governments, and workers are not fully prepared for how quickly these changes are arriving. Without planning, the speed of AI adoption could leave many people behind.One of Gates’ biggest concerns is how AI could be misused. As advanced tools become more accessible, the barrier to harmful use drops. He has warned that open-source AI systems could be exploited by bad actors, including non-state groups.In particular, Gates has raised alarms about biological threats. He suggests that AI-assisted misuse could pose risks even greater than naturally occurring pandemics. That is not a casual statement. It reflects a growing fear among researchers that powerful tools, in the wrong hands, could scale harm faster than ever before.Gates argues that global cooperation is essential. Clear rules, oversight, and governance structures are needed. At the same time, he acknowledges the tension. Too many restrictions could slow beneficial innovation. Too little could invite danger. Finding the balance will not be easy.Jobs sit at the centre of Gates’ warning. He says AI makes it possible to produce more goods and services with less human labour. That reality will change how companies hire and how work is valued.Some of this is already visible. In software development, AI tools help programmers write, test, and maintain code faster. Gates notes that developers can now be significantly more productive, which lowers costs and reshapes team structures.He also points to sectors like warehouse operations and phone-based customer service. As AI systems improve, these roles are likely to face pressure. Automation will not arrive all at once, but it will arrive steadily.Gates does not frame this as doom. He frames it as a disruption that needs preparation.Beyond job losses, Bill Gates talks about how work itself might change. If AI boosts productivity enough, shorter workweeks could become possible. The same output, fewer hours. It sounds appealing. But he is careful not to present it as automatic.Whether these gains benefit most people depends on policy choices. Who owns the productivity gains. How companies share them. Without thoughtful decisions, Gates warns that efficiency could concentrate wealth instead of spreading it.This is where governments and institutions matter. AI alone will not deliver fairness. People have to decide what to do with the gains it creates.","Bill Gates says AI will reshape society, economies, and jobs faster than most people expect.

Grok AI restricts image editing features to paid X users

Elon Musk warns, ‘Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will …’





Grok the AI chatbot of Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence firm xAI will no longer be able to generate sexualised or revealing images of real people. The company took this decision after the mounting criticism and regulatory scrutiny. In a post blog post share on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the company company confirmed that it has implemented technological measures in to order to prevent Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people. This move of the company comes after Grok users were exploiting the tool to create AI deepfakes of women and minors, undressing them in manipulated images.California Attorney General Rob Bonta revealed he had launched an investigation into Grok’s role in producing sexualized deepfakes, citing a flood of complaints in recent weeks. Meanwhile, Indonesia and Malaysia suspended Grok entirely, becoming the first countries to ban the tool. Lawmakers in the UK have also publicly considered a suspension.In a statement posted on X’s safety account the company wrote:Recently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok, integrated into his social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), has now announced that its image generation and editing tools will now be restricted to paying subscribers. Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers. You can subscribe to unlock these features,” Grok posted late January 8, linking to X’s premium membership page.Elon Musk said that anyone using AI chatbot Grok to make illegal content on his platform X (formerly known as Twitter) will be punished. Musk’s comments came after the chatbot – hardwired into X came under fire for producing obscene/ non-consensual images, including women and children. In an online post, the tech billionaire wrote “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content”. The Tesla CEO was responding to a post on “inappropriate images” generated by grok.DogeDesigner, followed by Elon Musk wrote in the post: “Some people are saying Grok is creating inappropriate images. But that’s like blaming a pen for writing something bad. A pen doesn’t decide what gets written. The person holding it does. Grok works the same way. What you get depends a lot on what you put in. Think about it!”.",Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok will no longer be able to generate sexualised or revealing images of real people.

Wang finds Zuckerberg's micromanagement suffocating, while staff question his leadership of Meta's AI ambitions. A recent restructuring centralizes infrastructure decisions above Wang, indicating Zuckerberg's desire for tighter control over the company's significant AI investments.

Wang's inexperience becomes liability for Mark Zuckerberg as AI race intensifies

Meta reorganizes infrastructure chain of command above Wang





Meta's newest reporting structure is exposing something leadership has tried to hide—friction between CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his highest-paid employee, Alexandr Wang. Multiple sources close to the company reveal that Wang, the 28-year-old founder Zuckerberg recruited for $14 billion, finds the CEO's hands-on management suffocating. At the same time, current staff question whether Wang has the chops to lead Meta's $600 billion AI bet.The tension surfaced this fall during a crucial meeting. Wang's TBD Lab team and longtime executives Chris Cox and Andrew Bosworth clashed over strategy. Cox and Bosworth wanted Wang's new AI model trained on Instagram and Facebook data to boost the company's core advertising business. Wang pushed back hard. He argued the goal should be catching up to OpenAI and Google's models first, worrying that customizing training for product tasks would slow progress.It's an us-versus-them mentality that's become impossible to ignore inside Meta. Wang's researchers view the old guard as mere product managers stuck in the social media era. They're chasing superintelligence while everyone else cares about feeds and ads. Some staff even questioned whether $2 billion was quietly shifted from Bosworth's Reality Labs budget to Wang's team—though Meta's spokesperson denied the figure, the whispers persist.The cracks widened when Yann LeCun, Meta's legendary AI scientist and a Turing Award winner, bolted in November rather than report to Wang. Sources say LeCun bristled at serving under someone whose background was data labeling, not cutting-edge AI research. Before that, Nat Friedman, another big hire, faced pressure to move faster. The rushed launch of Vibes, Meta's AI video feed, frustrated his team who felt forced to compete with OpenAI's Sora before they were ready.Wang told associates that Zuckerberg's micromanagement feels suffocating. Yet here's the irony—Zuckerberg hired him specifically because he needed someone he could control, someone young and ambitious enough to execute his vision of ""personal superintelligence."" The CEO's reputation for obsessing over chosen projects means TBD Lab gets his undivided attention. That laser focus looks less like support and more like surveillance, the report said.This week, Zuckerberg announced Meta Compute, a new top-level initiative reporting directly to him. He's putting Santosh Janardhan and Daniel Gross in charge, with Dina Powell McCormick handling government relations. The move effectively centralizes infrastructure decisions above Wang, suggesting Zuckerberg wants tighter control as Meta burns through billions. If Wang thought he had autonomy, this announcement proved otherwise. The company's trajectory suggests Zuckerberg's betting everything on AI—and he's not delegating that to a 28-year-old anymore.The restructuring carries real risks. Wang's TBD Lab only lost two researchers during their first vesting period in November, suggesting the team still has some loyalty. But the organizational shuffle sends a message that nobody—not even the $14 billion hire—operates without Zuckerberg's constant oversight. Scale AI, the startup Zuckerberg invested in to poach Wang, is already losing credibility in the market. Private investors have slashed its valuation from $29 billion to as low as $7.3 billion. If Wang's leadership at Meta falters, it raises uncomfortable questions: did Zuckerberg overpay for the wrong person, or is he simply incapable of trusting anyone with real power?","Alexandr Wang, Meta's highest-paid employee, finds Mark Zuckerberg's hands-on management suffocating.

Why hundreds of bald eagles are flocking to northern British Columbia’s frozen mountains during winter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/why-hundreds-of-bald-eagles-are-flocking-to-northern-british-columbias-frozen-mountains-during-winter/articleshow/126672217.cms,"Source: X

Why British Columbia’s winter landscapes draw bald eagles together



Bald eagles and rare winter group behaviour



What winter eagle gatherings reveal to scientists







In the frozen mountains of northern British Columbia, there was the unusual occurrence of a rare incident in the wildlife scene where the bald eagles were gathered in their hundreds in one spot, and in the middle of winter. Against the background of mountains laden with snow and the icy river valley, the sight was quite outstanding and unusual. For bald eagles, which stand out in their status as symbols of freedom, power, and dominance in nature, it was highly unusual for them to congregate in such huge numbers because they were predominantly lone animals and territorial in their behaviour patterns. The severity of the weather seemed to have had a huge effect on the eagles, as only limited spaces were available and where their feeds were still accessible, forcing unprecedented gatherings that stunned researchers and local communities alike.The northern area of British Columbia is important to the wintering survival of bald eagles. Though much of this area will freeze, there will always be fast-moving rivers that are partially open, providing the eagles with readily available fish. Rivers that support salmon are usually connected, forming pathways to life-sustaining riverways. As winter approaches and the temperature cools, bald eagles from an increasingly vast area will migrate to these feeding grounds, and many will be seen in one small area.The harsh environment imposed by winter causes a shift in bald eagles' normal habits. The immobility brought by snow, the uninhabitability of lakes due to ice, and the shorter daylight hours make energy conservation essential. The habit of securing territories disappears, with eagles seeking locations close to food sources. The movement of prey through the snow-covered environment is predictable, helping the eagles modify their hunting patterns. What seems like a rare concentration of birds is, in actual fact, a decision based on survival that is influenced by the environment.In areas outside breeding colonies or feeding grounds, however, bald eagles tend to be alone. Adults do not compete with each other, particularly around feeding areas. To witness so many of them assemble at one place is a clear indication that their social norms have been temporarily overlooked. Experts say that it is possible only in areas where food is plentiful and accessible. In such areas, even though competition may be a disadvantage, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to observe their flexibility in handling their socialisation.The group behaviours exhibited during winter are very advantageous in several ways. The eagles can view each other in search of food, thus saving time looking for it in the frozen land. Additionally, the dominant eagles will either jump over the ice or find a source of food first as an indirect means of providing for the rest of the group members. The younger and weaker eagles are able to get protection by staying in a group, thus minimising the chances of starvation.Large winter gatherings offer a unique opportunity to study bald eagles under environmental stress. Scientists are able to estimate population size, age structure, feeding patterns, and social tolerance. It helps them to get an idea about the resiliency of the species towards extreme weather and habitat pressure. This kind of data is very crucial in view of changing climatic cycles that disturb food availability and migration behaviour in an ecosystem.The sight of hundreds of eagles in one place often plays the role of a sign of ecological vigour: healthy fish populations, undisrupted waterways, and preserved forest habitats. These aggregations are the natural barometers by which environmental health is spotlighted, emphasising those areas where ecosystems are healthy and working.","The sight of hundreds of bald eagles in one place in British Columbia stunned researchers and local communities alike.

Check around you before stepping out: Look under seats and door pockets.

Keep essential items in an outward pocket or visible area.

Note the taxi plate number or booking details until you’ve fully disembarked.

Dubai’s Lost & Found: A model for smart cities







Dubai’s famous taxis are not just fast and reliable, they are also a magnet for forgotten belongings. According to the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), passengers left behind a staggering 104,162 items in taxis across the Emirate during 2025, prompting one of the city’s busiest Lost & Found seasons on record as drivers and the RTA worked to reunite commuters with their lost property.From wallets stuffed with cash to passports and gadgets, the range of forgotten items reflects the hustle of everyday life in Dubai and the efficiency of a system designed to ensure that lost does not have to mean gone forever. Here’s a closer look at what riders forgot most and how Dubai’s smart mobility network brought them back.The lost and found numbers from RTA reveal that Dubai riders were not just leaving behind the occasional umbrella or pair of sunglasses, they were dropping valuable and essential items after rides. Over AED 2 million in cash was handed into the Lost & Found team in 2025, alongside a flood of high-tech devices and personal documents.Here’s a snapshot of what riders left behind:These figures highlight just how often commuters hustle out of taxis without double-checking pockets, bags or seat areas, perhaps rushed by work, social plans or caregiving duties. The sheer volume also underscores the importance of Dubai’s lost-item recovery infrastructure.The Dubai RTA did not just log these reports; it made getting items back surprisingly smooth for riders. RTA’s system is built around swift communication, detailed tracking and cooperation between call center teams, drivers and taxi companies, often resulting in a recovery within two hours of the initial report.Meera Al Shaikh, Director of Customer Happiness at the RTA, explained that the lost property framework strengthens trust in Dubai’s mobility ecosystem, raising satisfaction not just for journeys but for what passengers take with them afterward.The reporting process itself is multilingual and highly accessible. Passengers can report lost items through:Services are offered in Arabic, English, Hindi, Filipino, French, Chinese, Russian and more, reflecting Dubai’s highly diverse population and making it easy for tourists, residents and workers alike to submit a lost item claim with minimal friction.Being distracted, juggling bags or stepping out in a hurry are everyday occurrences but in a city like Dubai, where taxi trips can be short and frequent, these moments add up to a significant number of forgotten belongings. Unlike many other global cities where lost items may never be reunited with their owners, Dubai’s approach has become a benchmark for urban mobility services.However, it is not just about numbers. The system empowers riders to reclaim valuables quickly and securely. Identity verification protects passengers’ privacy and integrated tracking technologies ensure swift communication with drivers once an item is reported.The RTA’s Lost & Found team reported over 30 messages of gratitude from riders in 2025 alone, a small but telling indicator of how these efforts improve everyday life for commuters across the city.Even with an efficient recovery system in place, prevention is always better than reclamation. Common taxi riders in Dubai and beyond often leave behind items like smartphones, wallets and keys simply because they’re thinking about their next stop. Research from ride-hailing lost property indexes elsewhere suggests items like glasses, bags and even wedding rings sometimes get left behind when commuters rush between meetings or errands.Here are practical tips to reduce that “oops” moment:What if something does get left behind? Filing a report via the RTA call centre or app quickly is the best way to get that item back while the taxi is still nearby.Dubai’s experience with lost items in taxis is not just about forgetfulness, it is a testament to how smart city infrastructure, responsive government services and community cooperation can turn everyday problems into positive outcomes. Where some cities struggle to reunite lost property with owners, Dubai’s integrated approach, supported by multicultural service channels and tech-enabled systems, sets a high bar.Indeed, the success of the lost property framework complements other facets of Dubai’s transportation vision, which includes expanding digital taxi fleets and enhancing connectivity for residents and visitors alike. Whether it is reconnecting a commuter with their passport or returning a laptop they thought was long gone, Dubai’s taxi Lost & Found system is proving that a seamless urban experience includes confidence that what you leave behind can often be found again, fast, safe and with a smile.","Dubai riders left behind 104,162 items in taxis during 2025, prompting one of the city’s busiest Lost & Found seasons on record.

"No wires, no plugs, just power through the air: How Finland is experimenting with wireless electricity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/no-wires-no-plugs-just-power-through-the-air-how-finland-is-experimenting-with-wireless-electricity/articleshow/126784345.cms,"How electromagnetic fields enable wireless power transfer



How Finnish research moved wireless power beyond the laboratory



Why wireless electricity cannot yet replace traditional power grids







Finland is slowly making a name for itself as an innovator, albeit a low-key one, regarding wireless electricity transmission, which aims to transmit power via the airwaves without having to use cables, sockets, or connectors. Although the concept remains more than a little exotic-sounding, scientists from Finland are slowly but surely pushing the boundaries of said technology via experimental research. Although it promises nothing out of the ordinary and nothing that would result in an electrical paradigm shift regarding the transmission of electricity, it does offer insights into how this realm of technology would develop for various applications in the forthcoming years.Wireless charging involves the use of electromagnetic fields. The idea is quite straightforward. It involves the transmission of electrical charges using electromagnetic fields. This is similar to wireless communication. The only difference is that the wireless communication involves the use of Wi-Fi. The Finnish engineers were interested in using resonant coupling. The other idea they were interested in is magnetic induction.The idea involves the use of electromagnetic waves. The waves can only work if the systems are set on the same frequency.Much of this has been developed from existing knowledge in the area of inductive power transfer and magnetic resonance. Research has been ongoing from Finnish universities in developing these concepts, specifically in the area of how losses in energy transfer can be reduced. Research that has been conducted in universities such as Aalto and Helsinki has enabled the development of the theoretical foundations and practical methodologies for increased efficiency and stability of wireless power transmission.According to the University of Helsinki research, magnetic loop antennas could transmit power wirelessly with relatively high efficiency across limited distances. These findings offered valuable insight into how transmitter and receiver designs influence performance, and how coupling strength can be optimised. Such work has informed later experiments, allowing researchers to move beyond basic proofs of concept.More recent demonstrations by Finnish research teams, reported in international technology coverage, have shown small electronic devices being powered through the air. Although modest in scale, these experiments suggest the technology is no longer confined to isolated laboratory conditions. Public demonstrations and shared test results indicate a gradual shift towards more realistic scenarios, even if commercial use remains some way off.Despite the progress, experts are clear that wireless power transfer currently works best over short ranges and at relatively low power levels. It is most suitable for charging small electronics, sensors, or robotic systems in controlled environments. Performance drops sharply as distance increases, and systems often require specialised receivers and finely tuned electromagnetic fields to function reliably.Finnish scientists are also researching how wireless power would work when exposed to real-world settings. The research has already focused on how human tissue responds to the fields when charging wirelessly, which is important for future applications in medical products such as implants and other devices that might be charged without surgery.Although the research carried out by Finland is definitely indicative of scientific progress, it is anything but indicative of the upcoming substitution of the classical grids. The transportation of high-power energy through wireless technology is set to continue to require the use of infrastructure, at least within the foreseeable future.Industry experts also report that consumer acceptance of wireless power on a mass scale for homes, cars, and even cities will take many years of further research and development. For the time being, however, the Finnish development of wireless power indicates that the interest from around the world is not just for wireless electricity but also something that will supplement traditional power sources. The best use of wireless power actually lies in specialized areas where cables are not feasible.","Finnish scientists are pushing the boundaries of wireless power.

Govt Sends Notice To Elon Musk's X On Grok AI Chatbot Misuse, IT Ministry Seeks Action Report

Pokimane connects Grok AI backlash to her past experience with deepfakes

“I am so sick… seeing this trend where other ppl have been removing… unfortunately 3 yrs ago I had the absolute displeasure where… a male streamer was caught publicly having paid for inappropriate AI content of me/others.”





Pokimane, a popular streamer on the Twitch platform, has talked about the rise of the backlash against Grok-AI, with the streamer going on to say that the recent events about Grok-AI have brought back painful memories of her past. This comes amidst the criticism levied against Grok, which is an AI-powered chatbot developed by xAI, as it allows people to use the platform and manipulate images of women in bad ways.The situation involving Pokimane escalated quickly on social media not only due to her popularity but also because of her personal experience with AI misuse. Pokimane related this situation to an incident of deepfake about her from several years ago, giving this issue of AI safety and responsibility a personal touch.While discussing the issue on stream, Pokimane made it clear that she is exhausted by the repeated misuse of AI technology. She said,Her words reflected both anger and fatigue as similar controversies continue to surface.The Grok AI scandal involves functions that allowed users to mention the AI assistant on X and ask for image modifications, some of which were sexualized images of females inappropriately. The image-editing features were used not only for celebrities but also for ordinary citizens, as well as children, before stricter regulations were imposed by countries such as the UK, the EU, and Southeast Asia. This led xAI to restrict some image-editing functions for Grok for paid users only.Pokimane related this incident to her own experience in 2023, in which streamer Atrioc was called out for tasking deepfake content featuring her and other female streamers. This led to serious discussions on consent and responsible behavior in streaming platforms. Through this example, Pokimane emphasized how much has not changed in this community.She targeted neither Grok specifically nor the community that uses Grok but the culture that allows the existence of tools like that without proper protection. This has been echoed by some members, who claim that, in the development of AI, consent and protection should come before novelty.The importance of Pokimane’s words to the Grok AI controversy cannot be overstated. With her linkages to her own trauma experience, she was able to remind her fans that each time an abusive AI situation is reported, there are indeed victims involved. Thus, her words have served to remind AI developers of the need for boundaries in AI-generated content.","Pokimane, a popular streamer on the Twitch platform, has talked about the rise of the backlash against Grok-AI.

Dubai issues warning over illegal parking deals in Discovery Gardens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-issues-warning-over-illegal-parking-deals-in-discovery-gardens/articleshow/126706296.cms,"Discovery Gardens introduces paid parking in Dubai, warns residents against unofficial rentals / Image: file

Official warning

Permit rules and fees

Delays and app challenges





Dubai’s Discovery Gardens community has introduced a regulated paid parking system aimed at managing the growing number of vehicles and reducing congestion. This change, effective from January 15, 2026, makes on-street parking a paid service, with licence zone signs now in place across the neighbourhood. Residents must apply for parking permits through the official Parkonic system rather than relying on informal arrangements.Each residential unit in buildings without dedicated parking receives one free permit for a vehicle. Additional cars require a paid subscription, typically Dh945 per month or Dh2,625 quarterly, as part of the effort to ensure fair usage and open up street spaces for legitimate residents.In response to posts on community social media pages offering private parking spaces for rent, Parkonic has cautioned residents against unofficial deals. These offers, circulating on platforms like Facebook, involve tenants advertising outdoor parking spaces in exchange for monthly fees.Parkonic emphasised that all valid parking permits can only be obtained through its official app or authorised channels.Payments and registrations made outside the recognised platforms are not supported, and vehicles using such informal arrangements may face regular visitor parking charges or be considered unauthorised, potentially leading to fines or penalties.This advisory aims to protect residents from possible scams and confusion, and to ensure all parking entitlements remain traceable and enforceable under Dubai community rules.The new parking rules have sparked mixed reactions among tenants across the community. Some argue that the fees for second vehicles are too high, especially for families with more than one car, calling for reductions to Dh500-Dh600 or other concessions to ease the burden.There have also been specific concerns from residents of the Zen Cluster (Pink Buildings), a part of Discovery Gardens where only certain apartments have basement parking. A recent circular clarified that on-street parking is excluded from complimentary permit eligibility if a residential unit already has basement parking access, meaning many studio tenants now face visitor tariffs instead of free permits.Residents in this cluster say the lack of free street permits unfairly penalises them and are pushing for equal treatment with tenants in other parts of the community.The transition hasn’t been without hiccups. Parkonic extended the registration deadline to January 19 after numerous residents reported difficulties using the Parkonic app, such as system errors and inability to activate permits even after receiving PINs.To address these issues, Parkonic pledged that residents will not face fines while technical problems persist and that support teams are working to resolve account and activation challenges. This temporary extension has helped more tenants complete the permit process without penalty.Overall, the introduction of paid and regulated parking in Discovery Gardens represents a broader trend in Dubai to standardise parking across communities and reduce misuse by non-residents or long-term street storage. The system aims to free up spaces, reduce traffic problems and prioritise residents, but it also highlights the need for clear communication and flexibility as lived realities catch up with policy.As implementation continues, resident feedback will likely shape future adjustments, especially around fee levels, eligibility criteria, and enforcement practices.",Dubai’s Discovery Gardens community has introduced a regulated paid parking system aimed at managing the growing number of vehicles.

Abu Dhabi rolls out blood test capable of detecting 50+ cancer types,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/abu-dhabi-rolls-out-blood-test-capable-of-detecting-50-cancer-types/articleshow/126670898.cms,"Abu Dhabi’s new blood test makes cancer screening as simple as a lab draw / AI Illustration

How do blood tests detect cancer?

The rollout

Age and Risk: The test is primarily aimed at residents aged 40 and above. It is particularly recommended for those with a family history of cancer or those who have missed traditional screenings.



Location: You can access the test at major healthcare hubs, including facilities operated by Ambulatory Healthcare Services (AHS) and the M42 healthcare network. This covers clinics across Abu Dhabi city, Al Ain, and the Al Dhafra region.



Complimentary Use: It is important to note that this test is meant to complement traditional screenings (like papsmears or mammograms), providing an extra layer of security for cancers that don't have standard screening methods.

Cost

Why does this matter?





Abu Dhabi is once again setting a global benchmark in healthcare. The Department of Health (DoH) and the Abu Dhabi Public Health Centre (ADPHC) have officially introduced a revolutionary Multi-Cancer Early Detection (MCED) blood test.This isn't just another medical check-up; it is a sophisticated ""liquid biopsy"" that can spot the early biological fingerprints of over 50 different types of cancer from a single tube of blood.For years, the medical world has struggled to screen for ""silent killers"", cancers like those in the pancreas, liver, and brain, which often show no symptoms until it is too late.By identifying fragments of cancer DNA circulating in the bloodstream, this test provides a window into the body's health that traditional scans might miss, catching tumors when they are most treatable.The newly introduced test works by identifying cancer-related biological markers circulating in the blood. Unlike traditional screenings, which usually target one cancer at a time, this test can detect dozens of cancers in a single sample, including types that currently have no standard screening methods, such as pancreatic, gastric and certain brain cancers.From a healthcare-system perspective, this is a major accomplishment.It reduces the need for multiple invasive procedures, lowers patient hesitation around screening, and makes early detection far more accessible. The test requires no fasting, no preparation and no hospital admission, making it suitable for integration into routine health check-ups.Doctors involved in the programme have emphasised that this approach removes many of the psychological and practical barriers that prevent people from getting screened in the first place, a key reason cancers are often detected too late.The Department of Health is rolling out this technology with a specific focus on those who need it most. The service is being integrated into the existing IFHAS program, which is Abu Dhabi's comprehensive health screening initiative for residents.The test is currently priced between AED 7,000 and AED 8,000, reflecting the advanced technology behind it. While not positioned as a mass free screening yet, health experts note that detecting multiple cancers through a single test can be more cost-effective over time than multiple separate investigations and late-stage treatments.More importantly, the rollout sends a strong signal about the future direction of healthcare in the UAE, one that prioritises early intervention, data-driven diagnostics and patient-friendly solutions. As similar technologies continue to evolve globally, Abu Dhabi’s early adoption places it among regions leading the transition toward next-generation preventive medicine.This initiative is not just about a new test, it represents an institutional achievement. Abu Dhabi has demonstrated how advanced science, policy support and healthcare infrastructure can come together to address one of the world’s deadliest diseases more effectively.By making early cancer detection simpler and more accessible, the emirate has taken a decisive step toward saving lives before they reach hospital wards, a true measure of progress in modern healthcare.","Abu Dhabi has introduced a revolutionary blood test for cancer screening.

"Dubai new school transport policy: Eligible schools, pooled SUVs and what parents will pay?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-new-school-transport-policy-eligible-schools-pooled-suvs-and-what-parents-will-pay/articleshow/126670105.cms,"Dubai’s RTA pilots a luxury shared transport service for students, offering 15% cheaper fees / AI Generated Image

How does it work?

Shared Rides with Tech-Enabled SUVs: Instead of every family driving separately, students are grouped by neighbourhood and ride in shared, tech-equipped SUVs or buses to and from school.



Smart Routes, Same Targets: Routes are planned using demand data, grouping students headed in similar directions and aligned with school start and finish times.



Optimised Timing: RTA aims to keep ride times under 60 minutes for most trips, which is more predictable than traditional buses or variable car drop-offs.



Managed by Partners: The pilot is being run with Yango Group providing tech and booking systems, and Urban Express Transport operating the vehicles.

The traditional big yellow bus is getting a high-tech makeover. Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has officially rolled out a pilot program that lets students trade the standard bus seat for a luxury SUV. Launched in mid-January 2026, this ""pooled transport"" initiative is designed for students aged 14 and above who attend schools in high-traffic clusters.Instead of a fixed, long-winded bus route that stops at every corner, these high-end vehicles use smart data from Yango Group and Urban Express to pick up students living in the same neighborhood. By grouping children heading to nearby schools into one premium vehicle, the RTA hopes to slash the number of private cars clogging up school gates every morning.Dubai’s pooled system is a shared ride model designed to be efficient, safe and modern:Unlike traditional dedicated school buses that serve only one school, this model is zoned and demand-responsive, similar to ride-hailing, but tailored for students and safety.The initial phase of this ""neighborhood pooling"" is focused on the Al Barsha area, one of Dubai's busiest education hubs. If your child attends one of the following six schools, you are eligible to register for the service:The service isn't just about the ride; it's about the timing.The RTA guarantees that no student will spend more than 60 minutes in the vehicle, and routes are optimized daily to ensure the fastest possible trip from doorstep to classroom. Price of premiumWhile ""luxury SUV"" sounds expensive, the pooling model actually makes it surprisingly affordable. The pilot has launched with a special introductory rate of AED 1,000 per month.Compared to the cost of fuel, the time spent by a parent or driver in traffic, and traditional bus fees, the RTA estimates this model can save families about 15% in costs. Parents get the peace of mind of live vehicle tracking through a dedicated app, and the vehicles are held to the same strict safety standards as regular school buses, including smart monitoring and RTA-certified drivers.The ""SUV for students"" move is part of a larger strategy to get 60% of students into shared transport within the next three years. For the average resident, even those without school-age kids, this is a win. Fewer private cars performing U-turns and double-parking at school gates means a smoother flow for everyone during the 7:30 AM rush.Ahmed Hashem Bahrozyan, CEO of the Public Transport Agency, emphasized that the pilot is a ""step-change"" in how Dubai handles daily mobility. If the Al Barsha trial shows a significant drop in congestion, the RTA plans to expand the SUV and pooled bus service to other major school districts across Dubai by the start of the next school year in September 2026.","Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has officially rolled out a pilot program that lets students trade the standard bus seat for a luxury SUV.

Coup In Britain? Starmer’s ‘Own Cabinet Plots’ His Downfall | ‘Full Bunker Mode’ In No. 10





The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true. ""The UK is set to introduce a nationwide curfew, beginning at 11pm each night,"" he appears to say on one of thousands of TikTok videos of him posted in last six months. ""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok. By Dec 19, most appeared to have been removed from the platform. Howard said the use of AI in politics is increasing rapidly. ""We know it's internationally pervasive now,"" he said. ""Four of every five elections around the world now have AI-generated political junk that is unattributed and clearly misleading.

It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Why Chris Do's principles matter now more than ever



Know who you are before asking others to know you.

Choose collaborators who elevate your voice.

Tell your story boldly, beautifully and authentically.





At Dubai’s Billion Followers Summit, the world’s biggest event for digital creators, one of the leading voices in branding and design took to the stage with a clear message that in a crowded digital world, being different is not optional but essential.Chris Do, CEO and Founder of The Futur, a global creative education platform followed by millions, shared his top principles for content creators aiming to build a distinctive identity in an era where anyone with a phone can publish content. His session titled “How to Stand Out in a Noisy World” was one of the highlights of the fourth 1 Billion Followers Summit 2026 in Dubai, an event drawing tens of thousands of creators from around the world under the theme “Content for Good. ”Do’s first principle is deceptively simple: define precisely what you want before trying to build a public persona. In his view, clarity of intent serves as a magnetic force. Once you know your destination, your work naturally aligns with opportunities and audiences. Without that clarity, creators risk mimicking others and blending into the noise.“Don't expect everyone to know you. Instead, you should focus on building a distinctive personality that people will recognise.To build this distinctive personality, there are a number of assets or principles. The first is to define precisely what you want because if you do that, you will find that life organises things for you until you achieve what you want,” Do told the packed audience.The underlying idea here is that identity precedes audience, not the other way around. When creators are consistent in what they stand for, others are far more likely to gravitate toward them, not because their content is everywhere but because it matters somewhere. This kind of intentional positioning builds both followers and loyalty.Next, Do emphasised that the creators who want to make a mark should not shy away from associating with big names in their niche. Rather than playing it safe in isolated corners of the internet, ambitious creators should actively pursue collaborations with people, brands or platforms that already embody excellence in their field.This is not about ego or branding theatrics, it is about strategic visibility. When you align yourself with recognised authorities, your own voice gains credibility by association. For many content creators, the smartest next step is not more posting; it is more worthwhile partnerships.The third and most human of Do’s principles centres on storytelling. For a creator to stand out, audiences must first know you before they engage with what you create. In a world where trends and memes come and go, a creator’s unique story becomes their lasting currency.Do urged creators to have the courage to show opinions that differ from the mainstream, even if they seem strange or unconventional. However, he also stressed that difference must be meaningful, not different for the sake of attention. Authenticity, he argued, is the glue that connects form and substance, bold ideas with beautiful presentation.If your aesthetic and your values align, people don’t just follow you; they remember you. His point reflects a wider industry shift: audiences increasingly reward truth and depth over polished mimicry.Do’s session came against the backdrop of the 1 Billion Followers Summit’s explosive growth. With over 30,000 attendees, 15,000+ creators and 500+ expert speakers from around the world, the event underscores the creator economy’s evolving complexity and influence.As traditional media models continue to shift, with millions of videos uploaded daily and users spending hours on social platforms, creators are discovering that follower counts alone no longer guarantee success. The goal is no longer only visibility but distinctive influence and lasting connection. This idea is echoed by other speakers at the summit, who have urged creators to think beyond virality and focus on purpose, responsibility and real impact in their craft.For aspiring creators and seasoned influencers alike, Do’s framework offers a roadmap out of content fatigue and into meaningful growth:These principles are not tricks or shortcuts; they are foundations for a digital identity that withstands trends and algorithm changes, transforming creators from noise makers into distinctive voices in the global conversation. In a world where anyone can become a creator overnight, enduring influence is built not by copying what’s popular but by defining what’s you. As Chris Do put it in Dubai: clarity, collaboration and courageous storytelling are not just nice to have, they are the keys to standing out in an increasingly crowded world.","Chris Do, CEO and Founder of The Futur, shared his top principles for content creators aiming to build a distinctive identity in an era where anyone with a phone can publish content. His session was one of the highlights of the fourth 1 Billion Followers Summit 2026 in Dubai, an event drawing tens of thousands of creators.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126451488,imgsize-44000,width-400,resizemode-4/chris-do-at-dubai39s-billion-followers-summit-3-essential-principles-for-content-creators-to-stand-out-in-2026.jpg"

Rare Apple devices from different eras

Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings



Posters, paperwork and early marketing

A wide-ranging collection of Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings and some of Apple’s earliest products has gone up for auction as the company approaches its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2026. The sale is being handled by RR Auction, which has opened bidding on 191 items spanning Jobs’ early life and Apple’s formative period in the mid-1970s.Among the centrepieces of the auction is the first known cheque issued by Apple Computer, Inc. on March 16, 1976. Signed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, the $500 cheque was made out to Howard Cantin, who designed the printed circuit board for the Apple-1 computer. The document predates Apple’s official incorporation and is described by the auction house as a foundational artefact from the company’s earliest days.Also drawing strong interest is the earliest known prototype motherboard for the Apple-1, alongside other rare hardware from Apple’s pre-Macintosh era. Early bidding has already pushed some items into the tens of thousands of dollars, with expectations that final prices could climb far higher.The auction also includes a functional Lisa-1 computer, a key transitional machine that preceded Apple’s Macintosh line, as well as a first-generation iPhone that was later jailbroken by teenage hacker George Hotz.Together, the items trace Apple’s evolution from a garage-based start-up to a consumer electronics giant.Adding a more personal dimension, the collection features items from Jobs’ childhood and teenage years, provided to the auction house by his stepbrother, John Chovanec. These include bowties, Bob Dylan 8-track tapes, and the wooden desk from Jobs’ bedroom at the Los Altos, California home later associated with the famed “Apple garage”.Other personal effects include components from Jobs’ own Apple-1 computer, hand-annotated car repair manuals, and a short handwritten note to his father on an early Apple business card.Rounding out the auction are original Apple marketing posters from the 1970s and 1980s, along with internal documents and ephemera from the company’s earliest phase. Together, the items offer a rare, material record of Apple’s origins and the personal world of its co-founder.Bidding for the collection is open until January 29, with interest expected to grow as the anniversary year approaches.","Collection of Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings and some of Apple’s earliest products has gone up for auction as the company approaches its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2026.

Dubai

, January 08, 2026:

What is Dubai's Smart Rental Index?



Why are rent hikes in Dubai regulated in the first place?

Dubai Rent Increases Decoded: What Landlords Don’t Always Tell Tenants

How rent increase limits are calculated in Dubai



0% increase: If your current rent is up to 10% below the market average

5% increase: If it’s 11% to 20% below average

10% increase: If it’s 21% to 30% below average

15% increase: If it’s 31% to 40% below average

20% increase: If it’s more than 40% below average

Step-by-step: How to check if your rent increase is legal in Dubai



Visit the official DLD Rent Index page on the Dubai Land Department website. Enter your Title Deed number or manually key in your property details (area, number of rooms, contract expiry date and current annual rent). The tool calculates the average rent for similar properties nearby. It then shows the maximum legal rent increase allowed under the index bands.

What to do if your Dubai landlord demands too much



Present the official index result to the landlord in writing or via email.

Negotiate based on the legal maximum rather than the landlord’s figure.

File a complaint with the Rental Dispute Centre (RDC) at the Dubai Land Department, where the index can be used as statutory evidence to challenge unfair increases.

Avoid paying more than the legal maximum.

Have evidence for negotiations and disputes.

Bottom line: Rent transparency in Dubai







As Dubai’s rental market continues to evolve amid strong demand and population growth, tenants often grapple with rising rents and the question: Is this rent increase even legal ? Fortunately, the Dubai Land Department’s Smart Rental Index, an AI-powered official tool, now gives residents a clear way to check whether a rent hike proposed by a landlord is justified under UAE law.Whether you are renewing your lease, debating negotiations or simply planning your budget, understanding how rent hikes are regulated in Dubai is essential. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how the system works and how tenants can protect themselves from arbitrary increases.At the core of Dubai’s rent regulation framework is the Smart Rental Index, a sophisticated tool developed by the Dubai Land Department (DLD) to determine fair rental values across the emirate. Unlike the older system, which was updated annually by broad district averages, the Smart Index uses AI and detailed building-level data, including construction quality, services, maintenance standards and location, to produce real-time average rent figures for specific buildings and neighbourhoods.The index covers all residential areas of Dubai, including freehold communities and leasehold zones and helps both tenants and landlords benchmark rental rates against current market conditions.Under Dubai’s tenancy laws (including Decree No. 43 of 2013 and subsequent DLD regulations), landlords cannot arbitrarily raise rent each year. Instead, rent increases are permitted only during lease renewal and only if the Smart Rental Index supports the hike.Importantly, landlords must also provide tenants with a written notice at least 90 days before the expiry of the tenancy contract if they wish to raise rent or change any contract terms. Failing to provide this notice makes the increase invalid under the law, even if the index allows it.These rules are designed to promote market transparency and protect tenants from sudden, excessive rent hikes that could destabilise household finances.Dubai’s rent increase system sets strict limits on how much landlords can legally increase rent, based on how the tenant’s current rent compares with the average market rent shown in the Smart Rental Index -These bands help ensure that rent adjustments are fair and reflect genuine market trends rather than landlord discretion. They are automatically applied by the Smart Rental Index tool when you perform a legal rent check.Tenants in Dubai can easily verify whether a proposed rent increase complies with the official rules by using the online rent calculator provided by the Dubai Land Department:You can access this service via the Dubai REST app, the DLD website under e-services or the DubaiNow app, all of which provide the same official data. Once you have the result, you can print or screenshot the official calculation to use in negotiations with your landlord or, if needed, as evidence in a dispute.If your landlord proposes a rent increase that exceeds the legal limit shown by the Smart Rental Index or fails to give the mandatory 90-day notice, you have options:Tenants have successfully used this process to keep their rent at current levels when the index shows no increase is allowed, demonstrating the tool’s effectiveness.Even if the Smart Rental Index shows your rent qualifies for an increase, the landlord must still serve at least 90 days’ written notice before your tenancy expires. If they don’t, the increase is invalid by law and your rent must remain unchanged for the next contract period.This dual requirement, both index eligibility and timely notice, protects tenants from both unjustified and procedural rent hikes.The Smart Rental Index is not just a protective tool for tenants, it also helps landlords justify their pricing based on clear market data. This transparency can reduce conflicts and support fairer negotiation at renewal time.For tenants, the benefits are clear:For landlords, it standardises expectations and aligns increases with actual market trends, supporting sustainable rental growth across Dubai’s diverse property landscape.Dubai’s Smart Rental Index and the associated legal framework give tenants a powerful and free way to verify whether a rent increase is fair and lawful. Using the official online calculator and understanding the rules around notice periods and permissible increases allows renters to protect themselves from arbitrary hikes while helping landlords set rents that reflect genuine market data.With rent increases now a standard concern for tenants across the emirate, knowing how to use the Smart Rental Index could save tenants thousands of dirhams and reduce rental disputes. It is not just about checking numbers, it is about ensuring fairness, transparency and legal compliance in one of the world’s most dynamic rental markets.",Dubai’s rent increase system sets strict limits on how much landlords can legally increase rent.

The engagement challenge







Netflix is preparing for bringing a redesign of its app as the streaming giant is looking to compete directly with social media platforms for daily user engagement. As reported by TechCrunch, the redesign of the Netflix aims to make the app feel less static library of shows and more like a dynamic, interactive hub. While Netflix remains the world’s largest subscription streaming service, it faces growing competition not just from rival streamers but from social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, which dominate daily attention spans.As per the report, the upcoming redesign of the Netflix app is said to include a personalised feed which will highlight the trending clips, recommendations and interactive prompts. The app is also expected to showcase short-form video previews which will be designed to mimic content style of TikTok. The Netflix app is also tipped to incorporated some interactive features such as polls, quizzes and community discussions related to shows and movies. The app will also focus on daily discovery and will also encourage users to explore beyond their usual watchlist.The challenge faced by Netflix is clear, while users may binge-watch series, they don’t necessarily open the app every day.Social platforms, by contrast, thrive on habitual engagement. By redesigning its app, Netflix hopes to close this gap and position itself as a platform where users spend time even when they’re not watching full episodes or films.The principle of daily engagement plays a crucial role in long-term strategy of Netflix. The frequent app visits could lead to increase retention rate among subscribers. It will also help in boosting advertising opportunities and will also help Netflix in strengthening attention share in an increasingly crowded digital landscape.","Netflix is preparing for bringing a redesign of its app as the streaming giant is looking to compete directly with social media platforms for daily user engagement.

Why OpenAI's ad announcement for users may also be 'bad news' for Google,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-openais-ad-announcement-for-users-may-also-be-bad-news-for-google/articleshow/126849405.cms,"OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is projected to earn a staggering $25 billion in annual advertising revenue by 2030, potentially challenging Google's digital ad market dominance. This ambitious forecast hinges on successful ad integration, offering advertisers access to valuable user intent data. The move could shift marketing budgets if OpenAI crafts helpful, conversational ad experiences.

""in the coming weeks.""

How OpenAI’s ad revenue can help the company compete with Google

“OpenAI's move directly challenges this core revenue stream by offering an alternative, highly engaging platform for users to discover products and services. If ChatGPT can successfully integrate ads that are helpful rather than intrusive, it could siphon off valuable commercial queries that traditionally go to Google,”

“conversational”

“high-intent engagement.”





ChatGPT maker OpenAI is expected to generate $25 billion in annual advertising revenue by 2030. According to predictions made by tech analysts, the expected increase in the AI startup’s ad revenue may potentially pose a threat to Google 's dominance in the digital ad market. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney has claimed that OpenAI may reach that level of annual ad revenue by 2030 if it executes well on rolling out this new business. In a note to investors (seen by Business Insider), Mahaney wrote: “A path to generating several billion dollars in ad revenue in 2026, going to $25B+ by 2030, seems reasonable.”However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on the likely scale of ChatGPT by that time, the proven monetisation of high-intent performance marketing platforms and the current size of this market, the analyst added. Last week, OpenAI announced that free and ChatGPT Go tier subscribers would start seeing adsThe company also outlined its advertising principles, including clearly labelling ads and not sharing user conversations with advertisers.In a recent blog post, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar said that the company’s revenue is growing rapidly. She noted that the startup's annualised revenue topped $20 billion in 2025, up from $2 billion in 2023. However, there are questions over OpenAI's losses and whether it can become profitable in the future.Advertising could be one way for OpenAI to boost its revenue and profits.Mahaney noted that Google's Search and YouTube businesses likely generated close to $300 billion in ad revenue in 2025, with Meta generating an additional $180 billion. These are highly profitable operations, with operating profit margins of 40%, according to the analyst.ChatGPT has almost 1 billion weekly average users, many of whom share valuable details with the chatbot, such as what they want and need. Advertisers are willing to pay for access to this information. This is the type of intent-based information that highlights the significant digital ad businesses run by Google and Meta.OpenAI has said that initial test ads will appear at the bottom of ChatGPT answers and be relevant to the user's conversation with the chatbot. This approach may not be too intrusive for users while still being attractive to advertisers, Mahaney added.Mahaney wrote.The analyst also warned that if OpenAI can develop aad format, where users research and discuss potential purchases within ChatGPT, it could prompt advertisers to shift some of their marketing budgets, as this isEven if ChatGPT fully embraces ads, the chatbot will be far away from taking Google's market share, Mahaney continued.OpenAI will still have to compete with the tech ecosystem Google has spent years building, such as its Chrome web browser, as well as with web users' habit of Googling when they need an answer, Mahaney explained.","ChatGPT maker OpenAI is expected to generate $25 billion in annual advertising revenue by 2030.

Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra launch date (expected)



Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra expected price in India and US



Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra: Display technology and design updates



Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra camera system and imaging upgrades



Battery capacity and charging speed of Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra



Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra: Processor and performance options



Focus on practical improvements



(Disclaimer: All information about the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra's launch date, price, specs, and features comes from leaks and reports from the industry.) Samsung has not officially said these things are true. The final specs, availability, and price may change when the official announcement is made.)





The Galaxy S26 Ultra is Samsung's next high-end smartphone, and the company is getting ready for its release. It will be unveiled at the company's annual Galaxy Unpacked event in February 2026. Multiple leaks from the industry and supply chain reports suggest that the event will take place on February 25, which is a change from Samsung's usual schedule of launching its flagship phones in January. By the middle of March 2026, the Galaxy S26 Ultra should be available in stores.The new device is expected to have better display efficiency, camera performance, battery capacity, and charging speed. The overall design language may still be familiar, but it looks like the focus is on making existing features better rather than adding new ones. Samsung has not yet confirmed the final specs, prices, or launch schedule, so all of the information we have right now comes from leaks and unofficial reports.According to industry reports, Samsung will hold the Galaxy Unpacked event in February 2026. This would be the first time in a few years that Samsung has pushed back the launch of its flagship phone past January. Reports indicate that the new timeline might help the company finish design changes and make sure there is enough stock for markets around the world.Around the middle of March 2026, after the official announcement, stores are expected to start selling them. Like with previous launches, the device will probably be released in stages in different parts of the world.Pricing leaks suggest that the Galaxy S26 Ultra will follow Samsung's trend of charging a lot for its phones. In India, the higher-end models with more RAM and storage could cost between Rs 1,35,000 and Rs 1,70,000. According to reports, the best configuration in this range has 16GB of RAM and 1TB of internal storage.The base Ultra model in the US is expected to cost around $1,299, which is very similar to the prices of the Galaxy S25 Ultra generation. Prices may be different in different areas, due to taxes and storage options.Galaxy S26 Ultra is rumoured to have a 6.9-inch M14 OLED display. This panel should use less energy and be better at controlling brightness than the ones that came before it. Leaks also suggest that there is a built-in privacy feature that limits the angles from which people can see the screen, which helps keep the screen from being seen in public places.Design updates are expected to be subtle. The phone might have a new camera layout on the back, a slimmer profile, and corners that are a little more rounded. The overall shape is likely to stay the same as Samsung's recent Ultra models.The Galaxy S26 Ultra is likely to keep its 200MP main camera sensor from the Galaxy S25. According to reports, lens coatings are getting better to cut down on glare and reflections, and autofocus is getting faster and more accurate.A better ultrawide lens and a telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom should also be part of the camera setup. These improvements are supposed to make pictures clearer, help the camera work better in low light, and make the zoom work the same way no matter what you're shooting.According to reports, the Galaxy S26 Ultra will last between 5,000mAh and 5,400mAh. This increase should help the device last longer, especially when features that use a lot of power are turned on.Reports suggest that wired connections can now charge quickly at 60W. This would be better than older Ultra models, which charged more slowly over a wired connection. There haven't been any leaks that give specifics about wireless charging yet.In some areas, the Galaxy S26 Ultra will likely have Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 processor, which will power its performance. Some markets may get versions with Samsung's Exynos 2600 chipset.Both processors are expected to make the device's performance more efficient, allow for more multitasking, and improve the AI features that are built into the device. The device will probably come with Android 16 and the newest version of Samsung's One UI.Leaks suggest that Samsung's plan for the Galaxy S26 Ultra is to improve the way people use their phones every day. Improvements in battery life, display quality, charging speed, and camera responsiveness show that the focus is on usability and consistency rather than big changes to the look of the device.The Galaxy S26 Ultra is expected to go head-to-head with other flagship smartphones that come out in early 2026. This means that Samsung will be one of the first big companies to release high-end phones in the new year.","The Galaxy S26 Ultra is Samsung's next high-end smartphone.

The New York Times’ Wordle continues to sit quietly inside many people’s daily routines. It rarely takes more than a few minutes, but it asks for full attention while it lasts. Each puzzle offers the same simple task: find a five letter word using no more than six guesses. The appeal comes from its limits. There is only one puzzle a day, and no way to rush ahead. Some days move quickly. Others resist.Wordle #1672 is one of the more deceptive entries. At first glance, it appears manageable, but early guesses can lead in unhelpful directions. Familiar patterns do not settle easily. If progress feels slow, the hints below are designed to narrow the field without giving everything away. The answer appears later for those who want closure or prefer to reset for tomorrow.Wordle challenges players to uncover a hidden five-letter word in six attempts. After each guess, tiles change colour to show how close you are.Using this feedback to refine each new guess is the core of the game.If today’s puzzle is proving stubborn, these clues focus on structure rather than spelling.
