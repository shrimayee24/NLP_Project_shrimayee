What are new features of Amrit Bharat trains?

Get ready for new Amrit Bharat Express trains! Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw recently announced nine new Amrit Bharat Express trains, expanding the network of long-distance passenger services across the country. The upcoming trains will connect West Bengal and Assam with Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, strengthening inter-state rail links.Since the launch of the Amrit Bharat Express in December 2023, 30 services have already become operational, with the network set to grow further with the addition of these new routes.Introduced as a special offering of the Amrit Kaal, the Amrit Bharat Express trains are designed to provide non-air-conditioned long-distance sleeper-class travel at affordable fares.“The new Amrit Bharat trains mark a significant step in improving passenger comfort and connectivity. Other benefits include boosting commerce and tourism!” PM Modi said in a post on X.Ticket prices are around Rs 500 per 1,000 kilometres, with proportionately lower fares for short- and medium-distance journeys. The services aim to connect regions often separated by geography and opportunity.The trains feature modern passenger facilities, including foldable snack tables, mobile phone and bottle holders, radium floor strips, comfortable seating and berths, modern toilets with electro-pneumatic flushing, fire-suppression mechanisms, provisions for divyangjan passengers, fast charging points, pantry cars and provisions for “divyangjan” (differently-abled) passengers.Amrit Bharat Express is a push–pull train featuring non-AC coaches, comprising a mix of general and second-class sleeper coaches. Equipped with push–pull technology, the train offers faster acceleration and deceleration and can run at a maximum speed of 130 kmph. In the coming months, Indian Railways is also expected to roll out Amrit Bharat 3.0, which will include AC coaches.","Amrit Bharat Express is a push–pull train featuring non-AC coaches, comprising a mix of general and second-class sleeper coaches.

The world’s largest beaver dam is so big that you can see it from space,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/the-worlds-largest-beaver-dam-is-so-big-that-you-can-see-it-from-space/articleshow/126520430.cms,"AI-generated

A beaver dam hidden in Canada is clearly visible from space

The actual size of the beaver dam is impressive

This beaver dam was discovered from space

Why beavers build on this scale

What the dam means for the wider park





Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada, which includes northern Alberta and parts of the Northwest Territories, is home to the largest beaver dam ever documented. The structure is located deep within the park, far from roads, towns, and established paths, making it inaccessible by foot. It is so large that it can be seen in satellite photographs from orbit. The dam is approximately 775 metres long at its front edge and spans an area of around 70,000 square metres, keeping back a substantial volume of water. It was initially discovered in 2007 using satellite imaging rather than terrestrial exploration. Further investigation revealed that the dam did not exist before 1980, implying that it was developed over several decades by multiple generations of beavers operating in the same spot.Wood Buffalo National Park lies across northern Alberta and parts of the Northwest Territories. It is the largest national park in Canada and one of the largest protected areas in the world. The beaver dam sits deep within it, far from roads, towns, or marked trails.Reaching the site on foot would take days. The landscape is difficult and slow. Wetlands stretch for long distances. Muskeg gives way under weight. Boreal forest closes in thickly.Most people who have seen the dam up close did not walk there. They arrived by private sightseeing flights, looking down rather than approaching on the ground.According to Parks Canada , from end to end, the front of the dam measures roughly 775 metres. That is close to seven football fields laid side by side. The entire perimeter of the dam area approaches 2,000 metres. Its surface area covers about 70,000 square metres.The pond created behind the dam is thought to be around one metre deep. That would place the volume of water at roughly 70,000 cubic metres. Another way to see it is through scale. A standard dump truck carries about 10 cubic yards. By that measure, the dam holds back the equivalent of more than 90,000 dump trucks of water. Seen as ice, it would fill around 1,600 hockey rinks.According to BBC Wildlife , no explorer stumbled across this dam by chance. No ranger logged it during patrol. It was first noticed in 2007, not on the ground, but in satellite imagery. The structure was large enough to be visible from space.Further images, including those provided by NASA, showed that the dam did not exist before 1980. That suggests it could be up to 45 years old. Over that time, it grew slowly, piece by piece, shaped by water flow and repeated work rather than a single effort. The location helped keep it hidden. With no nearby access routes, there was little reason for people to pass through.Beavers are often described as ecosystem engineers. They change landscapes by design, even if that design follows instinct rather than a plan. By felling trees and packing wood, mud, stones, and vegetation together, they redirect water and create ponds.In the case of this dam, multiple generations of beavers worked on the same structure. Each added material where it was needed. Over time, the dam expanded and strengthened, holding back runoff from the Birch Mountains at the southern edge of the park. The result is not just a barrier but an entire water system shaped by animals rather than machines.Wood Buffalo National Park is known for more than its size. It supports wood bison, whooping cranes, and the Peace Athabasca Delta, one of the largest inland freshwater deltas in the world. The beaver dam fits quietly into that setting.It supports wetlands, slows water movement, and creates habitat for other species. It does not draw crowds or require fences. It simply exists, doing its work out of sight. Even now, most people will never see it directly. The dam remains where it was built, surrounded by forest and water, changing its corner of the park a little at a time.","The beaver dam is located in Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada.

India has the world's only floating national park: Know its location,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/travel/india-has-the-worlds-only-floating-national-park-know-its-location/articleshow/126498802.cms,"AI - generated



Keibul Lamjao: World’s only floating national park in Manipur

Endangered animals depend on this floating park

Nature draws visitors to Keibul Lamjao National Park

How and when can you visit the floating park





Keibul Lamjao National Park, located in Manipur ’s Loktak Lake, holds a distinction unmatched anywhere else in the world. It is the only national park that rests entirely on floating vegetation, rather than fixed land. The park is formed on phumdis, thick natural mats of soil and plant matter that rise and sink with changing water levels. This unusual setting supports a fragile ecosystem and serves as the last natural habitat of the endangered Sangai deer. Though remote, the park has become a point of scientific and conservation interest due to its dependence on the health of the surrounding lake. Water management, climate patterns, and the careful balance between protection and human activity closely shape Keibul Lamjao's future.The base of Keibul Lamjao is made of phumdis, which are thick, layered masses of vegetation. They form naturally when plants decay and bind together with soil and roots. Over the years, these mats grow strong enough to support grasses and reeds, and eventually animals. They drift slightly with changes in water level, lifting during the monsoon and settling lower in drier months. This movement is slow, almost unnoticeable, but it shapes everything above it.Unlike solid ground, the surface feels alive. The health of the park depends on Loktak Lake itself. When water flow changes, the phumdis change too. This fragile balance is why the park is considered unique and also why it remains vulnerable to human interference beyond its boundaries.The most well-known resident of Keibul Lamjao is the Sangai deer. With its slender legs and curved antlers, it moves lightly across the phumdis, almost testing each step. Once believed to be extinct, the species survived only here, hidden within the floating grasslands. Its presence is tied closely to the condition of the park. Alongside the Sangai, smaller populations of hog deer are found, as well as otters that slip quietly through the water channels. Birds arrive and leave with the seasons. Some stay; others pass through during migration. Their calls fill the early mornings, then fade by afternoon. None of these animals could exist here without the lake, and none could survive if the phumdis were to disappear.People come here less for spectacle and more for atmosphere. There are watch towers where visitors stand and wait, often longer than expected. Mist moves across the lake in the early hours, hiding and revealing shapes without hurry. When a deer appears, it does not perform. It grazes, lifts its head, and moves on. Boats cut slowly through narrow channels, careful not to disturb the floating ground. The landscape feels open yet contained, quiet but not empty. There are no marked trails in the usual sense, because the land itself shifts. What stays with many visitors is not a single sight, but the sense of standing somewhere that does not quite behave like land or water, but something in between.The park is about 45 kilometres from Imphal, the capital of Manipur. Most visitors arrive by air, then continue by road towards Loktak Lake. The best months to visit are between November and March, when the weather is cooler, and water levels are more stable. During the monsoon, the lake swells and restricts movement, making access difficult. Local guides are important here, not only for navigation but also for understanding what can and cannot be done on floating ground. Rules are strict, and for good reason. Keibul Lamjao is not built to absorb pressure. It holds together quietly, as long as it is allowed to. When the day ends, the lake settles again, carrying the park with it.","Keibul Lamjao National Park is located in Manipur ’s Loktak Lake.

Northern lights may drift across US skies this week: Know where to spot them,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/northern-lights-may-drift-across-us-skies-this-week-know-where-to-spot-them/articleshow/126418902.cms,"Northern lights may drift across US skies this week: Know where to spot them

Which US states are most likely to see the Nothern lights this week

Washington

Montana

North Dakota

South Dakota also falls well within the viewing zone for this event.

Can people farther south see anything at all

What is causing this aurora event

Clouds and city lights change the experience





Northern skies do not usually proclaim themselves. Most nights are calm, even when something faraway moves above the earth. This week is little different. A pulse of solar activity is travelling across Earth's magnetic field, and this change could be enough to bring the northern lights into view in portions of the United States. It is not guaranteed, and it will not appear the same everywhere. Some people may notice a gentle tint on the horizon, while others may see nothing. However, for a brief period in early January, the odds shift somewhat. Space weather forecasters and sky watchers are keeping a tight eye on the darkness, hoping it may reveal something unexpected rather than being empty for once during the harshest stretch of winter evenings.The strongest chances sit far north, as they usually do. Alaska remains the most reliable place, almost separate from the rest of the map when it comes to aurora watching. Parts of:These areas lie closer to where Earth’s magnetic field funnels charged particles into the atmosphere. NOAA forecasts suggest activity could peak overnight between January 8 and January 9, though timing often slips by hours. In these states, the lights may form brighter arcs or slow-moving curtains rather than faint smudges.Even then, nothing is promised. Auroras are known for appearing briefly and fading without warning.States just below the typical aurora belt are not completely out of luck. Minnesota, Michigan, and Maine frequently find themselves on the verge of a moderate geomagnetic storm, and this week may be no exception. The exhibit in these sites is typically understated. Colours may appear washed out, closer to grey than green. It frequently remains low in the northern sky, easily mistaken for a cloud or distant glow. Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire, and sections of New York fall under the same category. Seeing the aurora typically requires patience and expectations on the part of viewers. Many who do notice it do so only later, when images reveal more than the naked eye could see at the time.The trigger comes from the Sun, though not in a dramatic, cinematic way. A coronal mass ejection has sent a stream of charged particles outward, interacting with a co rotating interaction region already moving through space. Together, they disturb Earth’s magnetic field just enough to produce a G1-level geomagnetic storm. That rating is considered minor, but minor does not mean invisible. It simply means effects are more local and less intense. Space weather remains difficult to predict with precision. Solar wind speed, density, and direction can all shift suddenly. Forecasts improve as the storm arrives, but uncertainty never fully disappears.Even the strongest aurora means little under thick cloud. Cloud cover remains the biggest reason people miss these events, regardless of solar activity. Clear skies matter more than most other factors. Light pollution is the next obstacle. Urban lighting can wash out faint auroras entirely, especially in southern locations. Rural areas, coastal stretches, and dark sky parks offer better odds. Many experienced observers suggest letting your eyes adjust and avoiding phone screens for a while. Cameras often see more than humans do, especially in low light modes. Sometimes the night still looks empty. Sometimes it does not. That uncertainty is part of the pull.","The strongest chances sit far north, as they usually do.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to engineers: I want you to stop coding and start...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-to-engineers-i-want-you-to-stop-coding-and-start-/articleshow/126543905.cms,"Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang aims for engineers to code zero percent, leveraging AI assistants like Cursor to tackle complex, undiscovered problems. He believes this 'Purpose vs Task' approach, akin to radiology's evolution, will elevate human roles. While some, like Cursor's CEO, caution against unchecked AI development, Huang remains confident in this human-centric future for innovation.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Why radiologists didn't disappear, and why engineers might not either

Vibe coding pioneers warn Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ’s approach has limits





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wants his engineers to spend exactly zero percent of their time writing code. In a recent appearance on the No Priors AI podcast, Huang revealed that every engineer at the $3 trillion chipmaker now uses Cursor, an AI coding assistant, throughout their workday. His goal? Free them entirely from what he calls 'syntax' so they can focus on finding and solving problems that haven't been cracked yet.""Nothing would give me more joy than if none of our engineers were coding at all,"" Huang said. ""And they were just purely solving undiscovered problems.""This isn't just philosophical musing. Huang has been pushing a framework he calls 'Purpose vs Task' across multiple interviews in recent months, including a viral appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience. The idea is simple: coding is the task, but discovering and solving novel problems is the purpose. AI should handle the former so humans can concentrate on the latter.Huang points to radiology as proof this approach creates jobs rather than eliminates them. Years ago, AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton predicted radiologists would be obsolete within five years because computers could scan images faster than humans. Instead, radiologist numbers have grown.The reason, Huang argues, is that reading scans was always just a task—the real purpose is diagnosing disease and improving patient outcomes. When AI took over the grunt work, demand for the human expertise behind it actually expanded.At Nvidia's recent all-hands meeting, Huang reportedly pushed back hard against managers who were telling teams to dial back AI usage. ""Are you insane?"" he said, according to Business Insider. He promised employees they'd still have work to do—just more ambitious work.Not everyone shares Huang's unbridled optimism. Michael Truell, CEO of Cursor itself—the $29 billion startup whose AI tool Nvidia has embraced—recently cautioned against 'vibe coding,' where developers let AI build software without reviewing the output. ""If you close your eyes and don't look at the code and have AIs build things with shaky foundations, things start to kind of crumble,"" Truell told Fortune's Brainstorm AI conference.Even Andrej Karpathy, the former Tesla AI director who coined the term 'vibe coding,' admitted his recent Nanochat project was ""basically entirely hand-written"" because AI agents ""just didn't work well enough."" He recently warned fellow programmers: ""I've never felt this much behind. The profession is being dramatically refactored.""For now, Huang's betting big that humans who focus on purpose rather than tasks will come out ahead. Whether that bet pays off for the millions of developers who actually write code for a living remains the undiscovered problem.","Jensen Huang, CEO of $3 trillion chipmaker Nvidia, wants his engineers to spend zero percent of their time writing code.

All three were previously employees at OpenAI and will now return to OpenAI after their exit in 2024 to start the AI firm.Now, two narratives have formed about Barret Zoph’s exit from Thinking Machines Lab.One of the two narratives we talked above is what Fidji Simo, CEO of applications at OpenAI shared online. In a welcome post, Somo says that the exit “has been in the works for several weeks”.“Excited to welcome Barret Zoph, Luke Metz, and Sam Schoenholz back to OpenAI! This has been in the works for several weeks, and we’re thrilled to have them join the team.Barret will report to me; Luke and Sam will report into Barret. More to come on what they’ll focus on soon!,” she wrote in the post.According to a Wired report, Simo also sent a memo to staff where she claimed that Zoph was considering leaving and was eventually ‘fired’ on Wednesday, January 14. In the memo, Simo says that OpenAI doesn’t share the “same concerns” about Zoph as Thinking Machines Lab CEO Mira Murati.The concerns, which is also the second narrative, included “unethical conduct” on Zoph’s part where he allegedly shared confidential information with the competitors, as claimed by technology reporter Kylie Robison quoting a source close to Thinking Machines.While this personnel is a major blow to Thinking Machines Lab that lost another co-founder, Andrew Tulloch, in November last year. It is a win for ChatGPT maker OpenAI facing ‘big crisis’ amid key executives' departure and the recently announced Apple-Google Gemini deal to power next-generation Siri. OpenAI VP of research Jerry Tworek recently told staff that he’s leaving the company, and shared his exit note publicly on X.Phil Chen, Member of Technical Staff at OpenAI announced that today is his last day at the company.","Mira Murati has confirmed that chief technology officer of her AI startup Thinking Machines Lab, Barret Zoph is leaving.

Grok AI restricts image editing features to paid X users

Elon Musk warns, ‘Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will …’





Grok the AI chatbot of Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence firm xAI will no longer be able to generate sexualised or revealing images of real people. The company took this decision after the mounting criticism and regulatory scrutiny. In a post blog post share on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the company company confirmed that it has implemented technological measures in to order to prevent Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people. This move of the company comes after Grok users were exploiting the tool to create AI deepfakes of women and minors, undressing them in manipulated images.California Attorney General Rob Bonta revealed he had launched an investigation into Grok’s role in producing sexualized deepfakes, citing a flood of complaints in recent weeks. Meanwhile, Indonesia and Malaysia suspended Grok entirely, becoming the first countries to ban the tool. Lawmakers in the UK have also publicly considered a suspension.In a statement posted on X’s safety account the company wrote:Recently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok, integrated into his social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), has now announced that its image generation and editing tools will now be restricted to paying subscribers. Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers. You can subscribe to unlock these features,” Grok posted late January 8, linking to X’s premium membership page.Elon Musk said that anyone using AI chatbot Grok to make illegal content on his platform X (formerly known as Twitter) will be punished. Musk’s comments came after the chatbot – hardwired into X came under fire for producing obscene/ non-consensual images, including women and children. In an online post, the tech billionaire wrote “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content”. The Tesla CEO was responding to a post on “inappropriate images” generated by grok.DogeDesigner, followed by Elon Musk wrote in the post: “Some people are saying Grok is creating inappropriate images. But that’s like blaming a pen for writing something bad. A pen doesn’t decide what gets written. The person holding it does. Grok works the same way. What you get depends a lot on what you put in.

All is not well between Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Meta's highest-paid employee as the company's new reporting structure shows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/all-is-not-well-between-meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-and-metas-highest-paid-employee-as-the-companys-new-reporting-structure-shows/articleshow/126526041.cms,"Meta's new structure reveals tension between Mark Zuckerberg and Alexandr Wang, the $14 billion AI recruit. Wang finds Zuckerberg's micromanagement stifling, while staff question his leadership for Meta's AI ambitions. A recent strategy clash highlighted differing priorities, with Wang pushing for cutting-edge AI over immediate product integration.

Wang's inexperience becomes liability for Mark Zuckerberg as AI race intensifies

Meta reorganizes infrastructure chain of command above Wang





Meta's newest reporting structure is exposing something leadership has tried to hide—friction between CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his highest-paid employee, Alexandr Wang. Multiple sources close to the company reveal that Wang, the 28-year-old founder Zuckerberg recruited for $14 billion, finds the CEO's hands-on management suffocating. At the same time, current staff question whether Wang has the chops to lead Meta's $600 billion AI bet.The tension surfaced this fall during a crucial meeting. Wang's TBD Lab team and longtime executives Chris Cox and Andrew Bosworth clashed over strategy. Cox and Bosworth wanted Wang's new AI model trained on Instagram and Facebook data to boost the company's core advertising business. Wang pushed back hard. He argued the goal should be catching up to OpenAI and Google's models first, worrying that customizing training for product tasks would slow progress.It's an us-versus-them mentality that's become impossible to ignore inside Meta. Wang's researchers view the old guard as mere product managers stuck in the social media era. They're chasing superintelligence while everyone else cares about feeds and ads. Some staff even questioned whether $2 billion was quietly shifted from Bosworth's Reality Labs budget to Wang's team—though Meta's spokesperson denied the figure, the whispers persist.The cracks widened when Yann LeCun, Meta's legendary AI scientist and a Turing Award winner, bolted in November rather than report to Wang. Sources say LeCun bristled at serving under someone whose background was data labeling, not cutting-edge AI research. Before that, Nat Friedman, another big hire, faced pressure to move faster. The rushed launch of Vibes, Meta's AI video feed, frustrated his team who felt forced to compete with OpenAI's Sora before they were ready.Wang told associates that Zuckerberg's micromanagement feels suffocating. Yet here's the irony—Zuckerberg hired him specifically because he needed someone he could control, someone young and ambitious enough to execute his vision of ""personal superintelligence."" The CEO's reputation for obsessing over chosen projects means TBD Lab gets his undivided attention. That laser focus looks less like support and more like surveillance.This week, Zuckerberg announced Meta Compute, a new top-level initiative reporting directly to him. He's putting Santosh Janardhan and Daniel Gross in charge, with Dina Powell McCormick handling government relations. The move effectively centralizes infrastructure decisions above Wang, suggesting Zuckerberg wants tighter control as Meta burns through billions. If Wang thought he had autonomy, this announcement proved otherwise. Meta's trajectory suggests Zuckerberg's betting everything on AI—and he's not delegating that to a 28-year-old anymore.The restructuring carries real risks. Wang's TBD Lab only lost two researchers during their first vesting period in November, suggesting the team still has some loyalty. But the organizational shuffle sends a message that nobody—not even the $14 billion hire—operates without Zuckerberg's constant oversight. Scale AI, the startup Zuckerberg invested in to poach Wang, is already losing credibility in the market. Private investors have slashed its valuation from $29 billion to as low as $7.3 billion. If Wang's leadership at Meta falters, it raises uncomfortable questions: did Zuckerberg overpay for the wrong person, or is he simply incapable of trusting anyone with real power?","Alexandr Wang, Meta's highest-paid employee, finds Mark Zuckerberg's hands-on management suffocating.

Q: How can I start career cushioning?

Q: What are some examples of career cushioning?

Q: Is career cushioning only for people in certain industries?

Q: How often should I review and update my career cushioning efforts?

Q: How do I know if my career cushioning efforts are working?

Q: How much time should I be dedicating to career cushioning?

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

What is the Multiple-Trip Exit Permit ?

How to Apply

Log in to the “Ashal” portal for companies and manpower services or use the “Sahel Business/Individuals” app.

Select the type of permit: single-trip or multiple-trip.

Enter the start and end dates for the permit.

Submit the request. The system immediately provides a transaction number and shows the application status.

For employers granting pre-approval: go to pre-approval management, search for registered workers, select the required individuals, and click “add” to finalize.

Why it matters





Kuwait has launched a new digital exit permit system that lets a single permit cover multiple trips abroad. The initiative aims to simplify travel procedures, reduce paperwork, and save time for both employees and employers.The Multiple-Trip Exit Permit is a new service launched by the Public Authority for Manpower (PAM) as part of Kuwait’s ongoing digital transformation of government services. Previously, workers needed a separate permit for each trip abroad, requiring repeated applications, approvals, and paperwork.With the upgraded system, a single permit can cover multiple journeys within a specified period. This change streamlines travel for employees and reduces administrative tasks for employers. The service is fully digital and electronically linked with the Ministry of Interior, so once a permit is approved, the information is automatically transmitted to the relevant authorities. Employers and workers can also print the approved permit at any time, offering flexibility and convenience.The system also allows employers to grant automatic pre-approval for exit permits. Pre-approval can be applied to a single worker, a selected group, or all workers under a specific license.There is also an exception option, enabling employers to exclude certain individuals while granting pre-approval to everyone else. Employers retain complete control and can modify, suspend, or cancel pre-approvals at any time.Applying for the Multiple-Trip Exit Permit is simple and fully digital. The steps are:The new exit permit system is part of PAM’s broader efforts to modernize labour services and enhance digital government solutions. By allowing a single permit to cover multiple trips, the system reduces repeated paperwork for both employers and workers and speeds up approvals, making service delivery faster and more efficient. It also gives employers greater flexibility and control over their workforce, while supporting Kuwait’s ongoing digital transformation initiatives. Overall, the upgrade ensures smoother workflows, faster processing, and a more streamlined experience, making worker travel simpler and more predictable.","Kuwait introduced a digital multiple-trip exit permit allowing workers repeated travel with one approval, reducing paperwork.

How the UAE built the World’s leading Arabic AI Model: Falcon-H1 Arabic explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/how-the-uae-built-the-worlds-leading-arabic-ai-model-falcon-h1-arabic-explained/articleshow/126541445.cms,"UAE’s homegrown Falcon-H1 Arabic AI model shatters global benchmarks / AI Generated Image

What is the UAE’s Falcon-H1 Arabic model?

The 3B model reportedly outperforms Microsoft’s Phi-4 Mini on Arabic-language tasks.

The 7B version ranks among the strongest mid-size Arabic models currently available.

The 34B model has demonstrated higher accuracy than larger competitors on tests covering reasoning, comprehension, dialect recognition, and linguistic depth.

Built Arabic-first, not adapted later

Practical implications

Legal and medical analysis: With a reported 256,000-token context window, the model can process lengthy documents such as contracts or extensive medical records without losing earlier context.

Education: Arabic-language tutoring systems could benefit from stronger alignment with local curricula and language usage

Government and customer services: Automated systems may deliver more accurate responses in Arabic, including regional dialects, for routine public services.

UAE’s broader AI strategy





In a move that has drawn global attention across technology circles, Abu Dhabi’s Technology Innovation Institute (TII) has launched Falcon-H1 Arabic, a new Arabic-focused large language model. While not positioned as a general-purpose global AI, the model is being presented as a significant step forward for Arabic-language artificial intelligence.The flagship 34-billion-parameter version has reportedly secured the top position on the Open Arabic LLM Leaderboard (OALL), outperforming several larger international models in Arabic-specific benchmarks. According to published results, Falcon-H1 (34B) exceeded the performance of models such as Meta’s Llama-3.3 (70B) and Alibaba’s Qwen2.5 (72B) on tasks measuring Arabic comprehension, reasoning, and dialect handling.In AI development, parameter count is often associated with stronger performance. However, Falcon-H1’s results suggest that model architecture and language-specific training can play a decisive role, potentially allowing smaller models to compete with larger systems more efficiently.Falcon-H1 Arabic has been released in three sizes, 3B, 7B, and 34B parameters, designed to support a range of use cases, from lightweight applications to large institutional deployments.According to benchmark data shared by TII:Researchers note that these results are not solely about benchmark scores, but also about how the model handles long-form context, semantic understanding, and culturally grounded language use, rather than relying on literal translation patterns.Unlike many global AI systems that are primarily trained on English data and later adapted for Arabic, Falcon-H1 was designed with an Arabic-first training approach. It uses a hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture, which, according to TII, allows the model to better manage Arabic’s complex morphology, sentence structures, and regional variations.The model is reported to perform consistently across Modern Standard Arabic as well as commonly used dialects from different parts of the Arab world. Developers say this enables it to better interpret context, honorifics, idiomatic expressions, and informal speech patterns that often challenge general-purpose models.Beyond language tasks, Falcon-H1 has also shown competitive performance in STEM-related reasoning benchmarks, suggesting broader applicability beyond translation or text generation.For users and organisations, Falcon-H1’s relatively smaller size compared to competing models may offer practical advantages. Because it requires less computational power, it can be deployed at lower cost and with faster response times, making it more accessible for regional businesses and public-sector use.Potential applications include:While large-scale adoption will depend on real-world testing, developers say these capabilities could help close gaps where existing AI tools have struggled with Arabic-language accuracy.The launch of Falcon-H1 Arabic aligns with the UAE’s broader push to develop sovereign AI capabilities, reducing reliance on foreign-developed models that may not fully reflect regional languages or cultural contexts. Industry observers note that such efforts place the UAE among a small group of countries investing heavily in foundational AI infrastructure.Commenting on the launch, H.E. Faisal Al Bannai, Adviser to the UAE President and Secretary-General of ATRC, said Falcon-H1 Arabic reflects the country’s ambition to strengthen its role in responsible AI development. TII CEO Dr. Najwa Aaraj added that the model aims to address gaps where existing systems fall short for Arabic-speaking communities.Rather than positioning Falcon-H1 as a replacement for global AI systems, officials describe it as a specialised model designed to complement them, offering improved performance in Arabic-language and region-specific use cases.","UAE’s Technology Innovation Institute (TII) has launched Falcon-H1 Arabic, a new Arabic-focused large language model.

If a property owner receives a notification for a contract they did not approve or recognize, they can take prompt action to address the issue.In such cases, owners are able to cancel the associated residency directly through the Sahel application using the “Cancel Residents” service, which PACI has also referred to as the “Remote Residents” service.As an alternative, property owners may visit PACI’s headquarters in person to complete the required procedures.The authority said the new service enhances monitoring of rental contracts across Kuwait and plays a key role in preventing the misuse of residential addresses. By ensuring that residency information tied to properties is current and accurate, PACI aims to reduce unauthorized registrations and improve the reliability of national civil data.PACI explained that the introduction of the Residence Notification service is part of its broader efforts to digitize public services, improve data accuracy, and strengthen coordination between government entities. Officials noted that the initiative supports the government’s wider strategy to build integrated digital platforms that improve efficiency, transparency, and overall user experience for both citizens and residents.","The Public Authority for Civil Information announced the launch of its new “Residence Notification” service through the unified government application Sahel.

Dubai’s Palm Monorail halts service indefinitely: 5 best alternative routes to get around Palm Jumeirah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubais-palm-monorail-halts-service-indefinitely-5-best-alternative-routes-to-get-around-palm-jumeirah/articleshow/126484934.cms,"Dubai Palm Monorail Suspended Indefinitely for Maintenance: 5 Best Alternative Routes You Need to Know

Palm Monorail: From iconic connector to maintenance standstill



Israel On HIGH ALERT As Trump ‘FINALISES’ US Attack On Iran Amid Bloody Khamenei Crackdown | Watch

What’s behind Palm Monorail's closure?



Extended maintenance resulting in major upgrades to stations, track infrastructure or vehicle systems.

Partial reopening first, serving select peak hours or routes before full reinstatement.

Integration with future transit plans, potentially tying to expanded urban transport networks like the Dubai Metro Red Line extensions (long-term conceptual plans have discussed broader connectivity between the Palm and mainland transit)

Dubai commuters adjust with alternatives



Taxis and Ride-Hailing Apps (Fastest and Most Convenient): Best for tourists, families, hotel guests, short stays, taxis remain the most direct and time-efficient option to reach hotels, beach clubs and attractions across Palm Jumeirah. They are widely available across Dubai with drop-off directly at Atlantis, The Pointe, Nakheel Mall and hotels. They are ideal during hot weather or peak tourist season. Tip: During weekends and evenings, allow extra time due to traffic at Palm entry points. RTA Buses (Budget-Friendly Option): Best for budget travellers and daily commuters, Dubai’s public buses continue to serve Palm Jumeirah and nearby areas. Bus routes connect Palm Gateway with Dubai Tram and Metro stations, have affordable fares using Nol cards and are reliable but slower than taxis. Tip: Expect longer travel times during peak hours, especially in winter tourism season. Dubai Tram and Taxi Combination (Balanced Option): Best for visitors staying near Dubai Marina or JBR, take the Dubai Tram to Palm Jumeirah Gateway and switch to a taxi for internal Palm travel. This option balances cost and convenience, especially for those already near tram routes. Private Cars and Hotel Shuttles (Most Flexible): These are best for residents, long-term visitors and hotel guests. Many hotels on the Palm offer complimentary shuttle services. Private cars allow flexibility but can face congestion at peak times. Parking is available at major attractions like Atlantis and Nakheel Mall. Tip: Check hotel shuttle schedules in advance to avoid waiting times. Water Transport (Scenic, Limited Availability): Best for leisure travellers, some operators offer water taxis and private boat services connecting the Palm with Marina or mainland Dubai. These are scenic and relaxing with limited routes and schedules but are typically more expensive than land transport

Key advice for travellers

Re-evaluate peak-day plans to allow extra travel time across Palm Jumeirah.

Use taxis or buses from Palm stations to reach Atlantis, Aquaventure and other attractions.

Check official social channels frequently, as operators have pledged to update passengers once service resumes. Follow official Palm Monorail channels for reopening updates.

Plan extra time for Palm journeys during weekends and evenings.

Check hotel transport options before booking taxis.

If visiting Atlantis or Aquaventure, taxis remain the simplest option





Dubai’s iconic Palm Monorail, the first monorail in the Middle East and a key people-mover on Palm Jumeirah Island, has suspended operations indefinitely for essential maintenance work, leaving locals and tourists alike in transit limbo as the route connecting the Palm to the mainland remains closed with no confirmed reopening date. The announcement came via the monorail’s official channels, with operators confirming that station maintenance is the reason behind the service stoppage. While riders and commuters await updates, alternative transport like taxis, buses and private vehicles have become the de facto way to traverse the popular destination.The Palm Monorail, which first opened in April 2009 and runs approximately 5.45 km across the famed Palm Jumeirah to Atlantis Aquaventure Resort, has served residents, hotel guests and visitors for over 16 years. Designed as a scenic and efficient link across the inland portion of the man-made island, it features four stations and was operated by UK-based transport firm Serco.This suspension marks one of the most significant disruptions to the fleet since its launch and critically, there is currently no timeline for service resumption. While the monorail has historically played a niche role in the city’s broader transit ecosystem (with other heavy traffic handled by road vehicles and the Dubai Metro), it has nonetheless been a memorable part of the Palm experience, often recommended by guides and included in visitor itineraries.According to official statements and travel reports, the shutdown is due to ongoing station maintenance across the monorail network. The operators emphasised that this maintenance is vital to ensure long-term efficiency and safety. It is a necessity for infrastructure nearing two decades of operation.However, there are no published details about the scope, duration or specific technical issues being addressed and a reopening date has not been announced. The lack of a firm timeline has caught many by surprise, including frequent riders and tourists planning visits during Dubai’s peak travel months.For tourists, the monorail was not only functional but scenic and offered elevated views of the Palm trunk, fronds and skyline beyond. Its absence removes one of the region’s most visually distinctive transport experiences, with many visitors now questioning whether a Palm Jumeirah visit will feel less complete without it.Dubai’s transport ecosystem continues to accommodate tens of thousands of daily commuters via roads, ferries, the Dubai Metro and buses, but the monorail’s suspension, especially without a reopening timeline, has created a sense of uncertainty for travel planners and local enthusiasts alike. Unlike typical ride or track refurbishments in theme parks or transit systems worldwide, where scheduled closures often come with reopening forecasts, Dubai’s monorail maintenance appears to be in a more fluid or potentially extensive phase.For instance, other major attractions that undergo periodic maintenance (such as aerial tramways elsewhere) often announce specific closure windows and reopening dates well in advance. The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway in California, for example, closed for its annual maintenance and clearly communicated both start and reparative timelines months before reopening.By contrast, the Palm Monorail closure has only been explained as a maintenance necessity, with no estimated timeline distributed so far. It is a situation that could hint at deeper or more unpredictable engineering work underway. There are a few possible scenarios for the Palm Monorail’s future:While operators have not issued such updates, Dubai’s dynamic urban growth suggests that transport infrastructure will continue to evolve, and the monorail, as a symbolic and strategic asset, may yet be refashioned to play a renewed role once technical work is complete.With Dubai’s Palm Monorail suspended indefinitely for maintenance, residents and visitors heading to Palm Jumeirah will need to rely on alternative transport options. Here’s a simple guide to the fastest, easiest and most practical ways to move around the Palm while the monorail remains out of service.Though these options maintain mobility, riders have noted longer transit times, especially during rush hours or high-season tourism peaks. Some social media users have expressed frustration at the lack of clarity about when the monorail might return, underscoring how the system is valued both as transport and as a leisure experience.For visitors planning Dubai itineraries in early 2026, the monorail closure means:The Palm Monorail, a once-celebrated urban transport highlight, is out of service for essential maintenance with no reopening date yet. The closure underscores both Dubai’s commitment to long-term safety and the challenges of sustaining ageing transport systems in a rapidly growing city.Though seemingly minor in the grand scheme of Dubai’s transport network, the monorail’s indefinite suspension stands as a reminder that iconic infrastructure sometimes needs serious upkeep and that even world-class cities must balance maintenance demands with high expectations from residents and visitors alike. While the Palm Monorail remains closed with no reopening date announced, Palm Jumeirah is still fully accessible.Taxis and buses are currently the most reliable alternatives, while tram links and hotel shuttles help bridge the gap. With a bit of planning, getting around the Palm remains smooth, even without its iconic monorail.","Dubai's iconic Palm Monorail has suspended operations indefinitely for essential maintenance work.

Coup In Britain? Starmer’s ‘Own Cabinet Plots’ His Downfall | ‘Full Bunker Mode’ In No. 10





The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true. ""The UK is set to introduce a nationwide curfew, beginning at 11pm each night,"" he appears to say on one of thousands of TikTok videos of him posted in last six months. ""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok. By Dec 19, most appeared to have been removed from the platform. Howard said the use of AI in politics is increasing rapidly. ""We know it's internationally pervasive now,"" he said. ""Four of every five elections around the world now have AI-generated political junk that is unattributed and clearly misleading.

It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

If you have any queries for Dhirendra Kumar you can drop us an email at: toi.business@timesinternet.in

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough. A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126072870,imgsize-47970,width-400,resizemode-4/saving-and-investing.jpg"

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

His session titled “How to Stand Out in a Noisy World” was one of the highlights of the fourth 1 Billion Followers Summit 2026 in Dubai, an event drawing tens of thousands of creators from around the world under the theme “Content for Good. ”Do’s first principle is deceptively simple: define precisely what you want before trying to build a public persona. In his view, clarity of intent serves as a magnetic force. Once you know your destination, your work naturally aligns with opportunities and audiences. Without that clarity, creators risk mimicking others and blending into the noise.“Don't expect everyone to know you. Instead, you should focus on building a distinctive personality that people will recognise.To build this distinctive personality, there are a number of assets or principles. The first is to define precisely what you want because if you do that, you will find that life organises things for you until you achieve what you want,” Do told the packed audience.The underlying idea here is that identity precedes audience, not the other way around. When creators are consistent in what they stand for, others are far more likely to gravitate toward them, not because their content is everywhere but because it matters somewhere. This kind of intentional positioning builds both followers and loyalty.Next, Do emphasised that the creators who want to make a mark should not shy away from associating with big names in their niche. Rather than playing it safe in isolated corners of the internet, ambitious creators should actively pursue collaborations with people, brands or platforms that already embody excellence in their field.This is not about ego or branding theatrics, it is about strategic visibility. When you align yourself with recognised authorities, your own voice gains credibility by association. For many content creators, the smartest next step is not more posting; it is more worthwhile partnerships.The third and most human of Do’s principles centres on storytelling. For a creator to stand out, audiences must first know you before they engage with what you create. In a world where trends and memes come and go, a creator’s unique story becomes their lasting currency.Do urged creators to have the courage to show opinions that differ from the mainstream, even if they seem strange or unconventional. However, he also stressed that difference must be meaningful, not different for the sake of attention. Authenticity, he argued, is the glue that connects form and substance, bold ideas with beautiful presentation.If your aesthetic and your values align, people don’t just follow you; they remember you. His point reflects a wider industry shift: audiences increasingly reward truth and depth over polished mimicry.Do’s session came against the backdrop of the 1 Billion Followers Summit’s explosive growth. With over 30,000 attendees, 15,000+ creators and 500+ expert speakers from around the world, the event underscores the creator economy’s evolving complexity and influence.As traditional media models continue to shift, with millions of videos uploaded daily and users spending hours on social platforms, creators are discovering that follower counts alone no longer guarantee success. The goal is no longer only visibility but distinctive influence and lasting connection. This idea is echoed by other speakers at the summit, who have urged creators to think beyond virality and focus on purpose, responsibility and real impact in their craft.For aspiring creators and seasoned influencers alike, Do’s framework offers a roadmap out of content fatigue and into meaningful growth:These principles are not tricks or shortcuts; they are foundations for a digital identity that withstands trends and algorithm changes, transforming creators from noise makers into distinctive voices in the global conversation. In a world where anyone can become a creator overnight, enduring influence is built not by copying what’s popular but by defining what’s you. As Chris Do put it in Dubai: clarity, collaboration and courageous storytelling are not just nice to have, they are the keys to standing out in an increasingly crowded world.","Chris Do, CEO and Founder of The Futur, shared his top principles for content creators aiming to build a distinctive identity in an era where anyone with a phone can publish content.

Rare Apple devices from different eras

Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings



Posters, paperwork and early marketing

A wide-ranging collection of Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings and some of Apple’s earliest products has gone up for auction as the company approaches its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2026. The sale is being handled by RR Auction, which has opened bidding on 191 items spanning Jobs’ early life and Apple’s formative period in the mid-1970s.Among the centrepieces of the auction is the first known cheque issued by Apple Computer, Inc. on March 16, 1976. Signed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, the $500 cheque was made out to Howard Cantin, who designed the printed circuit board for the Apple-1 computer. The document predates Apple’s official incorporation and is described by the auction house as a foundational artefact from the company’s earliest days.Also drawing strong interest is the earliest known prototype motherboard for the Apple-1, alongside other rare hardware from Apple’s pre-Macintosh era. Early bidding has already pushed some items into the tens of thousands of dollars, with expectations that final prices could climb far higher.The auction also includes a functional Lisa-1 computer, a key transitional machine that preceded Apple’s Macintosh line, as well as a first-generation iPhone that was later jailbroken by teenage hacker George Hotz.Together, the items trace Apple’s evolution from a garage-based start-up to a consumer electronics giant.Adding a more personal dimension, the collection features items from Jobs’ childhood and teenage years, provided to the auction house by his stepbrother, John Chovanec. These include bowties, Bob Dylan 8-track tapes, and the wooden desk from Jobs’ bedroom at the Los Altos, California home later associated with the famed “Apple garage”.Other personal effects include components from Jobs’ own Apple-1 computer, hand-annotated car repair manuals, and a short handwritten note to his father on an early Apple business card.Rounding out the auction are original Apple marketing posters from the 1970s and 1980s, along with internal documents and ephemera from the company’s earliest phase. Together, the items offer a rare, material record of Apple’s origins and the personal world of its co-founder.Bidding for the collection is open until January 29, with interest expected to grow as the anniversary year approaches.","Collection of Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings and some of Apple’s earliest products has gone up for auction as the company approaches its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2026.

"Quote of the day by Jensen Huang: “I very seldom fire people, I’d rather torture them to greatness”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/quote-of-the-day-by-jensen-huang-i-very-seldom-fire-people-id-rather-torture-them-to-greatness/articleshow/126489810.cms,"NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang

“I very seldom fire people, I’d rather torture them to greatness.”

NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang's leadership philosophy on firing and performance



How NVIDIA’s work culture reflects Jensen Huang’s management style



Why Jensen Huang believes discomfort leads to growth



How employees and observers interpret the quote



What Jensen Huang’s quote really says about leadership







When NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang talks about leadership, he doesn’t reach for the usual corporate language. One of his more striking lines is,It sounds odd at first. A boss talking about “torture” rarely lands in polite conversation. But the meaning becomes clearer when you look at how Huang explains what he actually does with his teams. He doesn’t mean cruelty. He means pushing people to grow, learn, and reach a point they might not reach on their own. It’s a style of leadership rooted in belief rather than abandonment. Huang has said he prefers to help people improve instead of simply letting them go when things get tough. He frames this as a belief in potential, a view grounded in his own journey from humble beginnings to the helm of a global tech giant.This quote taps into a broader discussion happening in workplaces today about talent, resilience, and how leaders cultivate performance. Huang’s words are often described as tongue in cheek, yet they point to a real approach many executives wrestle with: should you cut losses and fire someone who’s struggling, or invest time and effort in helping them rise? In Huang’s view, that investment can pay off in unexpected ways.Huang has repeatedly said that firing is not his first instinct. He sees it as a last step, not an early one. In interviews, he has explained that when someone is underperforming, the more important question is why. Is the role wrong? Is the support missing? Is the feedback unclear? His response is usually to lean in, not step away.That approach has shaped NVIDIA’s internal culture. Expectations are high. Feedback is direct. People are expected to learn fast and adapt. Huang believes that struggling inside a demanding environment often teaches more than being comfortable in an easier one. His quote about “torture” reflects that belief. It is about sustained challenge, not humiliation or fear.He has also said that if he hires someone, it means he already believes in their potential. Walking away from that too easily would mean questioning his own judgment. So instead, he stays engaged and pushes for improvement.NVIDIA is widely known as a demanding place to work. Employees have described long hours, intense deadlines, and constant pressure to deliver. At the same time, many stay for years. Compensation, stock rewards, and the chance to work on cutting-edge technology all play a role.Huang’s leadership style is closely tied to that environment. He has said that meaningful work is rarely easy. Progress, especially in advanced computing and artificial intelligence, comes from sustained effort and repeated failure. Teams are expected to confront problems directly, not avoid them.This is where the quote often gets misunderstood. Huang is not celebrating burnout. He is describing a belief that growth happens under pressure, and that leaders should help people through that pressure instead of replacing them at the first sign of difficulty.Huang has spoken openly about discomfort being a teacher. He believes that moments of frustration often come right before breakthroughs. If leaders remove pressure too soon, they may also remove the chance for real learning.In his view, coaching is not about being gentle all the time. It is about being honest. That can mean telling someone their work is not good enough, then staying with them while they fix it. It can mean repeating feedback until it finally lands. That process is hard. For both sides.The phrase “torture them to greatness” sticks because it captures that tension. Growth is rarely smooth. It usually involves moments when quitting feels easier. Huang believes leaders should not make quitting the default option.Reactions to Huang’s words are mixed. Some admire the clarity. Others question whether this level of pressure works for everyone. That debate is common in tech, especially in companies growing as fast as NVIDIA has in recent years.What is clear is that Huang’s quote reflects how he actually operates. NVIDIA’s rise as a dominant force in AI and computing did not happen through cautious leadership. It came from aggressive goals, constant iteration, and teams pushed to deliver more than they thought possible.At its core, this quote is not about suffering. It is about commitment. Huang is saying that he would rather invest time, energy, and effort into developing people than discard them quickly. That choice comes with pressure, discomfort, and high expectations. But it also comes with trust.Not every leader works this way. Not every workplace should. But in Huang’s case, the words align closely with the results and the culture he has built. The quote stands out because it is unpolished, honest, and a little unsettling. Which is often how real leadership conversations sound when they are not filtered for comfort.","Jensen Huang, CEO of tech giant NVIDIA, said he would rather torture people than fire them.
