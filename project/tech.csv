According to the latest injury report, Morant is listed as ""Day-To-Day"" ahead of the February 2 matchup at Fiserv Forum.The Memphis Grizzlies , who currently hold a 32-16 record, have been managing multiple injuries, with Ja Morant joining Marcus Smart (finger), Cam Spencer (thumb), and Vince Williams Jr. (ankle) on the injury report. While the extent of Morant's shoulder issue remains unclear, the ""Day-To-Day"" designation suggests a short-term concern rather than a prolonged absence.This injury comes at a crucial point in the season as Memphis continues to push for a strong playoff position. Morant, known for his explosive scoring and playmaking, has been a key piece in the team’s success. Without him, the Grizzlies would rely more on Jaren Jackson Jr., Desmond Bane, and other role players to step up in the backcourt.Milwaukee, currently 26-20, is also dealing with injury concerns, with six players on the injury report, including Giannis Antetokounmpo (patella) and Damian Lillard (groin), though both are listed as probable. Meanwhile, the Grizzlies will need to monitor Ja Morant’s condition leading up to the game to determine if he can take the floor.If Morant is unable to play, Memphis will turn to Jaren Jackson Jr., who has been leading the team with 24.1 points per game over the last 20 contests. Desmond Bane has also been a reliable offensive weapon, averaging 20.3 points and 6.2 assists.Memphis leads the NBA in scoring with 123.2 points per game but will face a tough challenge against the Bucks, who have a strong defensive presence. The Memphis Grizzlies also hold a +7.5-point differential, showcasing their ability to dominate opponents.Ja Morant’s status remains uncertain, but the Grizzlies will be hoping for a quick recovery as they continue their push toward the postseason. With both teams dealing with injuries, this matchup could come down to depth and key performances from supporting players.

Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic. In his memoir, Spare, the Duke of Sussex talks about reaching out to a medium with supernatural abilities to communicate with Diana, who passed away in a car accident in Paris in 1997, just before his 13th birthday, The Mirror reported.The Duke received a message from his mother through the psychic, who told him, ""You're living the life she wanted for you."" Harry, now 40, says that the medium also told him his mother was with him ""right now,"" which made his neck warm and his eyes fill with tears.The psychic shared that Diana knew Harry was ""looking for clarity"" and ""feels your confusion."" She added that Diana understood Harry had ""so many questions"" and that answers would come in time.Another anecdote involved Prince Harry’s son, Archie. The psychic reportedly described how Diana’s spirit witnessed Archie accidentally breaking a Christmas tree ornament shaped like Queen Elizabeth. When asked, Harry admitted the incident had occurred, adding that Archie had attempted to fix the ornament.The medium suggested Diana found humour in the situation, delighting in the antics of her grandson she never had the chance to meet.In Spare, Prince Harry also recounts an extraordinary encounter with a leopard during a trip to Botswana with his brother, Prince William. He interpreted the animal’s presence as a comforting sign from his late mother, suggesting that ""everything will be fine."" However, the experience was not without fear, as he briefly worried the leopard might attack.Harry has been candid about the psychological toll of losing Diana so young. As reported by The Mirror, he disclosed a haunting period after her death when he entertained the possibility that she had staged her demise. His anguish led him to repeatedly drive through the Paris tunnel where Diana’s life was cut short, attempting to make sense of the tragedy.","Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic.

Dubai has been long celebrated as a global retail haven, and is now making waves in the world of artificial intelligence (AI). Known for its expansive malls and top-tier brands, the city is seamlessly blending tradition with technology to reshape how consumers shop, interact with brands, and experience retail.Behind the luxurious displays and bespoke offerings lies a layer of AI-powered innovation that’s redefining personalisation, streamlining operations, and enhancing customer satisfaction. From designing jewellery to curating personalised shopping experiences, Dubai is setting new benchmarks in the global retail landscape.In today’s retail environment, customers seek experiences that resonate on a personal level. AI has emerged as the linchpin of this transformation. Amreen Iqbal , Founder and Creative Director of Piece of You, a custom jewellery brand in Dubai, emphasises the depth of this shift: “It’s about understanding the customer deeper—what they want, how they want it, and how we can make it special and unique to each customer. AI helps us do that.”Her brand employs AI-powered tools to enable customers to design unique jewellery pieces through virtual try-ons and bespoke customisation. “The ability to personalise jewellery at this level was unthinkable a few years ago. Now, with AI, it’s a reality,” she adds.Similarly, global e-commerce innovations have gained traction in Dubai. Sue Azari , an e-commerce consultant at, notes, “AI enables highly customised and intuitive customer experiences.”She cites Zalando’s AI-powered chatbot as a perfect example: “If you need an outfit for a Christmas party, you simply describe your needs, and the chatbot curates a complete look, including accessories. It’s like having a personal shopper who knows your wardrobe.”In the beauty sector, major players like Sephora are redefining the customer journey with AI. Through augmented reality (AR) and AI features, their app enables users to virtually try on products like lipstick shades while integrating seamless social sharing options. Azari explains, “It’s about creating an experience, not just a transaction.”Walid BenOthman, Managing Director at Bitpanda, in Dubai, added that AI-driven personalisation has created a 25% improvement in customer satisfaction, revenue, or cost reduction. “Additionally, AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants provide 24/7 customer support, improving engagement and customer satisfaction.”He explained AI has made it easy to bring in hyper-personalised advertisements by analysing customer behaviour, creating more effective campaigns and higher conversion rates.Adding to Dubai’s retail innovation is the launch of theat Dubai Mall, as reported. The AI-powered store enhances the telecom retail experience by offering an array of cutting-edge features. Using AI and robotics, customers can explore products, make payments, and even collect purchases from automated lockers.The store is equipped with advanced facial recognition technology, enabling personalised interactions and tailored product suggestions. It epitomises Dubai’s vision to merge physical retail with AI-driven efficiency. As highlighted in several news reports, this initiative underscores Dubai’s commitment to revolutionising traditional retail through technology. report by GoGlobe has highlighted that Dubai AI’s impact extends beyond personalisation, revolutionising how brands market their products. Generative AI (genAI) has emerged as a game-changer, enabling dynamic, hyper-personalised advertisements and streamlining content creation.“AI doesn’t just generate content; it analyses performance metrics to refine strategies in real-time. It saves marketers countless hours and ensures campaigns are efficient and impactful,” explains Azari.Iqbal highlights AI’s ability to enhance marketing precision through predictive analytics, helping businesses target audiences with unparalleled accuracy. From creating dynamic ads to optimising email campaigns, AI ensures that every touchpoint is relevant and impactful.At Amazon, for instance, AI-generated product descriptions have not only increased efficiency but also improved SEO performance and consistency. “This is not just automation; it’s about making marketing smarter and more strategic,” notes Azari.While customers benefit from AI-driven personalisation, its operational applications are equally transformative. Gavin Jackson, Senior Vice President of Data and AI at Endava, highlights the role of AI in inventory management: “AI has turned inventory management into a science. Retailers can now accurately predict demand, ensuring shelves are stocked without over-ordering. It’s a win for both businesses and consumers.”Jackson explains that AI-powered systems can even trigger additional production when products start selling out, ensuring businesses never miss a sales opportunity. Logistics and supply chains are also undergoing an AI-driven revolution, with systems optimising delivery routes, warehouse layouts, and energy consumption. “It’s about creating an interconnected ecosystem where every touchpoint is as efficient as possible,” he adds.Dubai’s embrace of AI is propelling the city into a new era of retail excellence. By integrating advanced technologies across personalisation, marketing, and operations, the city is not only enhancing customer experiences but also setting a global standard for innovation in retail.As Iqbal aptly puts it, “The ability to create personalised, meaningful experiences isn’t just a luxury—it’s a necessity. And AI makes it possible.”Dubai’s commitment to leveraging AI ensures that its reputation as a global retail hub remains stronger than ever, firmly rooted in innovation and customer-centricity.","Dubai is blending tradition with technology to reshape how consumers shop, interact with brands, and experience retail.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

In 1999, Bill Gates , co-founder of Microsoft and one of the most influential technologists in history, authored a book titled. The book contained 15 bold predictions that at the time seemed almost too futuristic to come true. However, as the world has advanced over the past two decades, these predictions have not only materialised but have become integral to modern life.Bill Gates’ foresight, based on emerging technologies, offers a fascinating lens into how the digital revolution was shaping up, even before many of its most transformative tools existed, including cloud computing, e-commerce, and artificial intelligence.One of Gates' first predictions was the development of automated price-comparison tools. He foresaw a world where consumers could effortlessly compare prices across multiple websites to find the cheapest options for products and services. Today, this prediction is a reality with platforms like Google Shopping, PriceGrabber, and Honey, which streamline the shopping experience by providing price comparisons and discounts across industries.Gates envisioned small, portable devices that would enable constant connectivity, allowing people to check news, manage finances, and perform everyday tasks. This prediction perfectly describes today’s smartphones and tablets, which have become indispensable for modern communication, commerce, and information consumption. Devices like the iPhone, introduced in 2007, revolutionized how we interact with technology and turned Gates’ vision into a universal reality.According to Gates, people would manage their finances and communicate with doctors over the internet. Platforms such as PayPal, Venmo, and Google Pay have made instant online payments a standard part of life, while telemedicine apps like Teladoc and Practo allow patients to consult with doctors remotely. These innovations have not only simplified everyday life but have also democratized access to essential services.Another prediction involved ""personal companions"" that could sync all devices and help manage schedules, purchases, and data sharing. This concept is embodied in today’s digital assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. Integrated with the Internet of Things (IoT), these assistants control smart devices, streamline home management, and adapt to users’ needs, making daily routines more efficient.Gates anticipated the use of constant video feeds for home monitoring, a feature that has gained massive popularity through smart security systems like Ring and Nest. These systems allow homeowners to monitor their properties remotely, receive real-time alerts, and maintain peace of mind, showcasing how Gates’ vision has translated into practical solutions for home security.In 1999, Gates predicted private online spaces where friends and family could interact and plan events. Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp have taken this concept even further, enabling people worldwide to connect, share, and communicate in real time.Gates foresaw software capable of analyzing travel plans and providing personalized promotional offers, discounts, and activity suggestions. Today, platforms like Expedia and TripAdvisor do exactly that, using AI algorithms to tailor recommendations based on user preferences and travel history.Gates imagined services that would allow real-time discussions during live sports broadcasts. Platforms like Twitter and specialized apps like ESPN and Hotstar have made this a reality, enabling fans to engage, predict outcomes, and even interact with commentators during live events.The concept of personalized advertising, which Gates predicted, is now a cornerstone of modern marketing. Platforms like Google and Facebook use advanced algorithms and user data to deliver ads tailored to individual preferences, maximizing their relevance and impact.Gates predicted that TV broadcasts would include links to related online content. This is evident in today’s streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime, where viewers can access trailers, behind-the-scenes content, and even shop for items featured in their favorite shows.The prediction that the internet would host discussions on local and global issues has come true with platforms like Reddit, Quora, and city-specific forums. These sites provide spaces for users to share opinions and collaborate on topics ranging from local politics to global challenges.Gates foresaw online communities forming based on shared interests rather than geographical proximity. Platforms like LinkedIn, Pinterest, and niche forums have enabled people to connect with others who share their hobbies, passions, and professional goals.The idea of project managers finding skilled team members online has been realized through platforms like Trello, Asana, and Jira. These tools streamline team collaboration and project execution, making them essential for modern businesses.Gates predicted that job seekers would declare their skills and preferences online to find suitable employment. Platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed have turned this prediction into reality, revolutionizing how people search for and secure jobs.The final prediction envisioned companies bidding on projects or jobs through online platforms. Websites like Upwork and Freelancer have made this process seamless, connecting businesses with freelancers and specialized service providers to complete diverse projects efficiently.","In 1999, Bill Gates authored a book titled Business @ the Speed of Thought.

The artificial intelligence (AI) industry has seen rapid advancements in recent years, with companies from around the world competing to develop the most powerful and cost-effective models. A new entrant, DeepSeek, a Chinese AI application, has emerged as a significant competitor to established U.S. firms such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. DeepSeek has gained widespread attention for its claim that its R1 model was developed at a fraction of the cost of its competitors, prompting discussions about the future of AI and its global economic impact.The app has already made waves in the market, becoming the most downloaded free app in the United States within a week of its launch. Its success has even prompted political figures, including former U.S. President Donald Trump, to call it a “wake-up call” for the American technology sector. But how does DeepSeek compare to well-established AI platforms such as ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini? Here's a detailed look at DeepSeek’s capabilities across various domains, including writing assistance, coding, brainstorming, research, and content generation, positioning it as a formidable player in the AI landscape.One of the most common uses of AI models is content generation. ChatGPT has gained popularity for its ability to assist users with writing blog posts, summarizing information, and structuring ideas in a logical and well-organized manner.To compare their writing abilities, DeepSeek and ChatGPT were given a simple prompt:While both AI models performed well, ChatGPT’s response was more structured and comprehensive, whereas DeepSeek delivered a factual list with a brief description.Developers have increasingly relied on AI models to assist with debugging, generating code snippets, and problem-solving. Recently, when ChatGPT experienced an outage, many developers took to social media, expressing their dependence on AI-powered coding assistance.AI researcher Javier Aguirre from Samsung Medical Center in South Korea tested DeepSeek's ability to solve complex coding problems. According to his analysis:According to Addy Osmani, Head of Chrome Developer Experience at Google, DeepSeek is not only highly capable but also significantly cheaper compared to OpenAI’s latest models. This cost-effectiveness could make it an attractive alternative for companies and individual developers alike.Another key use of AI models is idea generation and creative writing. To test this, both DeepSeek and ChatGPT were given the prompt:While ChatGPT provided a variety of creative directions, DeepSeek’s approach was to generate a complete narrative instantly. This suggests that DeepSeek may be better suited for users looking for a full draft rather than brainstorming multiple concepts.AI models are frequently used for research and education, particularly for simplifying complex historical and scientific topics. A common challenge is explaining the causes of World War I, a topic often covered in school curricula.Overall, ChatGPT and Gemini provided more comprehensive research-based responses, whereas DeepSeek’s strength lies in delivering concise summaries.DeepSeek’s rapid rise has demonstrated that the U.S. AI companies no longer have a monopoly over the market. Its ability to perform tasks at a lower cost while maintaining competitive accuracy and efficiency raises questions about the future of AI development and global competition.Experts, including Professor Neil Lawrence from the University of Cambridge, believe that AI innovation is just beginning. He compared the current AI landscape to historical breakthroughs in engineering, noting that “there is plenty of space for budding James Watts to emerge,” referring to innovators who may refine and improve existing AI models rather than invent entirely new systems.","DeepSeek is the most widely used AI chatbot globally.

Pentagon, headquarters of the US Department of Defense has banned DeepSeek after its employees connected their work computers to Chinese servers to access the new Chinese AI chatbot. DeepSeek, which claims to have developed its AI model for less than $6 million, has gained attention for its low-cost approach. It briefly became the most downloaded app on Apple’s App Store, drawing praise from tech leaders like Marc Andreessen.DeepSeek's rapid rise has raised security concerns among US officials, leading the Pentagon to block access over data privacy risks.A report by Bloomberg says that some employees in the US Defense Department used their work computers to access DeepSeek for at least two days before the Pentagon blocked access. The Defense Information Systems Agency, responsible for the Pentagon’s IT networks, restricted access to DeepSeek’s website on Tuesday (January 28) after concerns were raised about its use. The report,quoting a defense official, said some Pentagon computers displayed a ""Website Blocked"" message on Wednesday (January 29), though others could still access the chatbot.Pentagon IT experts are investigating how employees accessed DeepSeek. Some military personnel downloaded an earlier version of its code in late 2024 without raising security concerns at the time, as its connection to China was not initially clear, the report stated. The latest release has led some military branches to review and remove AI tools linked to China from work computers.The US Navy has asked its members not to use DeepSeek’s AI due to security and ethical concerns about its origin and use. The Navy has reportedly sent an email, warning its team to avoid using DeepSeek’s AI, both for work and personal tasks. In the email, the Navy instructed its members not to download, install, or use DeepSeek’s AI at all.“We would like to bring to your attention a critical update regarding a new AI model called DeepSeek,” the email said.

Speed shares update after his Royal Rumble stint



The 2025 Men's Royal Rumble started with the two luchadores - Rey Mysterio and Penta. One after the other, wrestling stars started entering the ring, but one particular entry caught everyone by surprise, even the entrant himself. Triple H, the Chief Content Officer of WWE , had previously invited iShowSpeed through social media to cover the Royal Rumble event live. But everyone kept speculating if he would enter the squared circle, and well, guess we all have our answers nowThe Men's Royal Rumble saw multiple heavyweights entering the squared circle with only one goal in mind.

Olivia Holzmacher Breaks Silence After Joe Burrow Split



After a year of silence, Olivia Holzmacher, the ex-girlfriend of Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow , has finally broken her social media silence. Known for her long-term relationship with Burrow, Olivia, who is from Ohio, has been a notable presence in his life from college to the NFL. The couple reportedly began dating during their time at Ohio State University and remained together as Joe's career skyrocketed, with Olivia frequently appearing by his side during major events like the Heisman Trophy ceremony and the 2020 NFL Draft.In the past year, rumors of their breakup began circulating, especially when Olivia vanished from social media. Her last Instagram post was on January 31, 2024, over a year ago. Despite the rumors, Olivia has now taken to Instagram, sharing a series of photos along with an empowering message that reflects her personal growth. She posted, ""be intentional , do the hard $hit , && show, don’t tell. I found my deeper well."" This cryptic yet inspiring caption suggests that Olivia has been on a journey of self-discovery and strength following the end of her relationship with Burrow.In an unexpected twist, a December 2024 burglary at Joe Burrow’s Ohio home brought further attention to the situation. While the Bengals were away playing the Dallas Cowboys, it was revealed that model and influencer Olivia Ponton had been at Burrow’s house during the break-in and contacted the police. Later reports indicated that Joe Burrow and Olivia Ponton had been romantically involved for some time, which confirmed the end of his relationship with Holzmacher. Neither Burrow nor Ponton has publicly commented on the nature of their relationship.Joe Burrow later expressed his frustration with the lack of privacy that comes with being a public figure. ""I feel like my privacy has been violated in more ways than one, and way more is already out there than I would want out there and that I care to share,"" he said. “We live a public life. One of my least favorite parts of that is the lack of privacy, and that has been difficult for me to deal with my entire career.”Also Read: Taylor Swift lights up the 2025 Grammys in Chiefs red while her boyfriend Travis Kelce arrives in New Orleans in pursuit of historic Super Bowl three-peat As Olivia begins to share more of her life on social media, it signals that she may be in a better place emotionally.
