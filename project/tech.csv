The release of Meghan’s book could further inflame tensions between the Sussexes and the Royal Family , particularly following the mixed reception of Harry's memoir, Spare.Bower also criticized Meghan’s acting career, remarking, “The problem is, she isn’t a great actress. Her acting career ended long before she arrived in London - that’s why she came here. She couldn’t find any more work after Suits.”Speculation about Meghan’s autobiography has been circulating since Harry’s book gained attention in early 2023. Some publishing experts believe it is strategic for the couple to delay further releases, as maintaining public interest is crucial. An insider noted, “Fans are fickle. Disappoint them once, and a book can freefall into irrelevance super quickly, even with the momentum of something like Spare behind it. Their team, who are good at what they do, wants to make the angry mobs salivate for it before throwing Meghan’s story to the masses because even the bad press is good press for this couple.”","Royal expert Tom Bower has highlighted the lucrative possibilities of such a book, predicting it could significantly boost their income.

Hobby apps over dating apps? Why fitness and reading platforms are the new matchmakers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/hobby-apps-over-dating-apps-why-fitness-and-reading-platforms-are-the-new-matchmakers/articleshow/113214577.cms,"Strava sees significant growth

Hobby platforms turned social networks

Why the shift?

The changing landscape of social apps

Dating apps like Tinder and Bumble are no longer the go-to platforms for singles seeking love. Instead, people are now turning to Goodreads and Strava , apps initially designed for running, reading, and other hobbies, to find their perfect match.Strava, the popular fitness app known for tracking running and cycling activities, has experienced a substantial 20% increase in user numbers over the past year, according to Sensor Tower and reported by The Guardian.This surge in users has prompted Strava to introduce a new messaging feature, allowing users to connect while tracking their fitness goals.Other hobby-based apps are also seeing a boost in users. Ravelry, a social network for knitting enthusiasts, now boasts a user base of over 9 million. Goodreads, the platform for book lovers, has accumulated more than 150 million members. Meanwhile, Letterboxd , an app for movie enthusiasts, has seen its user base explode from 1.8 million in March 2020 to over 14 million this summer. The app’s impressive 55% growth in monthly active users highlights the increasing popularity of these niche social networks.Dr Carolina Are, a social media researcher at the Centre for Digital Citizens at Northumbria University, explains that these hobby-based apps allow users to connect through shared interests, creating a more engaging and less contentious environment. This focus on common passions reduces the need for stringent content moderation and enhances the overall user experience.Letterboxd’s editor-in-chief, Gemma Gracewood, adds that the app’s design, which includes in-line comments and a community-focused approach, discourages public shaming and amplifies the positive interactions among users. Similarly, Goodreads and Strava offer messaging features that foster connections without the risk of public shaming prevalent on other platforms.As users increasingly migrate from traditional social networks and dating apps, new platforms are emerging as havens for genuine connections. With many abandoning Elon Musk’s social network due to controversies over free speech, apps like Bluesky and Threads are seeing a resurgence, while hobby-based platforms continue to thrive.Are suggests that the lower expectations and less sexually charged atmosphere on these hobby apps create a more relaxed environment for users seeking meaningful connections. Unlike traditional dating apps, which can often feel like a “dating supermarket,” these platforms offer a refreshing alternative for those looking to find love through shared interests.","Strava, the popular fitness app known for tracking running and cycling activities, has experienced a substantial 20% increase in user numbers over the past year.

Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Speaking on the ""Acquired"" podcast, Zuckerberg emphasised the stark differences in company cultures and approaches to product development.""I think in a lot of ways we're like the opposite of Apple,"" Zuckerberg stated, contrasting Meta's rapid product release strategy with Apple's more deliberate approach.He argued that Meta's willingness to ship products quickly, even at the risk of initial imperfection, fosters faster learning and improvement.Zuckerberg criticised Apple's meticulous product development cycle, saying, ""If you want to wait until you get praised all the time, you're missing a bunch of the time when you could've learned a bunch of useful stuff and then incorporated that into the next version you're going to ship.""The rivalry extends beyond product competition, encompassing fundamental ideological differences about the future of technology. Zuckerberg advocates for open platforms, stating his goal ""to build the next generation of open platforms and have the open platforms win."" This stance directly opposes Apple's tightly controlled ecosystem.""I think it's in some ways very deeply values-driven and ideological competition around what the future of the tech industry should be,"" Zuckerberg explained, highlighting areas of competition including AI , augmented reality glasses, and developer platforms.While Apple CEO Tim Cook has previously downplayed the rivalry, recent developments suggest intensifying competition.

The platform is introducing a new feature that allows creators to break their videos into seasons and episodes, similar to the format used by Netflix and other streaming services.This new formatting will make it easier for viewers to navigate and find specific content within a channel.It's a significant step for YouTube as it continues to expand its presence in the living room, where YouTuber revenue on TVs has increased by 30% year over year.Although YouTube hasn't provided details on how the new formatting will appear on desktop and mobile devices, it's expected to be available across all platforms. In addition to the season and episode feature, creators will also have access to other TV-focused tools, such as the ability to add immersive content that plays directly on their channel page.Previously, some YouTubers had created seasons and episodes for their shows by using playlists and numbered naming conventions. However, this method often resulted in a less user-friendly experience on TV platforms like Apple TV and Roku.

Ken Shamrock Reveals Why He Declined the WWE Brawl for All Tournament,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/ken-shamrock-reveals-why-he-declined-the-wwe-brawl-for-all-tournament/articleshow/113498837.cms,"“I am not persuaded by insults and by ridicule”: Ken Shamrock defends his stance

Ken Shamrock & Dan Severn - Brawl for All Debacle in WWF

“I was asked, I said No. Listen, I got paid big money, big, big money to fight [in the UFC]. So now they're asking me to do this thing for free? Listen, I think anybody that has been involved in pro wrestling understands how hard it is to gain trust in the locker room. If guys don’t trust you, they’re not going to work for you. They’re not going to allow you to do things that they feel they may get hurt with. So that was one of the things that Bret really instilled in me was being able to make sure that I had a relationship with the locker room. I would go up and say hi to people, shake their hand, be open to suggestions, building relationships, because you got to build trust.” (Via Chris Van Vliet/Inside the Ropes)

“These guys got to trust me to go in the ring with them, and then they asked me to fight. I’m like, so now I’m going to go in there and beat the hell out of these guys and then go back and say, Hey, we’re going to do a pro wrestling match. I just felt like that was kind of going against the grain of what I was trying to do there. I guess they were paying, I don’t know how much it was, 50 grand or something if you won it? You guys asked me to come here and do a certain thing, and we negotiated a contract for that, and now you want me to actually fight? So I’m doing two things now, and I just felt like, Yeah, this is not for me.” (Via Chris Van Vliet/Inside the Ropes)

“I am not persuaded by insults and by ridicule, people saying ‘You’re afraid to go against the pro wrestlers and you’re afraid to get in there, you’re afraid of this guy, you’re afraid of that guy…’ That does nothing. You’re not going to shame me into trying to fight somebody. I mean, if I’m going to fight them, I’m gonna fight them, and we’re gonna negotiate something, and we’ll do it. But I’m not gonna be shamed into fighting.

It just felt like that’s what was trying to happen, not WWF, just the fan base, because they were pro wrestlers and they’re pro wrestling fans, and by me saying, No, I didn’t want to do that. I’m not going to do that. There was that whole scene behind the scenes where people were saying, Yeah, the Shamrock is afraid. I’m thinking to myself wow, how soon people forget.”

American retired professional wrestler and mixed martial artist , Ken Shamrock has been a key figure in both UFC and WWE . He also pioneered the “shoot style of wrestling”, making it popular in the American circuits, among his other unique maneuvers during a fight. Such was his undeniable persona that he was nicknamed “The World's Most Dangerous Man”. In a recent interview, Shamrock has commented on his reluctance to be a part of the Brawl for All tournament.The tournament in question, Brawl for All, was designed by Vince Russo to screen out the toughest man from their current roster. While the fight itself would be ruthless, with many able wrestlers ending up being grievously injured, still it continued to be a popular event among the fighters. Of these “tough guys”, the unarguably capable contenders were Dan Severn and Ken Shamrock. Dan Severn took part in the fight, successfully gaining victory over The Godfather, but he did not remain in the following matches. Shamrock was offered to fight a similar match, but he refused to be a part of it.In a candid interview with Chris Van Vliet, Ken finally opened up about why he had declined the offer to be a part of the Brawl For All contest. Shamrock said:Stressing the importance of having a healthy relationship with his fellow wrestlers from the locker- room who he would further go on to fight against in pro wrestling, Shamrock stated,Shamrock stood his ground when people blamed him for not taking part in the brawl, defending his stance by further adding,Shamrock in the true spirit of a fighter and a team- player showed what it means to be successful but at the same time, choosing which battles to fight and which ones to drop.Also read: WWE Registers Trademarks For Two New Superstar names","Retired professional wrestler and mixed martial artist Ken Shamrock has commented on his reluctance to be a part of the Brawl for All tournament.

WWE NXT star Giulia’s life has completely turned around ever since she made her debut for the developmental brand at NXT No Mercy. Since then, Giulia has defeated main roster talent Chelsea Green and is currently the #1 contender for Roxanne Perez ’s NXT Women’s Championship . On the latest episode of NXT, CM Punk took the stage to make a special announcement that was cut short by Perez.Roxanne made her way to the ring, and after she was done exchanging a few insults with CM Punk, Giulia walked out. The newcomer approached the champ and told her that her time with the title is coming to an end. Perez tried to attack Giulia while she was leaving, but CM Punk intervened and prevented a brawl in the ring.After the episode, Giulia met Punk backstage and the two clicked a picture. Giulia shared this picture on her Instagram account and let everyone know how honored she was to be sharing the ring with CM Punk, of all people. Punk even replied to Giulia’s post to let her know that the honor was all his, which is the highest complement one can receive at such an early stage in their career.

While this may sound far-fetched, there is some logic behind it.Perez has been ready for the main roster for quite some time now, but since she is the NXT Women’s Champion, she can’t move up. Now that Giulia is here, it presents the perfect opportunity for Perez to drop her title and move up in the wrestling world. However, whether this comes to pass or not will all depend on Giulia’s ability to be a legit contender and leader for the women in NXT.

“But I’ve been there when he’s done good things. I’ve seen him do good things. I know I wanted, when I was writing books, I wanted to essentially do something like ‘Chicken Soup For The Wrestling Fan’s Soul’ about some of these heartwarming moments. And he was like, ‘Ugh, Mick, I’m afraid that would come across as self-serving.’ So, he was someone who did the right thing for the right reasons a lot of the time.

“I feel really bad that someone I care about got into something that seems pretty unsavory. I’m gonna hold off judgment until I see the [docuseries], but I think one thing that’s fortunate is, whatever he did or did not do, I don’t think many of us are allowing that to mess with our memories. He was instrumental in creating some of those memories, so I’m choosing to appreciate him until I learn more about what may have gone down.”

Triple H vs. Rikishi — WWE Championship Match: SmackDown, January 6, 2000

“As far as with the Netflix (docuseries), I’ll make a decision when that comes out. But for now, I always believe in people having a second chance in life. There is nobody in this arena or up here that were perfect. We’re never perfect. It’s not made like that in this world for us. There’s always speed bumps for us, to be able to learn from one another. Each one, teach one. And so, at the end of the day, I would, like Mick, I would like to keep my happy memories of the McMahons.”

At this month's Comic Con Northern Ireland, WWE Hall of Famers Mick Foley and Rikishi were asked about their personal experiences with Vince McMahon in light of the upcoming Netflix docuseries on the former WWE CEO's controversies.Foley was the first to address the topic, sharing: “I genuinely liked him. My relationship was never the same with him after I left WWE and went to TNA for three years.But to this day, I’m still trying to find an address to write to him, just to thank him for taking a chance on me. I think all of us are a combination of good traits and bad traits, and you hope your good traits outweigh your bad traits, and it seems perhaps that Vince got it backwards there for a little while.Also read: ""I Heard The Entire Show Just Got Ripped In Half"": WWE Superstar Reflects On His Frustrations With Last-Minute Script Changes During Vince McMahon's Tenure Rikishi shared similar feelings and expressed his appreciation for the McMahon family, noting their longstanding relationship with the Fatu and Anoaʻi families and High Chief Peter Maivia that spans over 75 years, dating back to Vince McMahon’s father. He thanked the McMahons for providing opportunities for Samoan wrestlers to succeed and showcase their culture. Regarding Vince McMahon, Rikishi said:For Foley and Rikishi, reconciling their personal experiences with McMahon against the backdrop of the serious allegations is challenging. As Rikishi pointed out, learning from each other is essential. The scandal underscores how individual actions can impact many lives, with the most significant effects on the alleged victims.

'I think it's bad for the defenses': Seahawks' DK Metcalf Predicts an Offensive Explosion on the Horizon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/i-think-its-bad-for-the-defenses-seahawks-dk-metcalf-predicts-an-offensive-explosion-on-the-horizon/articleshow/113497430.cms,"Seahawks' DK Metcalf Thinks Opponents Should Fear



Their Depth Is Amazing



As the Seattle Seahawks continue their winning streak, wide receiver DK Metcalf is sending a chilling message to opposing defenses: watch out. The dynamic playmaker believes that the team's offensive firepower is on the brink of a full-scale detonation.Also Read: Fangio’s Defensive Decisions Criticized After Eagles Fall to Falcons A major indicator of this expectation is Jaxon Smith-Njigba, the Seahawks’ 2023 first-round pick, who recently showcased his talents with a 100-yard performance and 12 receptions in an overtime win against the New England Patriots.Smith-Njigba’s breakout performance has injected life into the Seattle offense, which has been led by quarterback Geno Smith. However, Metcalf, always one to look ahead, believes this is just the beginning for their offensive lineup.""I think it's bad for the defenses that try to cover us from here on out."" His belief that the offense is poised to become a ""ticking timebomb"" underscores the depth and potential of Seattle’s skill players. Along with Smith-Njigba, Metcalf mentioned veteran receiver Tyler Lockett , tight end Noah Fant, and running backs Kenneth Walker III and Zach Charbonnet as key players who have yet to hit their full stride.The Seahawks’ depth is truly remarkable. Despite some injuries, including Walker’s oblique injury and Fant’s ongoing recovery, Metcalf feels the offensive unit is on the verge of a breakthrough. Walker had already shown flashes of brilliance in Week 1, and Metcalf suggested that Charbonnet is another player waiting to make his mark. With so many offensive weapons, Metcalf's optimism is hard to dismiss.Metcalf's thoughts on Geno Smith also offer a glimpse into the quarterback's leadership. Smith, who has been labeled “underrated” by many, doesn't need to prove his worth, according to Metcalf. “He’s an NFL quarterback, just like 31 others,” Metcalf said, dismissing the notion that Smith is underappreciated. “He’s a great leader at quarterback and great at what he does at the quarterback position.”As the Seahawks prepare for their next challenge, Metcalf’s confidence in his teammates and belief in the offense’s potential to dominate will certainly be something to watch. While it remains to be seen whether the offensive explosion happens as soon as Week 3, it’s clear that Seattle’s offense is just getting started.Also Read: What are the new Guardian Caps in the NFL and are they safe to wear while playing?",Seattle Seahawks wide receiver DK Metcalf believes the team's offensive firepower is on the brink of a full-scale detonation.
