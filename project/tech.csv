Golden State Warriors vs Houston Rockets Game 6 overview

Thewill have Stephen Curry available for tonight’s high-stakes Game 7 against the Houston Rockets, despite the superstar guard continuing to play through a right thumb injury.Stephen Curry, who has been wearing a splint to protect the thumb, remains on the injury report but is fully cleared to play. His status hasn’t changed since Game 6, signaling that the issue isn’t severe enough to limit him in the winner-take-all matchup. Teammate Gary Payton II is also available despite dealing with a left thumb splint.The Warriors, who once led the series 3-1, now face immense pressure to avoid a historic collapse reminiscent of their 2016 Finals loss. Stephen Curry’s health is critical as Golden State leans on his championship experience to counter Houston’s surging momentum. The Rockets forced Game 7 after a dominant Game 6 win, fueled by Fred VanVleet’s offense and Steven Adams’ impact off the bench.Houston remains without Jock Landale (right knee contusion) and Jae’Sean Tate (right ankle impingement), though neither was expected to play major postseason minutes. Meanwhile, Warriors forward Jimmy Butler, previously listed with a pelvic contusion, has been removed from the injury report entirely.Tip-off is set for 7:30 p.m. CT, with the winner advancing to face the Minnesota Timberwolves in the second round. All eyes will be on Stephen Curry to see if his thumb—and his shooting—hold up under playoff pressure.The Houston Rockets defeated the Golden State Warriors 115-107 in Game 6 of their playoff series at the Chase Center, forcing a decisive Game 7. Fred VanVleet led the Rockets with 29 points, 8 rebounds, and 8 assists, shooting 6 of 9 from three-point range and a perfect 9-for-9 from the free-throw line. The Rockets exploited Golden State’s weakness inside by using a double-big lineup with centers Alperen Şengün and Steven Adams, which overwhelmed the Warriors' lack of interior presence.Also read: Jonathan Kuminga’s status for Game 7: Will the Golden State Warriors star play tonight against the Houston Rocket?

Ben Roethlisberger claims Aaron Rodgers is snubbing the Steelers while secretly waiting for a Vikings reunion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/ben-roethlisberger-claims-aaron-rodgers-is-snubbing-the-steelers-while-secretly-waiting-for-a-vikings-reunion/articleshow/120850426.cms,"Ben Roethlisberger suggests Aaron Rodgers might prefer Minnesota over Pittsburgh (Imagn Images)

Ben Roethlisberger suggests Aaron Rodgers might be eyeing Minnesota instead of Pittsburgh

A Vikings move would echo Brett Favre’s final NFL chapter

The NFL offseason is often filled with speculation, but Aaron Rodgers’ prolonged free agency has taken center stage. Despite being one of the most decorated quarterbacks of his generation, the 4-time MVP has yet to commit to a new team after parting ways with the New York Jets. And now, former Steelers legend Ben Roethlisberger has added an intriguing twist to the saga.Aaron Rodgers has been linked heavily with the Pittsburgh Steelers, who still have a major gap at quarterback. With Mason Rudolph, rookie Will Howard, and Skylar Thompson filling the depth chart, there’s a clear opportunity for Rodgers to take over under center. But despite sightings of Rodgers working out with new Steelers addition DK Metcalf, no deal has materialized.Ben Roethlisberger addressed the situation on his podcast, Footbahlin with Ben Roethlisberger, saying: “I think Aaron secretly, again, just my opinion, I think Aaron is secretly still holding out for Minnesota, which is why he hasn’t signed with the Steelers.”Roethlisberger further added, “Why else would you go throw to DK and be working out, and put it out blast to everybody that I’m throwing to these guys, but you won’t sign?”The Minnesota Vikings could offer Aaron Rodgers a smoother fit. Their quarterback-friendly offense under Kevin O’Connell and elite weapons like Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison make them a compelling destination. Rodgers is also no stranger to the NFC North, having battled the Vikings for years as a Packer.This potential move would mirror the path taken by Rodgers’ mentor Brett Favre, who left the Packers for the Jets before ultimately joining the Vikings. Earlier this offseason, Favre even voiced his hope that Rodgers would follow a similar trajectory.Are the Vikings even interested? That’s the biggest unknown. The Vikings already invested in young talent like J.J. McCarthy, Sam Howell, and undrafted rookie Max Brosmer. McCarthy is reportedly ready to lead, which may close the door on Rodgers in Minnesota.Also Read: “Sue the NFL for racial discrimination”: Deion Sanders pressured to to sue NFL for $40 million over Shedeur Sanders’ shocking draft fall With limited options remaining, the Pittsburgh Steelers might be Rodgers' most realistic destination. But if Roethlisberger’s theory holds water, Rodgers may still be waiting for a call that’s unlikely to come — one from the Vikings.Until then, the saga continues.","Ben Roethlisberger suggests Aaron Rodgers might be eyeing Minnesota instead of Pittsburgh.

How to play NYT Connections



Don't analyse the connections too deeply.

The game tends to employ simple links such as sounding similar, similar spellings, or common themes.

Example: ""dear"" and ""deer"" tend to be linked by sound, not by some elaborate relationship such as predator and prey.

You have only four guesses per puzzle per day, so every guess matters.

Don't mindlessly click—consider each set carefully before submitting.

Try to come up with at least three connected words confidently before trying a set.

The initial organization is deliberately mischievous to mislead you.

Shuffling the words may allow you to see new patterns or concealed connections.

Shuffle it as a routine to begin and whenever you are stuck.

“Mommy loves and misses you”: Vanessa Bryant’s heartfelt tribute to Gianna Bryant on what would have been her 19th birthday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/mommy-loves-and-misses-you-vanessa-bryants-heartfelt-tribute-to-gianna-bryant-on-what-would-have-been-her-19th-birthday/articleshow/120802366.cms,"Images via Getty Images

Remembering Gianna Bryant: A tribute to her legacy amid defaced murals and tough times



On Thursday, May 1, 2025, Vanessa Bryant marked what would have been her daughter Gianna “Gigi” Bryant’s 19th birthday with a touching Instagram post that resonated far beyond social media. Accompanied by a powerful image of Gigi in her basketball uniform, the post was a raw and emotional tribute from a mother who continues to carry the weight of an unimaginable loss. The moment was made even more emotional as it came just days after a beloved mural of Gigi and her father, Kobe Bryant, was vandalized in Los Angeles.From Los Angeles to global basketball circles, the name Gianna Bryant , known affectionately as “Gigi” and “Mambacita,” still echoes with deep meaning. On Thursday morning, Vanessa Bryant shared a birthday message on Instagram that read, “Happy birthday, Gigi! Mommy loves and misses you more than I could ever express. I love you Gianna. ❤️19 ♉️ 5/1 #Mambacita.” It was a simple yet deeply moving tribute that quickly garnered love and support from fans, athletes, and brands across the sports world.Gigi, the daughter of NBA legend Kobe Bryant , was just 13 when she and her father tragically died in a helicopter crash on January 26, 2020, along with seven others.Nicknamed “Mambacita,” Gigi was seen as the heir to Kobe’s legacy. He even trademarked the name for her in December 2019, recognizing her growing talent and fierce passion for basketball. She embodied the same Mamba Mentality that her father was known for—relentless, fearless, and unapologetically determined with a drive well beyond her age.Over the years, more than 330 murals have popped up across California honoring Kobe and Gigi. But just days before Gigi’s birthday, one of the most beloved murals in L.A., a portrait of the father and daughter, was defaced with black paint. The timing hit hard. It rattled fans and added even more emotional weight to a week that was already tough for Vanessa, who also has a birthday coming up on May 5. Moments like these are a painful reminder that grief doesn’t follow a calendar; it lingers quietly, then roars back without warning, especially on days meant to celebrate.To honor Gigi, Nike released a special edition “Mambacita” Kobe 9 sneaker on May 1, designed in partnership with the Bryant family. Inspired by Gigi’s drive and spirit, the shoe represents her commitment to excellence and her dream to elevate girls’ sports.Through the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation, Vanessa continues to champion those values, investing in youth athletics and pushing for gender equality in sports.Also Read: ‘Kobe' Chant: How a comedic skit sparked a global tradition and a classroom tribute that moved Vanessa Bryant May 1 will always be more than just a date for Vanessa Bryant; it’s a reminder of her daughter’s spirit, her dreams, and the powerful impact she left behind. With every post, every mural, and every new initiative, Gigi’s legacy continues to shine through, carried forward by a mother’s enduring love and a community that will never forget.","Vanessa Bryant marked what would have been her daughter Gianna “Gigi” Bryant’s 19th birthday with a touching Instagram post.

What is WWE's opinion regarding a Total Divas reboot?



There is no Total Divas reboot in the works. The ‘AmberLeila’ or ‘ANX’ account on Twitter is a complete fraud. Please do not send us their posts as news tips.""

“It was great to document us in the early days. Now, it would be incredible to see the new generation at the start of their careers.”

“I really, honestly, think… I get asked about it all the time. I really think there is something about all of us getting rebooted. Our OG crew with maybe two new ones. Us three, Nattie, Paige, and Nia. We’re all still working, then we bring in two new ones. So much has happened. It’s like the ‘Sex and The City’ reboot, ‘And Just Like That.’ We could have our Total Divas And Just Like That moment.”

Former Total Divas stars, Nikki Bella and Naomi push for the show's comeback, but it seems that WWE is not onboard with the idea.WWE experienced the start of the Women's Revolution in the mid-2010s. However, before that happened, a top reality series featuring the female WWE superstars was taking over reality TV. The show was known as Total Divas and showcased the lives of superstars inside and outside the squared circle. The show went off the air on December 10, 2019. However, Nikki Bella and Naomi, who were a part of the starcast, expressed interest in having the show back, but there has been an update that WWE is not interested.A wave of speculations began on social media regarding the return of Total Divas to television. However, a report by Fightful Select stated, ""Despite the rumors of being shut down, former cast members Naomi and Nikki Bella expressed their desire to see the show's return. In a recent interview with Casual Conversations, the GLOW pitched a different idea if the show makes its return while reflecting back on her time. She said,On an edition of the Nikki and Brie Show, Nikki Bella revealed that she had been asked about the return of Total Divas all the time and was onboard for a reboot of the show. The Fearless One said,While WWE reportedly has no plans to bring Total Divas back anytime soon, it will be interesting to see if they will change their opinion in the future.Also read: WWE releases spark debate over cost-cutting, creative direction and roster size","WWE is not interested in a Total Divas reboot, according to a report.

TOI Correspondent from London:

Over the years, patrons of Britain’s oldest Indian restaurant, ‘Veeraswamy’, have included Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Charlie Chaplin, Winston Churchill, Marlon Brando, Sharon Stone and David Cameron.A haunt of Indian maharajas and European royalty too, the King of Denmark even shipped out a cask of Carlsberg for staff to store for whenever he dined there.Now the Michelin-starred restaurant , which opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London, and today serves pineapple curry and chicken makhana au vin, is at threat of closure as the Crown Estate (property portfolio owned by King Charles), which owns Victory House, the building in which the restaurant is based, is refusing to renew its lease, which expires in June.The Crown Estate claims it needs to take the restaurant space back to extend the ground floor reception for offices on the building’s upper floors. Knocking through into Veeraswamy would give it an extra 11 sq mts.Veeraswamy’s founder, Edward Palmer, was the great-grandson of General William Palmer, and his wife, Begum Faiz Baksh, a Mughal princess. Gen Palmer was private secretary to Warren Hastings, first governor-general of the Presidency of Fort William. It was acquired by Ranjit Mathrani and Namita Panjabi in 1996.“Had they wanted to, they could’ve easily put the office reception on the first floor. I think they’ve come to the view that it’s too tiresome having a restaurant there, they want it to be all offices,” Mathrani (81), told the Times of London.If the Crown Estate refuses to allow the restaurant to stay put until he finds and fit out an alternative space, with its iconic décor inspired by the art nouveau of the 1920s and maharaja’s palaces, the restaurant will have to close, leading to possible redundancies and loss of business until a new site is found.Mathrani is taking the Crown Estate to court.A spokesperson for The Crown Estate told TOI: “The Crown Estate has a duty to generate value for the nation, while acting as responsible stewards for this historic part of London. We need to carry out a comprehensive refurbishment of Victory House. This includes a major upgrade to the offices and improving the entrance to make it more accessible. Due to the limited options available in this listed building we need to remove the entrance to the restaurant, which means we will not be able to offer Veeraswamy an extension when their lease expires.”","Michelin-starred restaurant Veeraswamy opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Apple’s App Store policies and their impact on Facebook

""When people started using mobile more, Apple told us, ‘You can’t have apps inside your app.’ That hurt something that had grown to be an important part of our business.""

Apple’s privacy and tracking policies

The bitter relationship between Meta and Apple

Apple’s legal challenges and the future of mobile platforms

The digital landscape has been shaped by a series of key players over the years, with Facebook, now Meta, standing at the forefront of the social media revolution. But for all its growth and transformation, the platform has faced significant challenges along the way. One of the more notable struggles came when Facebook 's thriving app and game ecosystem, including the wildly popular FarmVille , saw a dramatic decline.In a recent interview with tech writer Ben Thompson from Stratechery, Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg addressed a critical factor in this decline: Apple ’s strict App Store policies. Zuckerberg explained how Apple’s decisions over the years impacted Facebook’s ability to maintain its business model, particularly its app-based games, and how this shift altered the company’s trajectory in the mobile era.In the late 2000s, Facebook was at the peak of its desktop-based platform, where games and apps played a significant role in the platform's growth. The social network quickly became a hub for developers looking to create interactive content that would engage its growing user base. Games like FarmVille, Mafia Wars, and Texas HoldEm Poker captured the attention of millions, providing Facebook with a fresh revenue stream. By 2012, these apps contributed to about 20% of the company’s revenue, marking a high point for Facebook’s game platform.This success was primarily driven by Facebook’s ability to integrate its game platform into the broader Facebook experience, allowing users to discover and share apps with their friends. The platform was tailored for the web, and developers used Facebook’s social features to create viral games. As the desktop experience dominated, it seemed that Facebook’s app ecosystem would only continue to thrive.However, the rise of smartphones and mobile apps introduced a massive shift in the way people engaged with the internet. The advent of the iPhone and other smartphones ushered in a new era of app-based experiences that would change the way users interacted with social media and online games. As mobile platforms began to dominate, Zuckerberg and his team recognized that Facebook’s future would depend on successfully adapting to the mobile revolution.Unfortunately, Facebook’s smooth transition from desktop to mobile wasn't as seamless as they hoped. Zuckerberg recalled,The company’s model, which relied heavily on web-based interactions, needed to be overhauled to thrive in an app-centric mobile environment.It was at this point that Zuckerberg pointed to Apple’s App Store policies as a significant hurdle for Facebook's continued success in the mobile space. Facebook had initially planned to leverage its own app platform inside the iPhone to continue growing its mobile app and game ecosystem. However, Apple’s stringent rules soon made this impossible.In the early days of mobile app development, Apple implemented rules that severely restricted how companies like Facebook could operate within the App Store. One of the key policies that Zuckerberg highlighted was Apple’s decision to block Facebook from running its own app platform inside the iPhone. Zuckerberg explained,This policy change effectively cut Facebook off from the ability to operate a platform that could support games and apps in the same way it had on desktop. As a result, Facebook's ability to host third-party applications, which had been a core part of its business model, was significantly diminished. While Apple argued that these policies were necessary for maintaining the security and quality of apps on its platform, the restriction ultimately stifled the growth of Facebook’s app-based ecosystem.The ramifications were immediate and profound: Facebook’s once-booming app and game business started to decline, and developers who had once relied on Facebook’s platform for distribution were forced to adapt to the new constraints. Zuckerberg noted that by limiting Facebook’s access to key tools and changing the company’s relationship with developers, Apple set off a chain of events that led to the decline of its game and app platform.In addition to the restrictions on Facebook’s app platform, Zuckerberg also pointed to Apple’s privacy policies as a factor that further undermined Facebook’s mobile business. Specifically, Apple’s introduction of App Tracking Transparency (ATT) in 2020 made it more difficult for companies like Facebook to track user behavior across different apps and websites. This update, which required apps to ask users for permission before collecting data for targeted advertising, was seen as a direct challenge to Facebook’s ad-driven revenue model.For Facebook, which had built its business around precise ad targeting, this policy change was a blow to its ability to effectively monetize its platform. Zuckerberg expressed frustration with Apple’s stance, noting that its policies had placed significant limitations on how Facebook could operate in the mobile space.Zuckerberg’s comments on Apple reveal a deeper sense of frustration and bitterness between the two tech giants. He described Apple’s decisions as creating ""deep bitterness"" and emphasized the company’s refusal to consider the value Facebook’s platform could bring to the iPhone ecosystem. Zuckerberg argued that Apple’s approach was too restrictive and that it limited the potential for collaboration between the two companies.He expressed his belief that mobile platforms should be more open, similar to traditional desktop systems such as Windows or macOS, where developers have more freedom to build their own ecosystems and offer a wider range of services. Zuckerberg lamented that Apple’s ""walled garden"" approach prevented Facebook from fully realizing its potential in the mobile era.Zuckerberg’s comments come at a time when Apple is facing increasing legal scrutiny over its App Store policies. Recently, a U.S. judge ruled that Apple had violated an earlier order by continuing to block developers from linking users to external payment options. This ruling is part of a broader legal battle in which Apple is being accused of maintaining an illegal monopoly over the app market. Apple is also facing an antitrust lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice, which claims that the company’s practices harm competition in the smartphone industry.For Zuckerberg and Meta, these developments offer a glimmer of hope that Apple’s ""walled garden"" may eventually start to open up, allowing for greater freedom for developers and a more open mobile platform. As regulators push back against Apple’s control over the App Store, Zuckerberg and other tech leaders may see this as an opportunity for a more balanced and competitive mobile ecosystem.","Zuckerberg explains how Apple's App Store restrictions impacted Facebook’s mobile growth.

Mark Zuckerberg: Don’t judge AI in social roles too soon

“One of the main things we see people using

“Like ‘I’m having this issue with my girlfriend. Help me have this conversation.’ Or ‘How do I talk to my boss about a problem at work?’”

“The average person has demand for meaningfully more. I think it's something like 15 friends or something,”

“But at some point you're like, ‘All right, I’m just too busy, I can't deal with more people.’”

Mark Zuckerberg: AI won’t replace real-world connections

“There’s a lot of concern people raise like, ‘Is this going to replace real-world, physical, in-person connections?’ And my default is that the answer to that is probably not,”

The future of social AI at Meta

In an era where technology increasingly mediates our communication, the nature of human relationships is evolving at an unprecedented pace. At the forefront of this transformation is Mark Zuckerberg , the founder and CEO of Meta Platforms, whose innovations have fundamentally reshaped the way billions of people interact globally. From Facebook’s original mission to connect college students to today’s expansive virtual and AI-driven platforms, Zuckerberg has played a pivotal role in defining digital relationships.In a recent podcast interview hosted by Indian-American technology commentator Dwarkesh Patel , 23, Zuckerberg addressed a critical and timely question: Can artificial intelligence replace human relationships? Their in-depth conversation explored not only the psychological implications of AI companionship but also the growing trend of individuals turning to AI for emotional support, guidance, and even friendship. As AI continues to develop sophisticated conversational capabilities, this question carries far-reaching consequences for how we perceive intimacy, trust, and social fulfillment in the digital age.Artificial intelligence has rapidly become integrated into everyday digital platforms. Whether it's through chatbots, personal assistants, or generative AI tools, many users now interact with AI for more than just technical support. From role-playing therapy bots to AI friends offering emotional comfort, the scope of these interactions is broadening.Platforms such as Replika, Character.ai, and Meta’s own AI features are examples of how conversational AI is moving into domains previously reserved for human connection. This shift has prompted intense debate among technologists, psychologists, and ethicists: can machines simulate companionship, and should they?It was against this backdrop that Dwarkesh Patel asked Zuckerberg how AI developers can ensure users form healthy relationships with their artificial companions.Mark Zuckerberg emphasized the importance of understanding user behavior before making definitive judgments about AI’s role in social relationships. He noted that AI’s utility in helping people navigate emotional or difficult conversations is already evident.Zuckerberg said.This example suggests that rather than replacing human relationships, AI is currently being used as a tool to support and enhance them. Zuckerberg argued that being overly prescriptive about what AI should or should not do at this early stage might hinder valuable developments.A compelling point raised by Zuckerberg relates to the unmet social needs of many individuals. He cited a statistic from his experience working in social media that the average American has fewer than three people they would consider close friends.Zuckerberg stated.This discrepancy between social capacity and social desire highlights the growing loneliness epidemic—a trend corroborated by numerous health studies, including those by the U.S. Surgeon General. In such a context, Zuckerberg believes AI could play a meaningful role by providing companionship where human connection is lacking.Despite recognizing the potential of AI to assist with social needs, Zuckerberg clarified that he does not believe AI will fully replace real-world relationships. He emphasized that while AI may serve as a helpful supplement, particularly for those struggling with loneliness or social anxiety, it is unlikely to displace physical, in-person interaction.Zuckerberg stated.Instead, he suggested that AI will more likely fill gaps in social interaction and provide new tools for communication, rather than become a full-scale substitute for human connection.One of the factors driving the effectiveness of AI in social tasks, according to Zuckerberg, is personalization. As AI systems continue to learn and adapt based on user interactions, their ability to provide emotionally resonant and context-aware responses improves.He noted that as personalization “kicks in,” the relationship between AI and user becomes more compelling. This echoes a broader industry trend where AI agents are designed to retain memory, adjust tone, and even reflect empathy in long-term interactions.This raises important design considerations for developers—particularly around ethical boundaries, data privacy, and mental health implications.While Zuckerberg expressed optimism about AI’s role in supporting relationships, the growing popularity of AI companions also introduces several ethical concerns:These are ongoing discussions in academic and technological circles, and while Zuckerberg touched on some of them indirectly, the industry as a whole will likely need clearer frameworks as AI relationships become more prevalent.Meta’s investments in AI extend across multiple platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and the metaverse. The company has rolled out various AI-powered features designed to enhance user interaction, such as content suggestions, virtual assistants, and automated moderation tools.Looking forward, Zuckerberg’s comments suggest that Meta may deepen its exploration of AI-driven social features, with an emphasis on user support, mental health, and emotional intelligence.",Mark Zuckerberg: Don’t judge AI in social roles too soon.

In February, Anthropic showcased its Claude AI’s progress in Pokémon Red, a sibling game to Pokémon Blue, emphasizing Claude’s ability to handle complex tasks through enhanced training. This inspired Joel Z’s Gemini project, though he cautions against direct comparisons, as Gemini and Claude rely on different tools and inputs.To navigate the game, Gemini uses an “agent harness” that processes game screenshots with overlaid data, enabling the AI to make decisions and issue commands. Joel Z admitted to providing minor interventions to refine Gemini’s reasoning, such as clarifying a game mechanic involving a Rocket Grunt, but stressed these were not explicit hints or cheating.“Gemini Plays Pokémon is a work in progress,” Joel Z explained, noting ongoing improvements to the system. Meanwhile, Anthropic’s Claude has yet to complete Pokémon Red, leaving Gemini’s success as a notable milestone in AI gaming prowess.","Google's AI, Gemini 2.5 Pro, has completed Pokémon Blue.

Grand Theft Auto VI will launch on May 26, 2026, according to Rockstar’s announcement on May 2, 2025.

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for Grand Theft Auto VI, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

Apple, Google and Snapchat slam utter disregard of sensitive information

New Shocking Details Emerge

Facebook and Instagram parent Meta, led by Mark Zuckerberg, has stumbled into a Huge blunder, igniting fury among legal teams from tech giants Apple, Google, and Snapchat . As first reported by Futurism, the latest chapter of Meta’s ongoing antitrust trial has exposed a series of egregious errors, with the company’s mishandling of sensitive court documents at the center of the storm. During the trial, Meta’s legal team presented slides containing confidential details about competitors, supposedly redacted for protection. However, the redactions were so poorly executed that anyone with access to the files could easily uncover the information. While the exposed data wasn’t catastrophic -- one slide, per The Verge, merely noted that iPhone users favor Apple’s messaging app over Meta’s—the breach has raised serious concerns about Meta’s competence and respect for legal proceedings.Snapchat’s legal counsel lambasted Meta’s “cavalier approach and casual disregard,” questioning whether the company would have been so careless if its own secrets were at stake. Apple’s attorneys went further, hinting they may hesitate to share internal documents with Meta in the future, citing a breakdown in trust. Google’s team echoed these sentiments, warning that Meta’s negligence could set a dangerous precedent for handling proprietary data in high-stakes litigation.This isn’t Meta’s first brush with controversy. The company previously faced backlash for “Operation Ghostbusters,” a covert effort to siphon user data from Snapchat to gain a competitive edge. In 2019, Meta also suffered a massive data breach that exposed personal details of 533 million Facebook users due to a security flaw exploited by hackers. These incidents paint a troubling picture of a company struggling to safeguard sensitive information—whether its own or others’.The current debacle unfolds amid a landmark antitrust lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which accuses Meta of stifling competition by acquiring rivals like Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, and Oculus instead of innovating to compete. A key focus of the trial is Meta’s failed 2013 attempt to buy Snapchat, which Snap’s leadership rejected, much to Zuckerberg’s frustration. The FTC argues this move reflects Meta’s broader strategy of neutralizing threats through acquisition rather than fair competition.In a defiant PR statement, Meta dismissed the FTC’s case as “weak” and out of touch, insisting that its competitive landscape extends far beyond Snapchat. “The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows,” Meta declared, pointing to rivals like TikTok, YouTube, and X as proof of a vibrant, competitive market.Adding fuel to the fire, recent court filings have revealed that Meta allegedly pressured smaller startups into “cooperation agreements” to avoid being crushed by its market dominance. Sources close to the case claim Meta offered these companies access to its vast user data in exchange for exclusivity deals, effectively locking them out of partnerships with competitors. While these claims are still under investigation, they bolster the FTC’s narrative of Meta as a monopolistic bully.As Meta scrambles to contain the damage, its latest misstep has done more than embarrass the company -- it’s deepened skepticism about its ability to operate responsibly in an industry where trust and precision are paramount. With the antitrust trial ongoing and new allegations emerging, Zuckerberg’s empire faces an uphill battle to restore its credibility.","Facebook and Instagram parent Meta has stumbled into a Huge blunder, igniting fury among legal teams from tech giants Apple, Google, and Snapchat.

Google has a ‘Star Wars’ surprise for fans

It started “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....” and is now celebrated by Google . Observed globally on May 4th each year, Star Wars Day is a yearly celebration of George Lucas's iconic Star Wars saga. For fans across the world, this day has become a special occasion, deeply linked with the popular phrase “May the Fourth be with you.”This date-specific pun, cleverly derived from the series’ renowned line, ""May the Force be with you,"" has grown into a worldwide phenomenon. On this day, enthusiasts, cultural organisations, and even businesses participate in various festivities to honor the enduring legacy of Star Wars.The playful twist “May the 4th be with you” gained traction among fans in the years following the 1977 debut of the first Star Wars film. Interestingly, the phrase even found its way into a British political advertisement in 1979, celebrating Margaret Thatcher's victory as Prime Minister on May 4th of that year.While May 4th has become the widely recognized Star Wars Day, some dedicated fans consider May 25th, the original release date of the first film, as the true official celebration. The Los Angeles City Council even declared May 25th as Star Wars Day in 2007. However, in 2019, the California Legislature officially designated May 4th as Star Wars Day.Google has also jumped on Star Wars Day celebrations. When you go to Google and type “Star Wars”, confetti in the shape of R2-D2, Yoda, C-3PO, Darth Vader, and more characters fall from the top of the screens.Three buttons slide up from the bottom, giving users the option to quit, unleash more confetti, or share the experience with friends and family.This year, the day is being celebrated both big and small. Disney+ is marking the occasion with the launch of a new series, Star Wars: Tales of the Underworld, while the second season of another fan-favorite, Andor, is also getting underway.","Star Wars Day is celebrated globally on May 4th each year.

Monaco E-Prix Round 6 highlights





Pit Boost in Formula E double-headers

Nissan driver Oliver Rowland won Part 1 of the Monaco E-Prix on Saturday. He is already leading the Formula E Drivers' Standings this year, and the much-awaited win adds to his score. Nyck de Vries of Mahindra Racing secured the second spot on the podium. Andretti driver Jake Dennis managed to claim the third spot despite a 5-second penalty.The race began with qualifying winner NEOM McLaren’s Taylor Barnard on pole position, followed by good friend — Nissan’s Oliver Rowland — and then Cupra Kiro driver Dan Ticktum, who topped both free practice sessions.The race ended early for TAG Heuer Porsche driver António Félix da Costa, who crashed into the wall and retired. He remains the only Formula E driver in the last five years to have won both pole and the race in the same event — in 2021. He had finished third in the previous race in Miami.Mitch Evans of Jaguar TCS Racing, who won the last Monaco E-Prix, came to a halt during the race and struggled to get going again, losing precious time as others overtook him.Oliver Rowland was among the first to use Attack Mode and established his dominance in the race. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries and TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein came close to Rowland when others took the mandatory Pit Boost. Soon after, Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy moved up to challenge for second position.Where did pole winner Taylor Barnard go? He crashed into the wall and was seen reversing his vehicle to rejoin the race. Andretti driver Jake Dennis could have secured a higher podium finish, but he was hit with a 5-second penalty for overspeeding during the full-course yellow when António Félix da Costa’s car was being removed from the crash site.Pit Boost is a feature introduced in Formula E double-headers. The electric Gen3 Evo cars receive a 10 percent energy boost (3.85 kWh) via a 30-second, 600kW charge in the pit lane. However, a driver can use this advantage only once across the two races in a double-header.","Nissan driver Oliver Rowland won Part 1 of the Monaco E-Prix on Saturday.

A.J. Brown’s stunning proposal to longtime girlfriend melts hearts of Eagles fans everywhere



In what may go down as one of the most memorable off-field moments of the NFL offseason, Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver A.J. Brown took a major step in his personal life. On May 3, the All-Pro receiver got engaged to his longtime girlfriend and mother of his son, Kelsey Riley , in a lavish and heartfelt proposal that instantly won over fans and fellow athletes alike.The proposal wasn't just a private affair—it was a full-blown spectacle of love and celebration. Brown chose none other than the Four Seasons in the Comcast Center in Center City for the special moment. And as if the location alone wasn’t dreamy enough, he had R&B legend John Legend himself serenade the couple live on piano. As Brown dropped to one knee, Legend played and sang, creating a scene straight out of a romantic film.“Having John Legend perform live while I proposed was something out of a dream,” Brown’s post seemed to suggest, as fans got a glimpse of the magical moment through a video he shared on social media.Kelsey Riley, a proud graduate of Texas Southern University and a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., was visibly moved by the grand gesture. The couple, who share a child together, looked absolutely radiant against the stunning backdrop of the Philadelphia skyline.The proposal wasn't short of star power either. The celebration drew several of Brown’s current and former teammates, including cornerback Darius Slay, defensive back Isaiah Rodgers, wide receiver DeVonta Smith, and linebacker Nakobe Dean, all showing up in support of the newly engaged couple.Brown's engagement adds to a growing trend among Eagles players this year—getting not just championship rings, but wedding rings too. Just recently, offensive tackle Lane Johnson also proposed to his girlfriend, Kelsey Homer. Quarterback Jalen Hurts took it a step further, secretly tying the knot with longtime partner Bryonna Burrows, as revealed in Men’s Health magazine on April 22. Even DeVonta Smith, who attended Brown’s proposal, had his own romantic milestone when he proposed to Mya Danielle on New Year's Eve.Now a Super Bowl champion, All-Pro athlete, motivational speaker, and soon-to-be husband, A.J. Brown’s life seems to be peaking both on and off the field. His proposal was a beautiful reminder that while touchdowns matter, life’s biggest wins often happen outside the stadium.With wedding bells ringing across the Eagles roster, it’s safe to say love is soaring high in Philadelphia.Also Read: Alex Smith hints it’s disrespectful to ask Travis Kelce for Taylor Swift concert favors, says real friendships don’t come with ticket requests",Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver A.J.

The strategic advantage of announcing a delay before Trailer 2



The wait for Trailer 2 may be shorter than expected



Rockstar Games has officially confirmed a delay for Grand Theft Auto VI, which is now scheduled to come out on May 26, 2026, rather than in the originally planned Fall 2025 timeframe. Although a lot of fans are disappointed, it's the kind of move Rockstar has made a habit of making: delaying releases so that the company can meet its high standard of quality. Revealing the delay prior to Trailer 2 might actually play in Rockstar's benefit, and here's how.Timing is everything when it comes to fan expectation management, particularly when there are delays. By telling fans about the delay ahead of releasing Trailer 2, Rockstar provides fans with a head start to absorb the disappointment. The openness enables the company to state the cause of the delay, usually to polish the game and make sure it is up to their standards.While it is difficult to accept a delay, making the announcement prior to releasing the trailer enables Rockstar to change the topic and anticipation. The fans have time to adjust and acclimatize to the additional wait, putting realistic expectations in place before the release of the trailer. If Rockstar were to put out Trailer 2 first and then announce the delay, it would overshadow the hype and buzz created by the trailer, leaving possible disappointment in place of enthusiasm among fans.This strategy is in line with Rockstar's method used with Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2), where delays were sequentially taken over by robust communication and promotional content. Indeed, RDR2 was delayed multiple times yet created enormous hype upon the eventual release of the end product. Fans saw the delays as worthwhile for quality, and the end result was beyond expectation, making the wait altogether worthwhile.With the delay now confirmed, fans can expect to see Trailer 2 in the near future. Rockstar Games has a track record of keeping momentum going with solid promotional content, and with the new release window scheduled for May 2026, it's safe to say that Trailer 2 will be released soon to re-spark excitement. Considering the trend of the industry teasing major games with a series of trailers, Rockstar should be no different in releasing new content within the next few months to maintain the hype.By releasing Trailer 2 ahead of schedule, Rockstar might further fuel interest and keep fans waiting with bated breath. This action would be in line with the marketing tactics observed in their past major titles, in which trailers are released at a strategic time to keep long-term hype going. With GTA VI being among the most highly awaited games globally, fans can have confidence that additional content is bound to be imminent, giving us a glimpse into what is set to be an incredible experience.This release timing strategy keeps the game at the forefront of the public imagination and makes sure that despite the long wait, Rockstar never loses the enthusiasm for GTA VI. The fresh trailer will offer fans a glimpse of what lies ahead and sustain the excitement level until the release of the game.Also Read: GTA 6 pushed to 2026 and if RDR2 taught us anything another delay could follow","Rockstar Games has confirmed a delay for Grand Theft Auto VI.

A tried-and-true approach from Rockstar seen in the RDR2 delay history



""polish and finalize the title.""

Another delay is always a possibility



Rockstar Games has formally pushed Grand Theft Auto VI to May 26, 2026, a change from its initial Fall 2025 launch date. While this is a letdown for impatient fans, the news is not completely shocking. Considering Rockstar's history, this postponement follows a tried-and-tested pattern of pushing big titles into the last leg of development. And as Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2) demonstrated, a further delay is always an option.When Red Dead Redemption 2 initially was announced, it was supposed to be out in Fall of 2017, but Rockstar moved it to Spring 2018 within a short period. Then they delayed it once again, until the game came out in October 2018. Rockstar's motive behind the delay was always the same: ensuring that they get the game as polished and as refined as their high standards would allow. There were never any technical issues specified, only dedication to quality.Fast forward to GTA 6, and the plot is uncannily familiar. Initially scheduled for a Fall 2025 release, the game has now been delayed until May 2026 with Rockstar citing needing more time toFans who have seen Rockstar's releases are well aware that this isn't the first time Rockstar has pushed back a flagship project, and it probably won't be the last.Poring over RDR2's launch timeline, enthusiasts have learned to rein in expectations. Even as there is the confirmed new launch date of May 2026, there's room for a couple more postponements. As with RDR2's string of postponements, Rockstar may postpone GTA 6 one last time while they strive towards perfection. It is not a big deal that the studio extends release dates so they can pack as much as they can into the final game.The delays, while irritating, are an indication of the dedication of Rockstar to providing the best gaming experience. Still, based on their past, players should be wary and anticipate additional shifts to the GTA 6 timeline.Ultimately, Rockstar's pushback of GTA 6 to May 2026 is consistent with the company's long-standing policy of delaying launches in order to refine. Considering RDR2’s history, fans can’t avoid speculating whether the release date will be delayed further. As ever, patience will be a virtue for those looking forward to the next installment in the Grand Theft Auto franchise.Also Read: UK retailers face dilemma as GTA 6 launch follows national bank holiday","Rockstar Games has formally pushed Grand Theft Auto VI to May 26, 2026.
