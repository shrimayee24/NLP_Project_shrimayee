Rhodes further revealed that he NEVER skips breakfast. For him, breakfast is the most essential meal of the day and he likes to have it first thing in the morning as part of his routine. Stressing on this fact, this former AEW EVP confided in the interviewer, “I'm an egg whites guy. Basic, dry wheat toast guy. I don't really have any breakfast meat because of the sodium and the added salt.” Cody further revealed that he prefers to avoid meat as part of his breakfast and likes to keep it really simple.The wrestler further revealed that he eats every three hours to keep his hunger pangs in check and to maintain a target calorie intake daily. He avoids having Korean beef or steak as it feels to heavy for him. Although, Cody prefers charbroiled chicken on the side of any type of rice, stating this combination to be his “comfort” food. “It's boring, but it's almost always white rice, grilled chicken and Thai peanut sauce.”Rhodes has further revealed that he absolutely hates vegetables. Although he is aware of their benefits for him. Consequently, Rhodes and his trainers have come up with a way to trick himself into having broccoli and other vegetables by simply hiding them in his meals. The WWE champion also revealed that he takes care of his calorie intake while travelling by making a few conscious food choices, like ordering food but asking them not to put mayonnaise on top, skip the buns, and even request for no oil in some foods. Since the athlete requires to move from one city to other more often, these few hacks have helped him in the long run.Since health is 70% diet and 30% workout and our wrestlers are no less, let us check out Cody's workout routine and training regime.The 38 years old part-Cuban wrestler had starred in an episode of Sheamus’ Celtic Warrior Workouts, where episode 127 was all about “Cody Cutter Workout”.

Missing King Henry VIII portrait found by art historian scrolling on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/missing-king-henry-viii-portrait-found-by-art-historian-scrolling-on-social-media/articleshow/112089490.cms,"An art historian has identified a missing portrait of King Henry VIII after spotting it on social media .Adam Busiakiewicz, an art historian and consultant for the auction house Sotheby's , made the discovery while browsing X on July 4. In a picture shared by the Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire Tim Cox, Busiakiewicz noticed a painting in the background that caught his attention.The art historian's expertise led him to identify the artwork as he noticed the portrait in a photograph which showed a gathering at Warwick’s Shire Hall. The painting is believed to be one of a series of 22 portraits commissioned in the 1590s by local politician and tapestry-maker Ralph Sheldon .Busiakiewicz was immediately reminded of Sheldon’s series of portraits, which depicted kings, queens, and other notable figures of the time. These portraits were originally displayed in the Long Gallery of Sheldon’s home, Weston House, in Warwickshire. The distinct arched tops of the paintings were a signature feature, designed to fit into an architectural frieze at the gallery.In a blog post earlier this month, Busiakiewicz wrote that he had been “scrolling at speed” when he noticed the painting on the wall. He noted the distinctive arched top and similarities to other surviving examples of Sheldon’s commissioned portraits. In an engraving made by antiquarian Henry Shaw in 1839, King Henry VIII is shown holding a sword and wearing a feathered hat, matching the discovered portrait.“These were once incorporated into an architectural frieze of the Long Gallery at Weston,” Busiakiewicz explained. “The arched top was a special feature of the Sheldon set.”The series of portraits was dispersed at auction, and most have remained untraced. Intrigued by the painting, Busiakiewicz visited Warwick’s Shire Hall with local historian Aaron Manning to examine it more closely. He remarked on his blog on July 22, “The portrait is large, and completely in-line with the otherSheldon portraits .”A spokesperson for Warwickshire County Council confirmed the historians' visit. ""Adam and Aaron viewed the painting at Shire Hall, and have confirmed they think it is definitely one of the Ralph Sheldon commissions,"" the spokesperson wrote. ""Since this discovery, the painting has been moved into our Museum Collections Centre to allow further research to take place.""The artist responsible for the portraits remains unidentified, said Busiakiewiczalthough the individual is occasionally called ""The Sheldon Master."" Currently, Busiakiewicz is focusing his efforts on determining the painting's origins and history. The council obtained the artwork in 1951, but there are missing details in the documentation“Provenance is always such a really tricky thing - it’s very hard sometimes to find, particularly when pictures are sold privately,” Busiakiewicz told CNN. “But there’s no doubt that this is Ralph Sheldon’s painting of Henry VIII.”Busiakiewicz also told CNN that this wasn't his first significant discovery through social media. In 2018, he identified a work by 17th-century female artist Joan Carlile from a picture a friend posted on Instagram. He added, “Social media is a crazy thing because some people use it to watch cat videos and follow what’s going on in the world, and then people like me just look at what people have hanging on their walls.”Reflecting on his work, Busiakiewicz said, “Looking at paintings and pictures of paintings is my life and it’s great fun, particularly when you can in some way right a historic wrong, let’s say. Pictures that are overlooked, pictures that aren’t appreciated as much as they might be.""","Adam Busiakiewicz, an art historian and consultant for the auction house Sotheby's, made the discovery while browsing X on July 4.

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

Uber adds Concurrent Rides' feature: What it is and how it may solve this key problem many users face,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uber-adds-concurrent-rides-feature-what-it-is-and-how-it-may-solve-this-key-problem-many-users-face/articleshow/112123585.cms,"What it means for users

Uber is expanding its services in India and is rolling out a new feature that allows users to book up to three rides simultaneously, a report has said. The feature, already available in several global markets, will reportedly be rolled out gradually across India.According to a report by TechCrunch, Uber has not specified which Indian cities will initially offer the concurrent rides feature.“As we understand that one may need to book a ride for their loved one at the same time as they are in an Uber — we launched concurrent rides late last year globally. It allows riders to book and track up to three concurrent rides,” an Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch.At the time of writing, the concurrent rides feature was not rolled out for Time of India Tech team members.The new feature is purportedly aimed at capturing a wider customer base, especially those without smartphones. This means that the guest rider will not need to have the Uber app to book a ride.Those with Uber accounts can now book rides for friends or family members and share trip details via WhatsApp or text message. The message contains the driver’s full name, cab model and registration number, Uber’s contact number to reach the driver, a link to track the ride, and a four-digit PIN to start the ride.Uber has allowed booking rides for someone else for some time now but this has been restricted to one user. For payments, the one who has booked can pay via the app or the rider can pay the driver via cash. Similarly, in the concurrent rides feature, all multiple riders can pay the driver in cash or via the app.Notably, the move positions Uber ahead of its competitor, Ola, which currently allows two rides at a time with limited payment options.It does not allow users to make two bookings at same time using a single online payment method, which means the one who is booking must either choose two different online payment methods or pay via cash.","Uber is rolling out a new feature that allows users to book up to three rides simultaneously.

Google Gemini may soon allow further editing of AI-generated images,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-gemini-may-soon-allow-further-editing-of-ai-generated-images/articleshow/112097581.cms,"Google brings this “Gemini's big upgrade” to free version

Google's AI model, Gemini, is poised to redefine image editing . According to recent reports, the tech giant is developing a new feature that will allow users to make precise modifications to AI-generated images .Currently, users often find themselves starting from scratch when they want to tweak an AI-generated image. However, this upcoming update is set to change that.With the new tool, users will be able to fine-tune images with greater precision, potentially altering elements like background, objects, or even the subject's appearance.Users can simply circle the desired area of an image with their finger or stylus and then provide text instructions for the desired changes. This intuitive approach eliminates the need for complex descriptions, as Gemini will automatically identify the selected region.While Google hasn't officially confirmed the feature, its potential implications are significant. If realised, this development could revolutionise the creative process for designers, artists, and content creators alike.Recently, Google has announced a significant upgrade to its Gemini AI chatbot. The company is introducing the Gemini 1.5 Flash large language model (LLM) to the free version of its chatbot, providing faster response times and enhanced accuracy.“Today we’re upgrading our free-tier experience to Gemini 1.5 Flash. With Gemini 1.5 Flash, you’ll notice across-the-board improvements in quality and latency, with especially noticeable improvements in reasoning and image understanding,” the company said.","Users will be able to circle the desired area of an image with their finger or stylus and then provide text instructions for the desired changes.

Google Photos is making a significant upgrade to its Memories feature, giving users more control over which faces appear in their nostalgic photo collages. The tech giant is rolling out a new tool that simplifies the process of hiding individuals from appearing in Memories.As reported by Android Authority, Google is now making it easier to hide faces in Google Photos.Previously, users had to navigate through multiple menus to exclude specific people from their photo retrospectives. The new update promises a more streamlined approach, allowing users to directly hide a face from a photo's details page. This change is expected to make the process quicker and more intuitive.While Google hasn’t officially announced a release date for the new feature, it’s anticipated to be available to users in the coming months. This update comes as a welcome relief for many users who have expressed frustration over seeing unwanted faces in their Memories.To hide individuals from Memories in Google Photos, navigate to the app's settings menu, then go to Preferences > Memories, and select ""Hide people and pets."" This action will enable you to conceal individuals from appearing in your memories, creations, or on the search page without deleting any of the photos they are in.The report mentions that Google has simplified this process by reducing the number of steps. As per the APK teardown users will have to now open a photo and swipe to Metadata. After this, they just have to tap on three dots in the People section and tap on the hide face option. Users can choose to either reduce the frequency of a person's appearance or completely block them from showing up in any photo memories.","Google Photos is making a significant upgrade to its Memories feature, giving users more control over which faces appear in their nostalgic photo collages.

Anand Mahindra on AI: …is going to be of significantly more value to us than we imagined,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/anand-mahindra-on-ai-is-going-to-be-of-significantly-more-value-to-us-than-we-imagined/articleshow/112095975.cms,"How X users reacted to Anand Mahindra’s post

Anand Mahindra said that artificial intelligence (AI) can be of more value to mankind than ‘imagined’. Citing a research that showed how AI can detect breast cancer five years before it develops, he wrote ""If this is accurate, then AI is going to be of significantly more value to us than we imagined and much earlier than we had imagined,"".The Mahindra Group chairman took to microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to share his views.Recently, a team of researchers from Duke University in the US developed a new AI model to predict 5-year breast cancer risk from mammograms.Traditional cancer diagnosis relies on biopsies, microscopic histological examinations, and imaging techniques like MRI, CT, and PET scans. Human interpretation of these tests can be subjective. AI, on the other hand, can analyse medical images with staggering accuracy.An IANS report quotes Vineet Nakra, a radiation oncologist at Max Super Speciality Hospital on how AI is helping in cancer diagnosis and treatment. She told the news agency that AI is helping pathologists diagnose cancer much faster and paving the way for doctors to make personalised and patient-centric cancer care.Commenting on Mahindra’s X post, a user wrote “That's the best use of technology anyway. Assisting human kind to become better and reduce risks”. “AI in the medical field will have a huge impact and will certainly make significant contributions. Google DeepMind's AI system, AlphaFold3, can accurately predict the 3D structure of proteins and has potential applications in drug discovery and understanding diseases,” commented another.“AI, Machine Learning, Big data analysis based systems will drastically improve the living standards of life of every strata of society,” replied a third.","The Mahindra Group chairman took to microblogging platform X to share his views.

"UK, EU question Elon Musk’s X over use of data to train Grok AI: What they said",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uk-eu-question-elon-musks-x-over-use-of-data-to-train-grok-ai-what-they-said/articleshow/112082799.cms,"Also Read:

How X’s auto-consent flouts tech rules in the UK, EU

Elon Musk-owned X recently enabled by default a setting that allows the social media platform to utilise user data to train its AI model, Grok. This means X can use user posts, interactions, and outputs from Grok for training and refining its AI, requiring users to manually opt-out. Now the regulators in the UK and the European Union ( EU ) have reportedly connected with the company over its alleged attempt to gain user consent for data harvesting without their approval.While X claims this data is essential for improving user experience, privacy concerns have been raised. The setting states that users “allow your posts as well as your interactions, inputs and results with Grok to be used for training and fine-tuning”.Users have expressed difficulty in disabling this feature as the option is currently hidden within the web app's settings and unavailable on the mobile app.The move contradicts the tech laws in both the regions as the regulations prohibit pre-ticked consent boxes. Tech companies are not allowed to use “pre-ticked boxes” or “any other method of default consent”.Data protection authorities in the UK and Ireland have expressed their concerns over X's actions, as per a report by the Guardian. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is investigating the matter, emphasising the importance of transparency and user choice in data usage.“Platforms seeking to use their users’ data to train their AI foundation models must be transparent about their activities,” said a spokesperson for the ICO.“They should take steps to proactively notify users well in advance of using data for these purposes, and provide people with ample time and simple processes to object to having their data used in this way,” the spokesperson added.Similarly, Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), the lead regulator for X in the EU, has expressed surprise at the development and is seeking further information from the company.“The DPC has been engaging with X on this matter for a number of months, with our latest interaction occurring as recently as yesterday, therefore we are surprised by today’s developments. We have followed up with X today (July 26) and are awaiting a response. We expect further engagement early next week,” said Graham Doyle, a DPC deputy commissioner.","X recently enabled by default a setting that allows the social media platform to utilise user data to train its AI model, Grok.
