'Crossed all limits': Kolkata model's towel dance for International Men's Day at India Gate goes viral; netizens demand action,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/crossed-all-limits-kolkata-models-towel-dance-for-international-mens-day-at-india-gate-goes-viral-netizens-demand-action/articleshow/115473322.cms,"Sannati Mitra, a Kolkata-based model, is facing backlash for a video posted on Instagram. The video, intended as a tribute to men, shows Mitra dancing in a towel at Delhi's India Gate.

Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge

NEW DELHI: A recent Instagram video posted by Kolkata-based model Sannati Mitra has gone viral, sparking widespread outrage online. In the video, Mitra is seen dancing in a white towel at the iconic India Gate in Delhi, recreating a famous sequence from the Bollywood classicThe footage, uploaded in celebration of International Men's Day , quickly garnered over 2 lakh views within hours, but not without drawing sharp criticism from the public.In her caption, she wrote, ""Happy International Men’s Day. May you all continue to inspire and motivate others with your courage, kindness, and empathy.""Viewers expressed their displeasure at the seemingly inappropriate setting for such a performance, particularly in a public space revered for its historical significance.The footage shows Mitra twirling in the towel, with a visibly shocked crowd—including children—looking on. At one point, she partially removes the towel, further fueling the backlash.Social media users were quick to condemn the act, with many calling it a blatant attempt to gain fame through ""cheap tactics"" and ""obscenity.""While the video has caught the attention of many, it’s not the first time Mitra has faced controversy. Earlier, she had stirred a similar debate after sharing a photo taken at a Durga Puja pandal in Kolkata.In that instance, Mitra posed with two other women, wearing outfits that many considered unsuitable for a religious setting—Mitra herself donned a thigh-high slit black gown, while her friends wore similarly revealing attire.The incident sparked a wave of criticism on social media, with many condemning the women for disrespecting the occasion and the religious significance of the pandal.In response to the latest video, some social media users expressed outrage at what they perceived as a lack of respect for the martyrs commemorated at India Gate.One Instagram user demanded that Mitra be arrested for her actions, stating that she had ""crossed all limits"" by performing in such a manner at a site sacred to the nation. Another user voiced their frustration, calling for authorities to take action against the ""vulgarity"" displayed in a public place, especially in light of the historical importance of the location.Despite the backlash, Mitra defended her actions, stating that the video was intended as a tribute to the courage, kindness, and empathy of men.However, the public's response has been overwhelmingly negative, with many calling for stricter measures against such acts in the future.","Sannati Mitra, a Kolkata-based model, is facing backlash for a video posted on Instagram.

In a humorous new promo for the upcoming Invictus Games, Prince Harry shared a lighthearted moment with country singer Jelly Roll , where he joked about getting a tattoo on his lower back or 'a**.' The video, shared on Instagram, shows the Duke of Sussex sitting in a tattoo chair at East Side Ink tattoo shop in New York City, awaiting his “artist.”“Is he going to be here any time soon?” Harry asked, to which a staff member assured him the tattoo artist would arrive shortly.The suspense was quickly broken when Jelly Roll, whose real name is Jason Bradley DeFord, walked in wearing black gloves and greeted the prince with enthusiasm. “Hey, hey! Tattoos. Speaking of, what’s up, man?” the country star said, adding that he was “such a fan” of Harry.Jelly Roll expressed his surprise upon learning that Prince Harry wanted him to give him his first tattoo, but Harry clarified that he wasn’t there for a tattoo. Instead, he wanted Jelly to help promote the Invictus Games, which are set to take place in Vancouver in February 2025.Harry humorously added, “There’s no tattoo in this. I can’t get a tattoo.” However, Jelly Roll insisted that if Harry allowed him to give him a tattoo, they could play a game for the Invictus Games. With that, Harry gave in, saying, “Aight, screw it. Let’s go.”When Jelly suggested getting the tattoo on Harry’s neck, the prince joked, “I was thinking like, my lower back or my a**,” adding, “That’s the place where no one’s going to see it.” The singer then went on to jokingly tattoo “I am Jelly Roll” on Harry’s neck, which caused both men to laugh before Jelly quickly exited the room.The video ended with a message announcing Jelly Roll’s performance at the Invictus Games closing ceremony on February 16, 2025.Prince Harry, who founded the Invictus Games in 2014, has worked to create an international multi-sport event for wounded, injured, and sick servicemen and women.

Queen Elizabeth II's wedding cake slice sold in auction. Guess price?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/queen-elizabeth-iis-wedding-cake-slice-sold-in-auction-guess-price/articleshow/115093939.cms,"Queen Elizabeth II

Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip's wedding cake slice, a 77-year old piece, was sold in an auction in Scotland.The cake's slice has been preserved for nearly eight decades since November 20, 1947, which is now not suitable for consumption but still sold at the price of Rs 2.36 lakh ($2,800) . The slice remains carefully preserved in its original small box, featuring a silver insignia of the then-Princess Elizabeth and contains an ornate doily, CNN reported.The cake was originally dispatched from Buckingham Palace to Marion Polson, who served as housekeeper at Holyrood House in Edinburgh, Scotland, as a token from the royal couple.Polson also received a letter of gratitude from Elizabeth for ""such a delightful wedding present.""The letter, typed and signed by Elizabeth, stated: ""We are both enchanted with the dessert service; the different flowers and the beautiful colouring will, I know, be greatly admired by all who see it.""""This is a present which we shall use constantly, and whenever we shall think of the kindness and good wishes for our happiness which it represents.""The original wedding cake stood impressively at nine-foot tall (2.7 metres), weighing 500 pounds.The cake's decorations included both families' coats of arms and sugar-iced figures depicting the couple's preferred activities. It provided 2,000 portions for guests, with additional slices distributed to charities and organisations, whilst one tier was reserved for the then Prince Charles' christening.Other preserved slices have appeared at auctions over the years, with Christie's reporting a piece selling for £1,750 ($2,300) in 2013.In comparison, a slice from Charles and Princess Diana's wedding cake, preserved in plastic wrap within an old cake tin, achieved £1,850 (then $2,565) at auction in 2021.This four-decade-old cake piece displayed a coat-of-arms in gold, red, blue and silver, accompanied by a silver horseshoe and leaf spray, plus white icing embellishments.","Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip's wedding cake sold in an auction in Scotland.

Judge Mehta asked the justice department and the states that brought the antitrust case to submit solutions by the end of Wednesday to correct the search monopoly.Beyond the sale of Chrome, the govt asked Judge Mehta to give Google a choice: either sell Android, its smartphone operating system, or bar Google from making its services mandatory on phones that use Android to operate. If Google broke those terms, or the remedies failed to improve competition, the govt could force the company to sell Android at a later date.The govt also asked the judge to stop Google from entering into paid agreements with Apple and others to be the automatically selected search engine on phones and in browsers. Google should also be required to allow rival search engines to display the company's results and access its data for a decade, the govt said. The proposals are the most significant remedies requested in a tech antitrust case since the justice department asked to break up Microsoft in 2000. If Judge Mehta adopts the proposals, they will set the tone for a string of other antitrust cases that challenge the dominance of tech behemoths, including Apple, Amazon and Meta.Being forced to sell Chrome and Android would be among the worst possible outcomes for Google. Chrome, which was introduced in 2008 and is free to use, is the most popular web browser in the world, with an estimated 67% of the global browser market, according to Statcounter, which compiles tech market data. Android is the world's most popular mobile software, with an estimated 71% of the market, according to Statcounter. The system is open-source, meaning that Samsung and other phone manufacturers do not have to pay Google for its use. But most Android devices come with Google's apps already installed.Google is set to file its own suggestions for fixing the search monopoly by Dec 20. Both sides can modify their requests before Judge Mehta is expected to hear arguments on the remedies this spring. Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, called the govt's proposal ""extreme."" ""DOJ's wildly overbroad proposal goes miles beyond the court's decision,"" he said. ""It would break a range of Google products - even beyond Search - people love and find helpful in their everyday lives.""","The US justice department and a group of states asked a federal court late Wednesday to force Google to sell Chrome, its web browser.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"UK regulator says Apple ‘blocked’ browser innovation on iPhones; company says, “We are concerned that…”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uk-regulator-says-apple-blocked-browser-innovation-on-iphones-company-says-we-are-concerned-that/articleshow/115570965.cms,"Apple-Google search deal under lens

What Apple has to say

Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users. We disagree with the findings in the report regarding Safari, WebKit, and in-app browsing on iOS. We are concerned that the interventions discussed in the report for future consideration under the Digital Markets, Competition, and Consumers Act would undermine user privacy and security and hinder our ability to make the kind of technology that sets Apple apart. We will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.

The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has provisionally found that Apple's policies are hindering innovation in mobile web browsers. The regulator also targeted Google’s $20 billion search deal with Apple in keeping the revenues flowing for the companies.The CMA's inquiry group specifically criticised Apple's requirement that all iOS browsers use its WebKit engine, which limits the functionality and differentiation of competing browsers.“The group has provisionally found that Apple’s rules restrict other competitors from being able to deliver new, innovative features that could benefit consumers. Other browser providers have highlighted concerns that they have been unable to offer a full range of browser features, such as faster webpage loading on iPhone. Many smaller UK app developers also told us that they would like to use progressive web apps – an alternative way for businesses to provide apps to mobile users without downloading apps through an app store – but this technology is not able to fully take off on iOS devices,” the CMA said.The CMA's report also highlights a revenue-sharing agreement between Apple and Google, suggesting that the arrangement reduces their incentive to compete with each other.“In addition, the group has provisionally found that a revenue-sharing agreement between Google and Apple significantly reduces their financial incentives to compete in mobile browsers on iOS,” it added.The CMA launched its investigation into Apple and Google's mobile dominance in 2021, focusing on app store practices, browsers and cloud gaming. While the CMA has dropped the cloud gaming aspect of its probe due to recent changes by Apple, it maintains concerns about Apple's browser policies.“The CMA is inviting comments on its provisional findings by December 13 and expects to make a final decision in March 2025,” it added.An Apple spokesperson said that it disagrees with the findings, as per a report by TechCrunch.",The UK's Competition and Markets Authority has provisionally found that Apple's policies are hindering innovation in mobile web browsers.

Apple is reportedly working on a new version of Siri,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-is-planning-to-launch-a-chatgpt-like-siri-in-2026/articleshow/115560951.cms,"While Apple is temporarily partnering with OpenAI to enhance Siri's capabilities, the company is simultaneously developing its own large language models to power a more advanced version of its digital assistant, aiming to compete with ChatGPT and other AI assistants. The plan is to have the Siri overhaul ready for launch by spring 2026, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.The upcoming overhaul, internally dubbed ""LLM Siri,"" aims to enable more sophisticated back-and-forth conversations and faster request processing across iPhones, iPads, and Macs. The company plans to announce these changes as part of iOS 19 and macOS 16 software updates, codenamed Luck and Cheer, Bloomberg reports.This builds upon the enhanced Siri coming with iOS 18 as a part of Apple Intelligence, which features a new glowing interface, richer language understanding, onscreen awareness, and the ability to perform actions across apps while allowing users to search through emails, notes, and documents privately. The 2026 version will further advance these capabilities, using Apple-built AI models to provide ChatGPT-like interactions while expanding its ability to control third-party apps through App Intents.In the meantime, Apple will introduce ChatGPT integration into Apple Intelligence next month, with plans to add other chatbot options like Google's Gemini in the future. Bloomberg reports that the company wants to build the features of these external chatbots into Siri to maintain its focus on user privacy.Recent job listings suggest Apple's commitment to these developments, seeking candidates with expertise in conversational AI interfaces. The company has already restructured its Siri team, moving the interaction group from its AI division to its software interfaces team, now led by Alan Dye, vice president of human interface design.","Apple is developing a new version of its digital assistant, codenamed Luck and Cheer.
