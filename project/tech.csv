Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Google is developing a new feature for the Play Store that will help Android users easily track and access their installed games. The ""Continue Playing"" section, set to appear in the Games tab, aims to streamline game access by eliminating the need to search through device launchers.The feature, discovered in version 43.4.23-31 of the Play Store app, will display installed games in a carousel format with direct launch capabilities, as reported by Android Authority. Each game listing will show either the last played timestamp for active games or the installation date for unused titles.This feature would address a common challenge on Android devices, where games often get lost among numerous installed apps without a dedicated games section in most launchers. The carousel interface prioritises recently played games, placing them at the front for quick access.While the feature appears ready for deployment, it's currently not available in the stable version of the Play Store. The timing of the public release remains unconfirmed, but the feature's apparent completion suggests it could roll out to users in an upcoming Play Store update .","Google is developing a new feature for the Play Store that will help Android users easily track and access their installed games.

For the first time in Indian television history, two influential power couples from the worlds of technology, business, and philanthropy will grace The Great Indian Kapil Show . This weekend’s much-anticipated episode will feature NR Narayana Murthy and Sudha Murty, the celebrated founders of Infosys and well-known philanthropists, alongside Zomato co-founder Deepinder Goyal and his wife, Mexican model Grecia Munoz (Gia Goyal). A recent teaser released by Netflix has already generated significant excitement, providing a glimpse into the candid, humorous, and heartwarming moments that await viewers. Hosted by comedian Kapil Sharma, the episode is set to showcase personal stories, cultural exchanges, and anecdotes from the lives of these remarkable personalities.In the teaser, NR Narayana Murthy, 78, reflects on his initial meeting with a young Sudha Murty, recalling the profound impact she had on him. Describing her as “a breath of fresh air,” Murthy shared his admiration for her intelligence, kindness, and dedication to social causes. Now married for 47 years, the couple has become one of India’s most respected duos, with Sudha Murty achieving acclaim as an author, Rajya Sabha member, and philanthropist.When Kapil Sharma humorously questioned whether their habits have grown similar over the years, Sudha Murty responded with her characteristic humor and honesty. “I became a workaholic like him and a stickler for time,” she shared, adding, “I cook so badly, but he never complains. Look at Murthy saab's weight — that's thanks to my cooking!” The playful exchange between the Murthys highlighted their mutual respect and understanding, as well as Sudha’s humility and humor about her culinary skills.The episode also introduces Deepinder Goyal, co-founder of Zomato, and his wife, Grecia Munoz, who he married earlier this year. Known for her vibrant personality and background in modeling, Grecia has embraced her role alongside Deepinder, even immersing herself in Zomato’s operations. During the show, Goyal shared an amusing story about how he and Grecia surprised Zomato customers by delivering orders themselves in Gurgaon. The reaction of customers, who were surprised and delighted by Grecia’s appearance at their doorsteps, quickly became the highlight of the conversation.“When Gia delivers the order, the customers can’t help but keep staring,” Goyal laughed, prompting a burst of laughter from the audience and Kapil Sharma. The couple’s chemistry and lighthearted attitude have made them popular among Zomato’s users and the public, with fans appreciating Grecia’s willingness to engage directly with Goyal’s business and her adaptation to Indian culture.This is not the first time Sudha Murty has appeared on Kapil Sharma’s platform. Last year, she joined The Kapil Sharma Show alongside filmmaker Guneet Monga and actress Raveena Tandon, where she shared personal anecdotes about her life and experiences. The audience was captivated by her wisdom and humility, as she recounted stories from her travels, including a memorable instance at an airport where she was labeled “cattle class” for wearing traditional attire. Sudha used humor to narrate her response, underscoring her pride in her cultural roots and her unshakeable confidence.In addition to her philanthropic and literary contributions, Sudha Murty’s previous appearance also revealed her admiration for Bollywood legends such as Shah Rukh Khan and Dilip Kumar, bridging the worlds of Indian cinema and literature.The teaser release has already stirred excitement among fans, who are eager to see the contrasting yet complementary dynamics of these two couples. While the Murthys are admired for their contributions to India’s technology and education sectors, Deepinder and Grecia have gained popularity as a young, modern couple who represent the global, interconnected nature of today’s India.Social media platforms have been abuzz with comments from viewers looking forward to the episode, with many expressing admiration for Sudha Murty’s humility and wit, and curiosity about Grecia’s adaptation to life in India. Fans also anticipate candid moments and stories from the lives of the Murthys and the Goyals, hoping for inspiring takeaways from both the established and next-generation leaders in India’s entrepreneurial landscape.","This weekend’s episode will feature NR Narayana Murthy and Sudha Murty, the celebrated founders of Infosys and well-known philanthropists.

Smartphone glass maker Corning faces EU anti-competition investigation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/smartphone-glass-maker-corning-faces-eu-anti-competition-investigation/articleshow/115022212.cms,"The European Commission has opened a formal antitrust investigation into US glass maker Corning over concerns that its exclusive supply agreements with mobile phone manufacturers may have illegally excluded competitors from the market for break-resistant screen glass.The probe will examine whether Corning, which produces the widely-used Gorilla Glass brand of protective smartphone screens, abused its dominant market position through anti-competitive practices with both phone makers and raw glass processing companies.EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said the investigation aims to determine if Corning's practices have ""deprived consumers from cheaper and more break-resistant glass"" options.Regulators are specifically investigating three types of potentially anti-competitive clauses in Corning's agreements with phone manufacturers: exclusive sourcing requirements, exclusivity-based rebates, and provisions forcing manufacturers to inform Corning about competitors' offers before accepting them.The Commission is also examining Corning's contracts with glass processing companies, which allegedly included exclusive purchase obligations and clauses preventing these companies from challenging Corning's patents.If found to have violated EU competition rules , Corning could face fines of up to 10% of its global annual revenue. However, the company now has the opportunity to offer commitments to address the Commission's concerns before the investigation concludes.Corning's Alkali-aluminosilicate glass, marketed under the Gorilla Glass brand, is used to protect displays on most major smartphone brands. The material has become a standard feature in modern mobile devices due to its scratch and damage resistance properties.The Commission said it will carry out the investigation ""as a matter of priority,"" though no deadline has been set for its completion.","EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said the investigation aims to determine if Corning's practices have ""deprived consumers from cheaper and more break- resistant glass"" If found to have violated EU competition rules, Corning could face fines of up to 10% of its global annual revenue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115022207,imgsize-710285,width-400,resizemode-4/115022207.jpg"

Google reverse image search on WhatsApp: What to expect



WhatsApp is testing a new feature with its latest beta update that allows users to perform a reverse image search on Google for any image they receive. This feature, currently available in the beta version, aims to help users verify the authenticity and origin of images shared on the platform. Google's reverse image search functionality has been available for some time, enabling users to search the web for visually similar images. This can be helpful in determining if an image is original or has been previously shared online. By integrating this capability into WhatsApp, users can now easily check the source and context of images they receive, potentially combating misinformation and enhancing the overall security of the platform.According to a report by WABetaInfo, this feature is now available in build 2.24.23.13 on the Google Play Store for beta testers. This feature integrates with Google Search to help users verify the authenticity and origin of images.To use this new feature, users can tap the three-dot menu when viewing an image and select ""search on web” once it becomes available for them. This will send the image to Google Search for reverse image lookup, which can identify similar images and provide context.WhatsApp assures users that these images will remain confidential and is not shared with Meta or any other platform besides Google.While Google's Circle to Search already offers reverse image search functionality, WhatsApp's new in-app option provides a more direct and convenient way to verify images within the app. This feature, currently rolling out to beta users, is gradually becoming available to more users on the latest version.While the reverse image search feature is included in the latest WhatsApp beta build, its availability seems to be controlled by a server-side rollout. This means that even users on the latest version may not see the feature immediately. However, access is gradually expanding as more users gain the ""search on web"" functionality.","WhatsApp is testing a new feature with its latest beta update that allows users to perform a reverse image search on Google for any image they receive.

Google has won a lawsuit over Google Play gift card scams with a judge ruling that the tech company is not liable for losses incurred by such fraud. A lawsuit claimed that the search giant illegally profited from gift card scams by refusing to refund victims.Citing a decision by US District Judge Beth Labson Freeman, news agency Reuters reported that the plaintiff, Judy May, has failed to demonstrate that Google caused her losses or knowingly received stolen funds. May lost $1,000 in a scam where she was tricked into buying Google Play gift cards.The judge also determined that Google was not liable for retaining its standard commissions –15% to 30% – on purchases made with the gift cards, as this practice was unrelated to the initial fraud.While Freeman dismissed the lawsuit, she granted May the option to refile her case. However, a claim for triple damages was permanently dismissed, the report said.A class action lawsuit against Google was filed earlier this year, alleging that the tech giant illegally profited from gift card scams by refusing to refund victims.The lawsuit stemmed from a $1,000 loss suffered by Indiana resident Judy May, who fell victim to a scammer posing as a relative. The scammer convinced May to purchase Google Play gift cards under the pretence of securing federal grant money. May provided the gift card codes to the scammer, who then used them to make purchases.A class action complaint claimed that “over nearly a decade, Google has knowingly kept millions of dollars in stolen money from victims of gift card scams who purchased Google Play gift cards.”The lawsuit argued that Google should have warned consumers about scams on gift card packaging andthat anyone demanding payment with the cards was a scammer. She also accused the company of profiting from the fraudulent activity by keeping commissions on purchases made with stolen gift cards.","Judy May lost $1,000 in a scam where she was tricked into buying Google Play gift cards.

Kansas City Chiefs Trades: 5 NFL Teams That Boosted Their Super Bowl Odds Most at the Trade Deadline,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/5-nfl-teams-that-boosted-their-super-bowl-odds-most-at-the-trade-deadline/articleshow/115025040.cms,"Getty Images

1. Detroit Lions: All-In for Their First Super Bowl

2. Pittsburgh Steelers: Bolstering Offense and Defense

Acquired: Mike Williams, Preston Smith

3. Kansas City Chiefs: Seeking a Three-Peat with Hopkins and Uche

Acquired: DeAndre Hopkins, Josh Uche

4. Washington Commanders: Strengthening Defense with Lattimore

Acquired: Marshon Lattimore

5. Baltimore Ravens: Reinforcing an Already Explosive Offense

Acquired: Diontae Johnson, Tre'Davious White

The NFL trade deadline saw significant moves from teams eyeing the Super Bowl, with 18 total trades involving 19 players since Week 1. These five teams made major moves to improve their championship prospects.Also read - ""Will Chiefs’ Perfect Season Last? Injury Update on Key Players Raises Questions"" Acquired: Za'Darius SmithThe Detroit Lions, off to their best eight-game start since 1956, made a bold play for veteran defensive end Za'Darius Smith, aiming to offset the season-ending injury of star Aidan Hutchinson. Known for his NFC North experience with the Packers and Vikings, Smith has been effective this season with 26 pressures and five sacks—numbers that outpace Detroit’s next best edge rusher, Josh Paschal, by a wide margin.For Detroit, this trade signals a win-now mentality. With the top-scoring offense in the league and the addition of Smith to fortify their defense, they’re positioned for a historic playoff run in hopes of finally capturing their first Super Bowl.The Steelers addressed offensive and defensive gaps by acquiring wide receiver Mike Williams and linebacker Preston Smith. After George Pickens, Pittsburgh lacked a dependable wideout, making Williams—a dynamic, deep-ball threat—the perfect complement. Known for his big-play ability, Williams has struggled with injuries, but a fresh start in Pittsburgh could reinvigorate his career.Preston Smith adds depth to an already top-tier defense. With T.J. Watt and Alex Highsmith leading the Steelers’ linebacker corps, Smith's arrival enhances their pass rush options. Currently sitting at 6-2, head coach Mike Tomlin seems on track for his 18th consecutive winning season.The Chiefs are on a quest for their third consecutive Super Bowl win—a feat never accomplished in NFL history. Injuries had left Kansas City thin at wide receiver, prompting the acquisition of DeAndre Hopkins. In his first game at Arrowhead, Hopkins quickly showed his impact, with eight catches, 86 yards, and two touchdowns, filling a much-needed role as the Chiefs’ go-to receiver.To further enhance their defense, the Chiefs picked up pass rusher Josh Uche. Known for his 11.5 sacks in 2022, Uche could provide essential support outside of Chris Jones, adding situational pass-rushing power that solidifies Kansas City’s already top-five ranked defense.The Washington Commanders made a key defensive move, trading for cornerback Marshon Lattimore. Known for his elite coverage skills, Lattimore’s presence fills Washington’s long-standing void at the position. With a track record of allowing completion rates below 65% over seven seasons, he brings consistency and skill to their secondary.Rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels emphasized his commitment to reshaping Washington’s culture, saying he wanted to “shift the culture.” The Commanders are hopeful that Lattimore’s experience will propel them toward their first playoff berth since 2020.With the NFL’s top-ranked offense, the Ravens enhanced their arsenal by adding wide receiver Diontae Johnson. Known for his route-running precision, Johnson complements Zay Flowers and Rashod Bateman, giving quarterback Lamar Jackson an expanded playbook as he pursues another MVP-caliber season.On the defensive side, Baltimore acquired veteran cornerback Tre'Davious White. Although past his prime Pro Bowl years, White’s playoff experience is valuable for a Ravens secondary dealing with injuries. The Ravens are hopeful that his presence will solidify their defensive backfield in high-stakes situations.Also read - ""Will Chiefs’ Perfect Season Last?

"""Internet culture has ruined real life"": Former NFL Star Chris Long speaks out on Jason Kelce incident with brutal honesty",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/internet-culture-has-ruined-real-life-former-nfl-star-chris-long-speaks-out-on-jason-kelce-incident-with-brutal-honesty/articleshow/115005431.cms,"Credit: Imagn Images

Chris Long opens up about his honest thoughts on the Jason Kelce incident



Over the weekend, Jason Kelce , the celebrated podcaster and ESPN commentator, found himself at the center of a viral incident while attending the Ohio State-Penn State game in State College. As he was walking down the street, he was unexpectedly accosted by someone who shouted a homophobic slur at him from behind. In a moment of frustration, Kelce turned around, grabbed the person’s phone, and tossed it away—an action that quickly became the subject of widespread attention.Also Read: ""What the hell happened?"": Just before Presidential election, Donald Trump takes aim at NFL’s new kickoff rule, demanding a reversal of policy The incident sparked a flood of opinions on social media, with many weighing in on the situation. In response, Kelce offered a heartfelt apology the following day, stating that he regretted his actions and acknowledged that “fighting hate with hate” was not the solution. Despite this, the internet largely supported Kelce, with many siding with him over the disrespect he faced.What made this incident even more surreal was the fact that it took place in Pennsylvania, the very state where Kelce’s brother, Travis, earned his Hall of Fame status with the Philadelphia Eagles. To see Jason treated in such an aggressive manner in his own backyard, with no provocation, left many shaking their heads in disbelief.Following the apology on “Monday Night Countdown,” former NFL player Chris Long came to Kelce’s defense. He pointed out that the culture of seeking clout has deeply permeated modern society.""I think everything's about clout now in the world now,"" Long said. ""Period. It's hard as even a media member not to fall in these traps. Everybody is chasing clout. It's the quickest way I can get my five minutes of fame. That guy getting the phone smacked out, if it weren't for the fact that it seems like the whole internet turned on this guy ... Nowadays a kid who gets smacked in the face might say hey, look what I got done, I got smacked in the face by Jason Kelce.""""The internet culture has ruined real life and there's too many people who grew up in situations where they never got punched in the face,"" Long added. ""And I'm not saying that's like a prerequisite to being an adult but I'm pretty sure that guy never got punched in the face.""Several current and former players, including Long, confessed that they would have responded far more aggressively than Kelce had they been in his shoes. While the fan’s phone may have been valuable, it’s hard for many to feel sympathy for him as the victim, especially when considering Kelce’s long history of positively contributing to the Pennsylvania community. This episode shines a light on how social media culture can shape real-world events. Though Kelce’s actions may not have been ideal, the overwhelming support from the public suggests that sometimes, people are more inclined to understand a reaction born from frustration than to criticize it.Also Read: Jason Kelce may face a fine for smashing a fan's cell phone who directed a homophobic slur towards his brother","Jason Kelce was accosted by someone who shouted a homophobic slur at him.
