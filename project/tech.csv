Dubai has been long celebrated as a global retail haven, and is now making waves in the world of artificial intelligence (AI). Known for its expansive malls and top-tier brands, the city is seamlessly blending tradition with technology to reshape how consumers shop, interact with brands, and experience retail.Behind the luxurious displays and bespoke offerings lies a layer of AI-powered innovation that‚Äôs redefining personalisation, streamlining operations, and enhancing customer satisfaction. From designing jewellery to curating personalised shopping experiences, Dubai is setting new benchmarks in the global retail landscape.In today‚Äôs retail environment, customers seek experiences that resonate on a personal level. AI has emerged as the linchpin of this transformation. Amreen Iqbal , Founder and Creative Director of Piece of You, a custom jewellery brand in Dubai, emphasises the depth of this shift: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about understanding the customer deeper‚Äîwhat they want, how they want it, and how we can make it special and unique to each customer. AI helps us do that.‚ÄùHer brand employs AI-powered tools to enable customers to design unique jewellery pieces through virtual try-ons and bespoke customisation. ‚ÄúThe ability to personalise jewellery at this level was unthinkable a few years ago. Now, with AI, it‚Äôs a reality,‚Äù she adds.Similarly, global e-commerce innovations have gained traction in Dubai. Sue Azari , an e-commerce consultant at, notes, ‚ÄúAI enables highly customised and intuitive customer experiences.‚ÄùShe cites Zalando‚Äôs AI-powered chatbot as a perfect example: ‚ÄúIf you need an outfit for a Christmas party, you simply describe your needs, and the chatbot curates a complete look, including accessories. It‚Äôs like having a personal shopper who knows your wardrobe.‚ÄùIn the beauty sector, major players like Sephora are redefining the customer journey with AI. Through augmented reality (AR) and AI features, their app enables users to virtually try on products like lipstick shades while integrating seamless social sharing options. Azari explains, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about creating an experience, not just a transaction.‚ÄùWalid BenOthman, Managing Director at Bitpanda, in Dubai, added that AI-driven personalisation has created a 25% improvement in customer satisfaction, revenue, or cost reduction. ‚ÄúAdditionally, AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants provide 24/7 customer support, improving engagement and customer satisfaction.‚ÄùHe explained AI has made it easy to bring in hyper-personalised advertisements by analysing customer behaviour, creating more effective campaigns and higher conversion rates.Adding to Dubai‚Äôs retail innovation is the launch of theat Dubai Mall, as reported. The AI-powered store enhances the telecom retail experience by offering an array of cutting-edge features. Using AI and robotics, customers can explore products, make payments, and even collect purchases from automated lockers.The store is equipped with advanced facial recognition technology, enabling personalised interactions and tailored product suggestions. It epitomises Dubai‚Äôs vision to merge physical retail with AI-driven efficiency. As highlighted in several news reports, this initiative underscores Dubai‚Äôs commitment to revolutionising traditional retail through technology. report by GoGlobe has highlighted that Dubai AI‚Äôs impact extends beyond personalisation, revolutionising how brands market their products. Generative AI (genAI) has emerged as a game-changer, enabling dynamic, hyper-personalised advertisements and streamlining content creation.‚ÄúAI doesn‚Äôt just generate content; it analyses performance metrics to refine strategies in real-time. It saves marketers countless hours and ensures campaigns are efficient and impactful,‚Äù explains Azari.Iqbal highlights AI‚Äôs ability to enhance marketing precision through predictive analytics, helping businesses target audiences with unparalleled accuracy. From creating dynamic ads to optimising email campaigns, AI ensures that every touchpoint is relevant and impactful.At Amazon, for instance, AI-generated product descriptions have not only increased efficiency but also improved SEO performance and consistency. ‚ÄúThis is not just automation; it‚Äôs about making marketing smarter and more strategic,‚Äù notes Azari.While customers benefit from AI-driven personalisation, its operational applications are equally transformative. Gavin Jackson, Senior Vice President of Data and AI at Endava, highlights the role of AI in inventory management: ‚ÄúAI has turned inventory management into a science. Retailers can now accurately predict demand, ensuring shelves are stocked without over-ordering. It‚Äôs a win for both businesses and consumers.‚ÄùJackson explains that AI-powered systems can even trigger additional production when products start selling out, ensuring businesses never miss a sales opportunity. Logistics and supply chains are also undergoing an AI-driven revolution, with systems optimising delivery routes, warehouse layouts, and energy consumption. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about creating an interconnected ecosystem where every touchpoint is as efficient as possible,‚Äù he adds.Dubai‚Äôs embrace of AI is propelling the city into a new era of retail excellence. By integrating advanced technologies across personalisation, marketing, and operations, the city is not only enhancing customer experiences but also setting a global standard for innovation in retail.As Iqbal aptly puts it, ‚ÄúThe ability to create personalised, meaningful experiences isn‚Äôt just a luxury‚Äîit‚Äôs a necessity. And AI makes it possible.‚ÄùDubai‚Äôs commitment to leveraging AI ensures that its reputation as a global retail hub remains stronger than ever, firmly rooted in innovation and customer-centricity.","Dubai is blending tradition with technology to reshape how consumers shop, interact with brands, and experience retail.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, ‚ÄúTo do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.‚ÄùUsers will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses.

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle‚Äôs theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you‚Äôve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you‚Äôve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

The primary sensor on the Galaxy S25 Ultra manages to capture incredible detail and dynamic range. The AI enhancements bring sharper portraits and more accurate colour reproduction. Features like depth-of-field control and Galaxy Log enhance creative possibilities and help users do much more with the camera. Also, the redesigned camera UX allows more intuitive control over advanced settings.

‚ÄúWisdom is learning the lessons we thought we already knew. DeepSeek reminds us of three important learnings from computing history:

1) Computing obeys the gas law. Making it dramatically cheaper will expand the market for it. The markets are getting it wrong, this will make AI much more broadly deployed.

What is Jevons paradox that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella relates DeepSeek 'carnage' to,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-is-jevons-paradox-that-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-relates-deepseek-carnage-to/articleshow/117622441.cms,"What is the Jevons Paradox?

Nadella's concerns

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently drew attention to the Jevons Paradox while discussing the rapid rise of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup. Nadella's remarks came after DeepSeek, an emerging player in the AI space, unveiled its advanced language model, DeepSeek-R1. Nadella suggested that as DeepSeek 's AI becomes more efficient and accessible, overall usage will skyrocket‚Äîillustrating the Jevons Paradox in action.DeepSeek's recent successes, including surpassing OpenAI's ChatGPT in App Store rankings, have shaken up the AI industry. Nadella referenced the Jevons Paradox, explaining that increased efficiency in AI technology, similar to DeepSeek's innovations, leads to greater overall consumption.The Jevons Paradox, an economic principle, states that technological advancements that increase the efficiency of resource use can paradoxically lead to increased consumption of that resource. For example, more fuel-efficient cars might encourage more driving, ultimately leading to no significant reduction in overall fuel consumption.Nadella expressed concern that the increasing efficiency and accessibility of AI could lead to a similar phenomenon. As AI becomes more powerful and easier to use, its applications will undoubtedly expand. This increased usage, even with improved efficiency, could significantly increase the energy demands of AI systems, potentially leading to a surge in energy consumption.Nadella used the term ""Deepsake carnage"" to illustrate this point. Deepsake is an AI-powered platform that can convincingly synthesize realistic videos and audio of individuals. While this technology has potential applications in entertainment and education, it also raises concerns about the potential for misuse, such as creating deepfakes for malicious purposes. As AI capabilities like Deepsake become more sophisticated and accessible, the potential for both beneficial and harmful applications will increase dramatically.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella drew attention to the Jevons Paradox while discussing the rapid rise of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup.

DeepSeek‚Äôs work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant,"" Nvidia said in its statement.‚ÄúInference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling,‚Äù said Nvidia.DeepSeek is a large language model developed by Hangzhou-based startup DeepSeek. The AI model features a hybrid architecture combining reinforcement learning with chain-of-thought reasoning for advanced performance. The model comes in two versions: DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-R1-Zero. The latter offers unsupervised fine-tuning, enabling even more refined reasoning abilities.Nvidia is currently selling a chip called the H20 that is designed to meet the most recent export control regulations. DeepSeek‚Äôs research indicates it utilized around 2,000 of Nvidia‚Äôs H800 chips, specifically designed to comply with US export controls introduced in 2022. Experts previously told Reuters that these regulations, aimed at hindering China‚Äôs AI progress, would likely have minimal impact.Meanwhile, the Chinese AI startup was forced to restrict new user sign-ups to those with mainland China telephone numbers. Reason: The company is citing ""large-scale malicious attacks"" on its systems. ‚ÄúCurrently, only registration with a mainland China mobile phone number is supported,‚Äù the company posted on its status page. DeepSeek did not specify whether the signup curbs are temporary or how long they will last.","Chinese AI firm DeepSeek saw a 17% drop in its share price on Monday, January 27.
