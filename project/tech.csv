What's this whole Beef About?



Favre’s Response: ""I realize now how much that moment impacted his legacy,""



Why is timing critical?



Mark Gastineau confronted Brett Favre for ‘diving’ against Michael Strahan | ESPN 30 For 30

What Fans Are Saying?



Brett Favre has finally responded to the heated exchange between himself and former New York Jets defensive end Mark Gastineau that recently went viral. The video, recorded at a 2023 sports card show , shows Gastineau accusing Favre of ""taking a dive"" during a 2001 NFL game, a moment that allowed Michael Strahan to break Gastineau's single-season sack record.During the infamous 2001 game between the Green Bay Packers and the New York Giants, Brett Favre appeared to deliberately fall down, allowing Strahan to sack him easily. This placed Strahan's season total at 22.5 sacks, just enough to surpass Gastineau's record of 22 sacks from 1984. Some have called it a sportsmanlike gesture, but others, such as Gastineau, said it cheapened the record.In the viral video, Gastineau is visibly upset, saying, “I’m gonna get my sack back, dude.” This candid remark underscores how significant the record was for his career and legacy.In a social media thread, Favre opened up about the situation, providing context for what went down in that game. He emphasized that the play wasn't prearranged but admitted that his split-second decision might have unintentionally disrespected Gastineau's accomplishments.""I realize now how much that moment impacted his legacy,"" Favre shared, also acknowledging how it diminished Gastineau's reputation and value at public appearances like card shows.While responding to the incident, Favre was disheartened by the fact that their private exchange was recorded and publicized on the internet. While the apology was awkward, he reflected a moral high ground by speaking highly of Gastineau's career and recommending him for the Hall of Fame.And just in time for the release of ESPN's 30 for 30 documentary, The New York Sack Exchange , this decades-old controversy is highlighted again. The film is about the New York Jets' dominant defensive line of the 1980s and its most iconic member Gastineau. However, some people reason that someone timed the video to their advantage-the interest generated in the documentary.Fans are split on the issue. While some believe such records, like Strahan's, should come with an asterisk because of occurrences like this, others believe Gastineau's record remains one of the greatest the NFL has ever seen.Where Favre and Gastineau go back and forth, an old debate has been rekindled. However, the two legendary players have been thrown into the spotlight: Gastineau for his hot temper competitiveness, and Favre, for his candid reflection of the game. It reminds us of the passion that defines professional football.Also read - Jason Kelce’s Wife Kylie Kelce's Podcast Takes Over the Charts No. 1 on Apple and Spotify Within Days: Here’s Why Everyone’s Listening","Brett Favre has responded to the viral video of him and Mark Gastineau.

Shaquille O’Neal, Charles Barkley and Jay-Z Go Way Back

The Inside the NBA crew, featuring Shaquille O’Neal , Charles Barkley , Kenny Smith, and Ernie Johnson couldn’t help themselves from cracking a Jay Z joke on the air today. The entire debacle started when Kenny Smith tried to explain how he was too good to compete with Stephen A. Smith, in a free throw competition.Kenny used Jay Z as an example while giving his analogy and was immediately stopped by Charles Barkley. The former Suns legend tapped Kenny on the shoulder and said, “Probably not a good time right now.” Right as the words left Barkley’s mouth, the entire TNT Studio burst out in laughter.Shaquille O’Neal was so embarrassed that he left his chair and stood behind a wall in an attempt to hide his face. Shaq did not return to his seat for a few minutes and hid away as he tried to regain his composure. All Kenny Smith could do was turn to Chuck and tell him, “You’re Silly.”Shaquille O’Neal has been associated with Jay-Z for quite a while now. The two even released a track featuring Nas this summer. Charles Barkley on the other hand has been associated with the Roc Nation mogul in other ways. Back in April 2024, Barkley roasted Galveston, Texas which is the hometown of Beyonce ’s mother, Tina Knowles.Knowles herself acknowledged Barkley’s comments and replied by saying, “Chuck we don't play about Galveston Texas! You better watch it sucker! Our water might not be blue, but it is still the beach and we love it! In fact, what you probably don't know is It's an Island !! Yes me and @angiebeyince still rock our BOI necklaces (Born On The Island). Jay sent this to me and Angie B Yesterday! He asked us if we're gonna let him talk about our city like that! All Good @charleswbarkley we got a great laugh. So yal don't start no S___T”ALSO READ: LeBron’s NBA Job Forces Savannah James to Embrace an Unconventional Christmas After reading Knowles’ reply to his comments, Chuck immediately tracked back and apologized to Beyonce’s fan base.

For those of you who don’t know, Jay-Z is being sued by a woman, who claims that he sexually assaulted her when she was 13.While Jay-Z has denied any wrongdoing, his wife, Beyonce is yet to comment on the situation. Furthermore, he has been catching a lot of heat on social media, which is to be expected considering his association with Sean "" Diddy "" Combs.

What Is Joe Burrow's Batmobile?



How Much did it Cost?



Joe Burrow Keeps It Low-Key



Cincinnati Bengals star quarterback Joe Burrow is entering some very cool territory with his latest buy. Forget flashy sports cars—Burrow just bought himself a real-life Batmobile, and no, it is not just for show. The legendary vehicle from the Batman franchise is now Burrow's, thanks to a hefty $2.9 million price tag.This is not your usual vehicle.

In all seriousness, yes; read that right: ten, and it's just simply a limited edition for either one of the fans, being Burrow or Batman.Burrow revealed his buy on the latest episode of Hard Knocks, in which he was casually sharing news with teammates Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins. He said: ""I don't get it for like, a year, but I bought it."" The wait might be quite extensive for Burrow before driving this monster.The price tag on this iconic Batmobile is jaw-dropping—$2.99 million. So, what does that get you? Burrow’s new ride is powered by a 6.2-liter General Motors engine that produces 525 horsepower, so it’s definitely no slouch in terms of performance.

While it may not be street-legal, it has everything to make any Batman fan feel like Bruce Wayne himself.Ever since the buzz about his shiny new Batmobile started making waves, Joe Burrow has kept things pretty low-key. He hasn’t revealed much about his sleek ride, leaving fans and media alike intrigued. When pressed for details at a recent press conference, Burrow kept his poker face intact. Responding to a curious question about the Batmobile, he coolly replied, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Talk about keeping it mysterious!It's clear that Burrow is embracing his inner Batman but wants to keep those Gotham City vibes on the low for now. Whether or not he's having fun at the expense of his fans or really enjoying the mystique surrounding his ride, it's hard not to like how he can just be cool about it. And honestly, can we blame him? When you're rolling around in something as epic as a Batmobile, a little bit of mystery just adds to the allure.Joe Burrow's Batmobile isn't just a ride; it's his version of the Batcave on wheels. Its sleek, jet-powered engine and supervillain-worthy features have Burrow giving himself a $2.9 million toy that even Bruce Wayne would be jealous of. Whether he's taking it out for a spin in Cincinnati or parking it next to his Super Bowl rings, this Batmobile is the perfect match for a quarterback who's already got a knack for making heroic comebacks. If anyone can pull off the Batman vibe, it's Burrow—just don't expect him to use the smokescreen to disappear after a tough loss!Also read - Taylor Swift Fans Find Adorable Detail in Travis Kelce’s Suite During NFL Game","Cincinnati Bengals star quarterback Joe Burrow just bought himself a real-life Batmobile.

"Why was CEO's murder suspect Luigi Mangione's Instagram taken down, but not his Goodreads?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-was-ceos-murder-suspect-luigi-mangiones-instagram-taken-down-but-not-his-goodreads/articleshow/116231468.cms,"Luigi Mangione (Pic coutresy: X/ kodstrangeer)

A digital footprint can suddenly reach a wide audience.

Facebook and Instagram remove 'dangerous' individuals.

On X, the suspect's account now has a blue check mark.

LinkedIn focuses on policy violations.

Reddit suspends suspects in high-profile crimes.

His Goodreads was made private, then public, then private again.

On TikTok, it varies.

Moments after authorities announced that Luigi Mangione had been arrested in the killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO on Monday, people delved into his digital trail.Strangers commented on what appeared to be Mangione's old Instagram photos from Hawaii and read his reviews of the ""Hunger Games"" series on Goodreads. Within hours, many of his social media accounts had been scrubbed and were no longer accessible to the public. Others remained active.Here's how different social media companies decide whether to scrub a user's digital footprint .When someone goes from having a private life to getting public attention, online accounts they intended for a small circle of friends or acquaintances are scrutinized by curious strangers -- and journalists.In some cases, these newly public figures or their loved ones can shut down the accounts or make them private. Others, like Mangione, who has been charged with murder, are cut off from their devices, leaving their digital lives open for the public's consumption.Either way, tech companies have discretion in what happens to an account and its content.Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act protects companies from legal liability for posts made by users. ""Companies generally have a lot of freedom to decide what content to allow and what content to remove,"" said Jolynn Dellinger, a senior lecturing fellow at Duke University School of Law.Meta , the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has a ""dangerous organizations and individuals"" policy that prohibits organizations and individuals from using its platforms if they ""proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence."" That determination is made on the basis of a user's online and offline behavior, the policy says.That policy seems to have been applied to Mangione, whose Facebook and Instagram accounts were no longer accessible shortly after he was detained.It was not clear whether X has a policy for a scenario like this; the company did not respond to requests for comment.At first, X suspended Mangione's account Monday, then it reinstated it.Mangione's X account was still online as of Wednesday afternoon and had more than 400,000 followers.After someone posted a message on X about Mangione's account being suspended, Elon Musk, X's owner, responded: ""This happened without my knowledge. Looking into it.""The account was back up less than an hour later, and by Wednesday, it had a blue check mark, which indicates it has access to X Premium, a subscription service.LinkedIn restricts accounts if they violate a number of policies. Mangione's account does not appear to violate any of the policies, and his account is still online.""Our policies are clear about what's allowed on platform, and we enforce them consistently for everyone,"" the company said in a statement.On Reddit, Mangione wrote about his health struggles, including back pain and brain fog. His account there has been suspended.A Reddit spokesperson said its policy is to suspend accounts that may be related to suspects in high-profile criminal investigations.Goodreads, where people keep track of their reading habits and review books, does not appear to have a clear policy on how offline behavior could affect an account's status.Mangione's account was restricted Tuesday, but available again to the public Wednesday, before being made private again. The account includes reviews for books including ""The Lorax"" and ""Industrial Society and Its Future,"" better known as the Unabomber manifesto, by Ted Kaczynski. It appeared as if someone, or many people, gained access to Mangione's account Wednesday because new book reviews were posted that day, while he was in police custody.Goodreads did not respond to requests for comment.It is not clear whether Mangione had a TikTok presence. TikTok can ban accounts, but its policies don't make clear how offline behavior may affect that. There are numerous possible user violations, such as posting inappropriate or illegal content, that could get someone banned. TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.","Luigi Mangione's social media accounts were scrubbed after his arrest. His Goodreads account was made public, then private, then public again.

A woman in southwestern China won 10,000 yuan (Rs 1, 16,000) from a competition for abstaining from mobile phone use for eight hours while exhibiting no signs of anxiety.The contest took place at a shopping centre in Chongqing municipality on November 29, as reported by Jimu News.Ten contestants, selected from 100 applicants, were invited to the mall to participate in the competition, which required them to spend eight hours on a designated new bed. Before the contest, they surrendered their mobile phones and were prohibited from using any other electronic devices, including iPads and laptops, the South China Morning Post reported.In emergency situations, participants could use older mobile phone models with only calling capabilities, provided by the competition organisers, to contact their families.They were also required to adhere to a bed restriction rule, which allowed them to leave the bed for toilet breaks, but limited them to a maximum of five minutes each time.The organisers set a quota for the total amount of time contestants could be away from their beds throughout the eight-hour period, although this detail was not disclosed in the news report.Drinks and meals were provided, and participants were instructed to consume them in bed.In addition to being prohibited from using their mobile phones, competitors were not allowed to fall into a deep sleep or exhibit anxiety. They wore wrist straps to monitor their sleep quality and anxiety levels.Most contestants spent their time reading books or simply resting with their eyes closed.Ultimately, after verification by event officials, a woman surnamed Dong was declared the champion, achieving a comprehensive score of 88.99 out of 100. The organisers noted that she spent the longest time in bed, did not experience deep sleep, and displayed the lowest level of anxiety.The 10,000-yuan prizewinner donned pyjamas for the competition, earning her the nickname “pyjama sister” on mainland social media as the no-mobile-phone race gained viral attention online.Dong is a sales manager at a finance firm. In her spare time, she typically tutors her child and rarely browses her mobile phone aimlessly.The identity of the company sponsoring the competition and the purpose behind holding this event, which occurred in a mattress and bedding shop within the mall, remains undisclosed.","A woman in southwestern China won 10,000 yuan (Rs 1, 16,000) from a competition for abstaining from mobile phone use for eight hours.

'Ban OnlyFans': Adult star Lily Phillips breaks down after sleeping with 101 guys in one day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ban-onlyfans-adult-star-lily-phillips-breaks-down-after-sleeping-with-101-guys-in-one-day/articleshow/116215033.cms,"I Slept With 100 Men in One Day | Documentary

Adult star Lily Phillips , originally from Derbyshire, became a TikTok sensation in October after engaging in an extreme challenge—sleeping with 101 men in a single day. However, in new footage, she described the experience as ""intense"" and admitted she is uncertain whether she would recommend it to others.The 23-year-old, who has earned £2 million through OnlyFans , shared her emotional reflection in a documentary by YouTuber Josh Pieters titled I Slept With 100 Men in One Day. Despite previously expressing enthusiasm for the challenge and her work, the behind-the-scenes footage shows a different side, with Lily visibly shaken and in tears.Speaking through tears, she told Pieters, ""It’s not for the weak girls, if I’m honest – it was hard. I don’t know if I’d recommend it. It’s a different feeling. It’s just one in, one out; it feels intense."" When asked if the experience was more overwhelming than she anticipated, she confirmed: ""Definitely.""Despite the emotional toll, Lily recently expressed interest in attempting an even larger challenge—sleeping with 1,000 men in a single day. The revelation has sparked a wave of public debate, with some calling for a ban on OnlyFans, the platform for which the content was created.One social media user wrote, ""Lily Phillips reflects on her sadness after sleeping with 100 guys in 1 day – 1) she’s responsible for her own behaviour in this sick stunt, 2) it’s also clear OF has turned women into plastic dolls – and the 'models' themselves have bought this heartbreaking lie.BAN ONLYFANS NOW."" The tweet has since amassed over 7.7 million views and 19,000 likes.Critics claim the footage highlights the damaging impact of OnlyFans, with one commenting, ""Lily Phillips talking about how traumatic it is to sleep with 100 men is exactly why we should be against OnlyFans."" Another said, ""Look at this woman’s eyes. She has degraded herself so badly for validation. I pray she reflects on this stunt and sees her own intrinsic value. OnlyFans is making this possible, and it needs banning.""However, not everyone agrees that the platform should be banned. Some empathised with Lily, with one user writing, ""Poor girl. She needs a big hug."" Others argued she made her own choices, with one person stating, ""She chose to do this and profit from it. Are we supposed to feel sorry for her?""Supporters of OnlyFans contend the issue is more nuanced. ""OnlyFans isn’t inherently good or bad. Society needs to get better at dealing with it. Banning is very rarely, if ever, the answer,"" one user argued.","Adult star Lily Phillips became a TikTok sensation in October after engaging in an extreme challenge.

Shared love for animals

Middleton family’s competitive spirit

Prince William has revealed a unique way to avoid the ""fiercely competitive"" atmosphere of the Middleton family's game nights, taking James Middleton 's beloved dog, Ella, for a walk.As noted in James’ book, ‘Meet Ella: The Dog Who Saved My Life’, Ella offered the Prince of Wales the perfect excuse to step away from the fast-paced card game Racing Demon.James wrote, “Ella gave him a perfect excuse to avoid the fiercely competitive atmosphere of the Middleton household, especially during our favourite fast-paced card game, Racing Demon.”Royal expert Christopher Andersen echoed this sentiment, saying that William and Kate Middleton’s card games are “intense and all-consuming,” often prompting William to look for ways to steer clear of the competitive streak that runs deep in the Middleton family.However, away from these heated games, William reportedly has no hesitation in challenging Kate in private competitions.As per RadarOnline, James Middleton shared insights on The Dog podcast, describing William’s lighthearted approach to the family games. He noted that William would often ask, “James, does Ella need a walk?” before the game even began, much to the knowing amusement of the Middleton siblings.James wrote in his memoir that William, despite his rigorous military training, was ""thrilled to be the first out of the game"" and would happily retreat to cuddle Ella once eliminated.William’s affection for animals has been a longstanding trait.According to People.com, William grew up surrounded by dogs and shared this love with his late grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and his maternal grandmother, Frances Shand Kydd.While William hesitated to get another dog after losing a beloved pet in his youth, Kate encouraged him to welcome Lupo, a black cocker spaniel, into their family in 2011.The Wales family welcomed a new cocker spaniel named Orla in 2020. James Middleton bred the dog. This followed the death of their previous dog, Lupo.James reflected on how William has become an integral part of the Middleton family, telling People that the Prince has been “fantastic in offering advice and support” and fully embraces his role as both a family member and future king.James added, “William has no qualms about taking part in our family traditions , even if he’s more comfortable cheering from the sidelines.”Christopher Andersen, speaking to Fox News Digital, explained that competition runs deep in royal and Middleton families alike.He noted that the late Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip enjoyed spirited contests, while King Charles III’s passion for polo often led to injuries.However, the Middleton family’s drive to win appears unmatched. James confirmed this sentiment, adding that his paternal grandmother would ""thrash"" them at Racing Demon well into her eighties.Kate, who shares her family’s love for games, also highlighted this competitive spirit in a touching September video about completing her chemotherapy. In the message, she revealed how playing card games with her family had provided moments of normalcy during her recovery.Despite the high-energy dynamic of these gatherings, William’s bond with his in-laws remains strong.As James Middleton shared with Hello! magazine, “William has been fantastic in integrating into our family, and we’re proud to have him as part of our lives.”","Prince William has revealed a unique way to avoid the ""fiercely competitive"" atmosphere of the Middleton family's game nights.

A viral phenomenon

Memes and merch

Not the first ‘hot felon’

Who is Luigi Mangione?

The arrest of 26-year-old Luigi Mangione , a suspect in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has turned into a bizarre internet sensation . His mugshot , showcasing what fans call his “Italian good looks,” has gone viral, earning him the nickname “hot assassin” across social media platforms.Mangione’s once-dormant Instagram account, inactive since 2021, has seen an astronomical rise in followers, jumping from fewer than 1,000 to over 27,000 in just days. Comments on his posts range from flirty declarations to passionate calls for his release. “He’s too fine to be guilty,” one user quipped, while another joked, “Where’s the GoFundMe to free Luigi?”True to form, internet users have gone to creative lengths to idolize Mangione. A GoFundMe campaign for his legal defense has been launched, though it has only raised a modest £100 so far. Meanwhile, Twitter (now X) users have flooded the platform with memes and speculative posts, including fan-casting for a hypothetical Netflix series based on his life.Fans have even fixated on Mangione’s outfit during the alleged crime, particularly his Sherpa-lined Levi’s Trucker Jacket. The jacket, retailing for $225 at Macy’s, has become a viral sensation, leading to thousands of searches and hundreds of purchases within days. “Luigi’s jacket is the real star of this saga,” one Reddit user commented.Mangione isn’t the first to gain fame through a mugshot. In 2014, Jeremy Meeks, dubbed the “hot felon,” became an internet star after his mugshot went viral, leading to a modeling career post-incarceration. Mangione’s newfound fame is drawing comparisons to Meeks, though some argue his case carries darker undertones.Hailing from a wealthy family in Maryland, Mangione graduated valedictorian from the prestigious Gilman School and went on to earn dual degrees in computer science and mathematics from the University of Pennsylvania. Once a promising data engineer at TrueCar, Mangione’s life took a turn with his alleged involvement in Thompson’s murder.","Luigi Mangione, 26, is a suspect in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

The nationwide manhunt for the suspect who murdered UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson ended in a place that’s as American as apple pie: a McDonald's. But while Luigi Mangione ’s arrest in Altoona, Pennsylvania, brought relief to authorities, it’s still unclear who will actually claim the $60,000 reward offered for his capture—and it could take a lot longer than you think.It all started innocuously enough when a customer at the McDonald's noticed Mangione, 26, sitting down to a meal and—being the vigilant citizen they were—alerted a staff member. That call to the police set off a chain of events that culminated in Mangione’s arrest and charges in the high-profile killing of Thompson, 50, outside a Manhattan hotel earlier this week.But here’s where things get tricky: despite the considerable reward money—$60,000 from the FBI and NYPD Crime Stoppers combined—there’s no guarantee anyone will be cashing that check anytime soon.As per the report by CNN, when it comes to crime tip rewards, things aren’t as simple as just ""seeing something, saying something."" You can’t just call in a tip and expect to waltz into the local police station to collect your money. In this case, the FBI’s reward stipulates that the tip must lead to the ""arrest and conviction"" of the suspect. That’s right—arrest and conviction.As for the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers reward, it’s similar but with a key twist. The tip must not only lead to an arrest but also to an indictment before any reward money is disbursed. It gets even more complicated when the tipster’s anonymity is involved.The police have not released the identity of the McDonald’s customer or the employee who helped make the arrest possible, and it's unclear if they will ever step forward to claim their cut.One thing’s clear: even if the tipsters do come forward, the process to claim their reward could take months. The NYPD Police Foundation, which handles the Crime Stoppers payouts, has a committee that reviews the case before making a decision. That means no one is getting rich overnight, despite how heroic their actions may seem.In larger cases—like those involving international terrorists or FBI Most Wanted fugitives—things are even more complex. The FBI has a separate program, ""Rewards for Justice,"" where nominees (who cannot nominate themselves) must be put forward by a US investigating agency. But the Thompson case isn’t on that level—yet.","Luigi Mangione, 26, was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after a McDonald's customer tipped off police.

Owners can avoid background checks, making them difficult to trace.Ghost guns are self-assembled firearms with no serial numbers, often sold as kits that include drill bits and jigs for easy assembly.Frames, or ""receivers,"" can legally be sold 80% complete, requiring minimal effort to make operational.In 2022, President Joe Biden introduced rules to curb ghost guns, arguing they are designed for crime. Legal challenges have delayed enforcement, but the Supreme Court recently hinted at support for regulation.Advocates argue these guns are a hobbyist's tool and a constitutional right, sparking a fierce debate over personal freedoms versus public safety.These weapons can also be made using 3D printers, often with removable metal inserts that bypass federal screening laws.","Ghost guns are self-assembled firearms with no serial numbers, often sold as kits that include drill bits and jigs for easy assembly.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Creating a will online : If you are planning to create a will, many online platforms offer easy-to-use tools and resources, allowing you to draft and finalise a will without leaving your home. Here's how to make an online will .Begin by choosing a reliable online service. Look for a platform that has a simple interface, comprehensive templates, and secure storage for your documents.2.Register with the platformTo register, enter your personal information like your full name, date of birth, address, and contact details. Then create a secure username and password to access the online service.Next, make a list of all your assets. Include property, investments, bank accounts, insurance policies, and any valuable items you own.Decide who will inherit your assets by choosing your beneficiaries.

I’m especially excited to see the fast progress on coding, with more to come.

Developers can try an experimental version in AI Studio and Vertex AI today. It is also available to try in @GeminiApp on the web today, mobile coming soon.

We are investing in the frontiers of agentic capabilities with a few early prototypes. Project Mariner is built with Gemini 2.0 and is able to understand and reason across information - pixels, text, code, images + forms - on your browser screen, and then uses that info to complete tasks for you.

Gemini 2.0 in AI Overviews

Google has launched Gemini 2.0, an AI model for the ‘agentic’ era. This model can power AI agents – intelligent assistants that can take command and perform actions on users’ behalf. For example, Google announced Jules, an AI agent that can code, analyse issues and fix them on their own as well as Project Mariner – that can undertake tasks on the web.Google launched AI Overviews – AI generated summaries on topics that require research. Pichai said that the company is bringing the capabilities of Gemini 2.0 to AI Overviews that have reached 1 billion people and continue to bring AI Overviews to more countries and languages over the next year.Google has already started limited testing and will be rolling it out more broadly early next year.“No product has been transformed more by AI than Search. Our AI Overviews now reach 1 billion people, enabling them to ask entirely new types of questions — quickly becoming one of our most popular Search features ever. As a next step, we’re bringing the advanced reasoning capabilities of Gemini 2.0 to AI Overviews to tackle more complex topics and multi-step questions, including advanced math equations, multimodal queries and coding,” Pichai added.","Google has launched Gemini 2.0, an AI model for the ‘agentic’ era.
