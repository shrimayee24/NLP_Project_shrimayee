Turkey earthquake: Did Google fail to alert millions? Here is what the company says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/turkey-earthquake-did-google-fail-to-alert-millions-here-is-what-the-company-says/articleshow/122944835.cms,"



Tech giant Google acknowledged that its earthquake alert system failed to issue critical warnings ahead of the devastating 2023 earthquake in Turkey, which claimed more than 55,000 lives and injured over 100,000 people.Although the Android Earthquake Alerts (AEA) system was active at the time of the twin quakes on 6 February, it failed to recognise the scale of the threat.Just 469 people received the system’s highest-level “Take Action” alert, designed to prompt urgent safety measures, though there were almost 10 million people living within 98 miles of the epicenter.Instead, Google said that around half a million users were issued a lower-level “Be Aware” notification, intended for milder tremors and far less noticeable. This alert does not override settings like Do Not Disturb and would likely have gone unnoticed by most, especially as the first quake struck at 4:17am while many were asleep.The Android-powered system, which operates on over 70% of smartphones in Turkey, initially led Google to claim that it had “performed well,” BBC reported.Internal findings, however, revealed the system had dramatically underestimated the quake’s magnitude, assessing it at just 4.5 to 4.9 on the moment magnitude scale, when in fact it was a 7.8.A second large tremor later that day also saw inaccuracies.This time, AEA issued 8,158 “Take Action” alerts and almost four million “Be Aware” warnings, still falling short of expectations given the quake’s severity.“We continue to improve the system based on what we learn in each earthquake,” a Google spokesperson told the BBC.The AEA platform uses the accelerometers in Android phones to detect ground movement, aiming to give users precious seconds to react before seismic waves arrive. When a strong quake is detected, the system should trigger the loud “Take Action” alert, which bypasses all other settings and fills the user’s screen.This feature was particularly vital in Turkey, where lives could have been saved had people received a timely warning before buildings collapsed. Yet, months of BBC reporting across the quake zone failed to uncover a single user who had received the more serious alert ahead of the first tremor.Google has since published a study in the journal Science, admitting to “limitations to the detection algorithms”.Researchers later ran a revised simulation of the 7.8 magnitude quake, which produced a dramatically different result: 10 million “Take Action” alerts and 67 million “Be Aware” notifications, suggesting the issue lay in the original software design.“Every earthquake early warning system grapples with the same challenge—tuning algorithms for large magnitude events,” Google said.But the long delay in revealing these flaws has raised concerns among experts.“I’m really frustrated that it took so long,” said Elizabeth Reddy, assistant professor at the Colorado School of Mines. “We're not talking about a little event - people died - and we didn't see a performance of this warning in the way we would like.”Some scientists are also worried that countries may be relying too heavily on Google’s alerts, potentially neglecting the development of strong public systems.“Would some places make the calculation that Google’s doing it, so we don’t have to?” asked Harold Tobin, director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network. “I think being very transparent about how well it works is absolutely critical.”Google maintains that its platform is intended to support, not replace, national alert systems.Since the 2023 quake, it has updated the algorithm and expanded AEA to 98 countries.","Google's Android Earthquake Alerts (AEA) system was active at the time of the twin quakes on 6 February, but failed to recognise the scale of the threat.

"Who is Kashish Mittal? From IAS to Microsoft to AI to classical singing, the man going viral for his lyrics and LinkedIn",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/who-is-kashish-mittal-from-ias-to-microsoft-to-ai-to-classical-singing-the-man-going-viral-for-his-lyrics-and-linkedin/articleshow/122899560.cms,"Kashish Mittal’s early achievements and civil services career

Life after IAS: Microsoft and AI

A lifelong passion for music

Kashish Mittal is what every Indian parent dreams of and what every nosy relative secretly resents. An IIT topper (AIR 6), IAS officer at 21, Microsoft techie, AI entrepreneur , and now an Indian classical singer — his career timeline reads like a Bollywood script co-written by UPSC aspirants, tech bros, and art lovers. For the middle class, he was the ultimate “shaadi biodata material” until he did the unthinkable: quit the IAS and followed his heart into music. For relatives, his CV is a nightmare, as they hide their jealousy behind forced smiles, and for many others, it’s simply unbelievable. His bold decisions have left family WhatsApp groups stunned and LinkedIn timelines inspired. Today, his soulful lyrics and viral posts are making him India’s most melodious multi-hyphenate.Mittal’s academic excellence was evident early on. After securing an AIR 6 in the JEE, he pursued electrical engineering at IIT Delhi. In 2009, he cracked the UPSC exam and joined the IAS, becoming one of the youngest officers in his batch. He held significant positions, including serving as the private secretary to the Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog. However, in 2019, Mittal made headlines by resigning from the IAS, reportedly dissatisfied with a transfer to Arunachal Pradesh. His departure from civil service sparked debates and admiration alike.Contrary to popular perception that he gave up all structured work, Mittal joined Microsoft after leaving the IAS, working in AI-driven projects. His tech journey didn’t stop there. In 2025, he co-founded an AI startup focused on human potential and ethical technology. His transition from bureaucracy to big tech and now entrepreneurship reflects his diverse interests and adaptability.Mittal had been training in Hindustani classical music since childhood. Post-IAS, he gave his full attention to music, performing professionally as a classical vocalist of the Agra Gharana. He is an empanelled artist with ICCR and All India Radio, with his compositions reflecting a blend of spiritual depth and technical rigor. His renditions have gained widespread attention online, with many calling him a rare blend of intellect and art.In addition to his performances, Mittal’s presence on social media has contributed significantly to his viral fame in 2024 and 2025. His LinkedIn posts offer a unique blend of personal reflections, career insights, and poetic musings, resonating particularly well with a generation that values authenticity and non-traditional success stories. Screenshots of his profile and posts circulate widely, sparking conversations about breaking free from societal expectations and pursuing passion alongside professional achievement.Moreover, Mittal’s Instagram reels have garnered massive engagement. A particularly viral reel features him singing Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan’s “Unke Andaz-e-Karam,” amassing nearly 3 million views. The video captures his soulful voice and classical training in a spontaneous, relatable setting, often shared with captions reflecting the emotions of love and loss. This blend of classical artistry and modern social media appeal has cemented his status as a multi-hyphenate artist capturing the imagination of India’s youth and beyond. His journey is a reminder that it's never too late to rewrite your story and sing your own tune.","Kashish Mittal was an IIT topper (AIR 6), IAS officer at 21, Microsoft techie, AI entrepreneur, and now an Indian classical singer.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shared a post on X (formerly Twitter), suggesting a shift in his stance toward artificial intelligence . Admitting he had been “living in denial” about the technology for too long, Elon Musk wrote in the post: “I resisted AI for too long. Living in denial. Now it is game on.” Musk was replying to a post shared by an X user Mario Nawfal that quoted Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang who called Musk a ‘superhuman’.While Elon Musk has been both a vocal critic and early investor in AI, he has previously warned about the dangers of uncontrolled AI development, once calling it humanity’s “biggest existential threat.” His latest statement suggests a more aggressive pivot from caution to action.The post comes as the tech billionaire continues to expand his presence in the AI space through xAI , the startup he launched in 2023 to compete with companies like OpenAI , Google DeepMind, and Anthropic.Elon Musk’s relationship with AI has been complex. The tech CEO co-founded ChatGPT-maker OpenAI in 2015, but later distanced himself from the company. Over the years, he has expressed concerns about AI safety, calling for regulation and greater oversight.While Elon Musk did not elaborate on what specific moves might follow his tweet, observers say the post is likely a signal to investors, rivals, and users that he intends to take a more direct role in AI development. Notably, the tech CEO tagged three of his major companies – Tesla, SpaceX and xAI in his post.Elon Musk’s “game on” remark also hints at increasing competition in the AI sector, where companies are racing to release faster, more powerful language models and build new infrastructure to support them.In a related news, Tesla India recently shared a post on X, announcing an update on the availability of Tesla cars in the country. “Now everyone in India can order directly on our website,” the post read, adding that four cities will get priority delivery.

'We must confront them': British woman slammed for criticising Hindi-speaking staff at Heathrow; accused of racism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/we-must-confront-them-british-woman-slammed-for-criticising-hindi-speaking-staff-at-heathrow-accused-of-racism/articleshow/122933874.cms,"(Image: X @LucyJayneWhite1)





A British woman has come under fire after having an issue over Marks & Spencer employees at London Heathrow Airport speaking in Hindi. Lucy White, who describes herself as a public policy specialist, shared her incident in a post on X, which quickly went viral and drew widespread criticism. Many accused her of racism and intolerance in a multicultural environment.White wrote that she had just arrived at Terminal 3 of the airport and visited the M&S store, where she overheard three staff members speaking in a language other than English. When she asked them what language they were speaking, the employees told her it was Hindi, the most widely spoken language in India.“I have a voice recording & their names to report to M&S.

Since 2012, Dubai has been running a unique system to reward safe and disciplined driving. While many drivers are familiar with black points, which are penalties given for serious traffic violation, fewer may know that there’s also a system ofdesigned to recognise and encourage responsible behaviour behind the wheel. This initiative by Dubai Police has quietly been offering meaningful benefits to motorists who consistently follow traffic laws.This article breaks down exactly how the White Points system works, who is eligible, how points are earned and redeemed, and how they can help offset penalties, all in simple terms.The White Points system was launched by Dubai Police in 2012 to motivate motorists to maintain a spotless driving record. It's not just a symbolic gesture, drivers who qualify can receive real benefits that can help them reduce penalties or avoid costs.Unlike black points, which are given for offenses, White Points reward good behaviour. Drivers who avoid traffic violations and fines for an entire calendar year can earn these points.The system is available to drivers who hold a licence issued by the Dubai Government, and it considers violations committed both in Dubai and across other Emirates.To start accumulating White Points, a driver must meet three specific conditions throughout the year:That means even small infractions, like unpaid parking meters or minor Salik toll violations, will disqualify you for that year.Drivers who meet all these requirements automatically start earning White Points, there's no need to apply or register.The system is designed to recognise consistency over time. Drivers earn 2 White Points per month, and if they maintain a clean record for the full year, they will accumulate 24 White Points in total.However, these points are not visible in real-time like black points. You can only check your White Point total after a full year has passed, and only by calling the Dubai Police’s non-emergency hotline (901) or by visiting the Dubai Police Traffic Department in person.White Points are more than just a pat on the back. They can be used once per year to offset certain penalties or fees. These are the four ways you can use them:This system becomes especially helpful for drivers who may have accumulated black points unintentionally. It can also provide relief from administrative and financial penalties in cases where the infraction is minor or borderline.If at any point during the year a violation is recorded against your licence, whether it’s a traffic violation, a Salik fine, or a parking ticket, you immediately become ineligible for White Points that year.Additionally, if a driver violates rules while using someone else’s vehicle, not only does their eligibility get cancelled, but the vehicle owner’s White Points are revoked too. This reinforces shared responsibility for road safety between drivers and vehicle owners.If you’ve already collected black points and aren’t eligible for White Points, there’s still a practical way to reduce the damage. Dubai Police offers specialised traffic training courses aimed at helping drivers regain control of their records and avoid future violations.These courses are designed to educate drivers on:If you're worried about racking up black points, especially if you fall into the 8 to 23 black point range, this program could be a crucial lifeline. By successfully completing the course, drivers can deduct up to 8 points from their record.Drivers with a valid Dubai-issued driving licence who go one full year without any traffic, Salik, or parking violations.You can earn 2 points per month, up to a total of 24 points in one year.Call Dubai Police at 901 or visit the Traffic Department after one year has passed.You can use your White Points to reduce them, or enrol in a traffic training course to remove up to 8 black points if you have between 8 and 23.","Dubai’s White Points system grants 2 points per month to drivers with no violations, totaling 24 points annually for rewards.

If you're new to the UAE, whether as a resident or visitor, and plan to drive, it's vital to understand the country's Black Points System, which is central to how traffic violations are handled. Introduced in July 2017 under Ministerial Resolution No. 178/2017, the system is a powerful tool for promoting road safety by penalizing unsafe driving behaviors. It applies across all emirates, including Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and is a key part of the UAE Vision 2021 for reducing road accidents and fatalities.Violations are tracked using an advanced network of cameras, radars, and AI-powered monitoring systems, and black points are added to your driving license for each offense. Once a violation is confirmed, drivers typically receive an SMS notification within 48 hours, detailing the offense, fine, and black points imposed.The system is designed not just to fine violators, but to accumulate penalties, which can ultimately lead to license suspension or mandatory retraining, especially for repeat offenders or those involved in serious infractions.In both Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the system works on a 24-point scale:Suspension periods:To monitor your point status:Violations in the UAE are grouped by how dangerous they are, with penalties combining black points, fines, and sometimes additional sanctions such as court decisions or vehicle impoundment.These are major offenses that pose a serious risk to public safety and often carryThese infractions significantly raise accident risks and are often committed unintentionally:These are common infractions but can add up quickly for careless drivers:If you're worried about racking up black points, Dubai Police offers a training program for drivers with between 8 and 23 black points.

NCM’s Advice to the Public







Residents across the UAE may want to rethink weekend plans, as the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has issued a weather alert for possible thunderstorms, heavy rain, and strong winds between Friday, July 25 and Monday, July 28, 2025.The forecast points to an unstable weather system developing over the eastern, southern, and some interior areas. The likely culprits? A combination of low-pressure zones, both at the surface and higher up, along with humid air flowing in from the Arabian Sea and Sea of Oman. Add to that the northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and conditions are ripe for cloud build-up, rain, and even hail in some places.Despite the rain, don’t expect cooler days. Daytime highs are still expected to hit the high 40s in inland regions. Humidity, especially in coastal areas, will remain high in the evenings.The NCM urges people to follow official updates and stay clear of valleys and low-lying areas during rain, where water can collect quickly. Outdoor activities, especially hiking or camping in mountainous regions, should be avoided during storm alerts.","Rain, thunder, and possible hail expected across eastern, southern, and inland areas from Friday, July 25 to Monday, July 28.

Why risk management matters for F&O traders

In India's dynamic Futures and Options (F&O) markets, managing risk is as important as identifying trading opportunities. For technical traders navigating volatility, protecting capital is crucial to ensuring long-term success. A well-planned risk management strategy helps minimize losses, control emotional decision-making, and maintain consistency—even when markets move unpredictably.While market structures and brokerages, including Angel One, have introduced several mechanisms to promote safer trading environments, individual discipline remains key. Understanding and using the right tools can empower traders to manage exposure effectively without compromising agility.Extreme volatility or low liquidity can sometimes cause unexpected price movements during order execution. To reduce the risk of unfavourable fills, brokers like Angel One have introduced Market Price Protection (MPP). Under this mechanism, instead of sending pure market orders that may execute at any price, the system automatically converts these into limit orders with a price range buffer.This adjustment helps protect traders from significantly worse prices during fast-moving or thinly traded markets, offering better control over trade execution without requiring manual intervention.Stop-loss orders are a fundamental tool in trading, designed to cap potential losses if the market moves against a position. However, not all stop-loss strategies are static. One way traders can better adapt to changing price action is through a Trailing Stop-Loss, now available on Angel One.A trailing stop-loss automatically adjusts the stop level as the market price moves in a trader’s favor. For example, in a long trade, if the price rises, the stop-loss also moves upward, locking in more favourable exit points. This dynamic method can help traders protect accumulated profits or limit losses without needing constant manual adjustments.By automating the movement of stop-loss levels, trailing stops encourage a more disciplined trading approach, removing emotional bias from exit decisions.Another practical risk management feature traders can use is Set Exit, which allows setting both stop-loss and target level from a single interface in the Positions Book. By defining these levels at the start of a trade, traders can stick to their risk-reward plans more easily.The system incorporates an OCO (One Cancels the Other) functionality—meaning that if either the stop-loss or target is triggered, the remaining order is automatically cancelled. This prevents scenarios where traders might forget to manually close the second order, reducing errors and stress during volatile periods.By streamlining the exit planning process, traders can stay focused on strategy execution while reducing manual monitoring.Risk management doesn't stop at individual trades. Traders often have a broader daily plan, setting limits for maximum acceptable loss or desired profit. However, staying disciplined can be difficult in the heat of trading.Angel One offers a Secure Exit feature that helps traders adhere to these plans. Users can set daily target thresholds across their entire portfolio. When the preset threshold is reached——all open positions are automatically squared off.This approach helps eliminate emotional decision-making, protects gains, and prevents bigger losses that could arise from overtrading. It supports a steady, methodical trading discipline aimed at long-term survival and growth in the market.Volatility in the F&O markets presents both opportunity and risk. Without proper safeguards, traders can experience sudden, large losses that are difficult to recover from. Incorporating tools like Market Price Protection, Trailing Stop-Loss, Set Exit, and Secure Exit can help technical traders manage risks at multiple levels—from individual orders to the entire portfolio.By embedding discipline directly into their trading systems, traders can reduce reliance on emotional responses and create a sustainable trading journey.","In India's dynamic Futures and Options (F&O) markets, managing risk is as important as identifying trading opportunities.

Under Angel One’s Markets section, users can now easily view changes in FII (Foreign Institutional Investors) and DII (Domestic Institutional Investors) positions across various timelines. This visibility can help traders interpret institutional activity and adjust their strategies accordingly.For options traders, seamless execution is key. Angel One’s web platform allows viewing a compact option chain alongside charts, reducing the need to toggle between multiple windows. A smaller Quick Options List is also available directly from the Watchlist, providing easy access to index option contracts when speed matters most.Serious traders often prefer an uncluttered, focused workspace. Angel One’s TradeOne setup allows users to maximize their screen space by viewing charts, positions, and trading balances all in one window. Traders can place and exit orders directly from charts, edit open orders, and track P&L without switching tabs — creating a smoother, faster trading experience.Trading doesn't end with order execution.

Options trading is a dynamic field, requiring not just quick decisions but also carefully crafted strategies to manage risk and maximize opportunities.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Explained: What are new porn rules in UK and that have led to 500%-plus jump in VPN,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-what-are-new-porn-rules-in-uk-and-that-have-led-to-500-plus-jump-in-vpn/articleshow/122936723.cms,"What do the new rules require



VPN usage skyrockets



Privacy concerns and industry pushback



UK has rolled out its strictest age verification laws for online pornography in the world. However, the new age restriction law has led to a sharp rise in VPN usage as users seek to bypass the new restrictions. As reported by The Independent, UK has witnessed 500% increase in searches related to Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). The stringent new regulations, which came into full effect on July 25th, aim to prevent under-18s from accessing pornography and other harmful online material. As per the new law any website offering adult content to UK users must implement “highly effective” age checks to verify that visitors are over 18. These checks may include photo ID uploads, facial recognition, or credit card verification.As per the new law online platforms RedTube, Pornhub and other social media sites such as X and Reddit must block access to adult content unless users pass the strict age verification. UK’s media regulator Ofcom has warned that failure to comply with the law then would be fined for up to £18 million or 10% of global revenue. The law also allow the websites to select the verification method as per their reference as simple age declarations or checkboxes are not longer acceptable. There are chances that some platforms may block UK users completely instead of implementing the checks.As reported by The Independent, after the implementation of strict age verification law, Google Trends data shows that searches for ‘VPN’ in the UK surged by over 700%. VPNs allow users to mask their location, making it appear as though they’re accessing the internet from countries without such restrictions. The legal experts and privacy advocates warn that while Ofcom can geo-block sites, VPNs remain a simple workaround for many users. Critics also argue that the new rules could push users toward unregulated or fringe platforms, increasing exposure to unsafe content.As per the report, some major adult content providers such as Aylo, which operates Pornhub and YouPorn, have called the checks “ineffective, haphazard, and dangerous,” citing risks to user privacy. They advocate for device-based age verification rather than server-side data collection, arguing that the current approach could jeopardise sensitive personal information.As the UK attempts to create a “safer online life,” the rollout of these rules has sparked a fierce debate over privacy, censorship, and digital freedom.","UK has rolled out its strictest age verification laws for online pornography in the world.

How Trump’s ‘Woke AI’ order took a jab at Google Gemini's Woke controversy



What was the controversy regarding Google Gemini



What Google CEO Sundar Pichai said



Samsung Galaxy Watch8: AI on Your Wrist

President Donald Trump’s administration recently issued executive orders aimed at preventing ‘ woke AI in the federal government’. Without naming the company and AI chatbot, the communication issued by The White House highlighted last year’s controversy surrounding Google 's Gemini chatbot for which both CEO Sundar Pichai and company’s chief technologist Prabhakar Raghavan publicly addressed the backlash.The executive order, signed on July 23, states that when “ideological biases or social agendas are built into AI models, they can distort the quality and accuracy of the output.” It specifically identifies “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) as a “pervasive and destructive” ideology that, in the AI context, can lead to the “suppression or distortion of factual information about race or sex,” “manipulation of racial or sexual representation,” and the incorporation of concepts like critical race theory and systemic racism.The White House order said that DEI poses an existential threat to reliable AI.“For example, one major AI model changed the race or sex of historical figures — including the Pope, the Founding Fathers, and Vikings — when prompted for images because it was trained to prioritize DEI requirements at the cost of accuracy,” the White House communication noted.“Another AI model refused to produce images celebrating the achievements of white people, even while complying with the same request for people of other races. In yet another case, an AI model asserted that a user should not ‘misgender’ another person even if necessary to stop a nuclear apocalypse,” it added.A controversy was ignited after a viral post on X (formerly Twitter) by user @EndWokeness showed Gemini generating images of diverse racial backgrounds when prompted for historical figures like American Founding Fathers and popes. It also reportedly portrayed Nazis as racially diverse.These are some examples that drew sharp condemnation, including from figures like Elon Musk, who labeled Gemini's output ""racist"" and Google ""woke.""“The woke mind virus is killing Western Civilization. Google does the same thing with their search results. Facebook & Instagram too. And Wikipedia,” he said.Google was forced to pull the brakes on its Gemini AI image generator following widespread criticism. Pichai publicly addressed the backlash, stating, “Unacceptable, we got it wrong.” He also said that the company is developing the feature from the ground up and fixing the issues.Raghavan admitted that some generated images were “inaccurate or even offensive” and that Gemini sometimes “overcompensates” in its pursuit of diversity. He attributed the “overcompensation” to Google's efforts to avoid AI's classic pitfalls of stereotypical portrayal, but conceded that their “tuning... failed to account for cases that should clearly not show a range.”Google later released Imagen 3 promising significant improvements over its predecessor.","President Donald Trump’s administration recently issued executive orders aimed at preventing ‘ woke AI in the federal government’ Without naming the company and AI chatbot, the communication issued by The White House highlighted last year's controversy surrounding Google's Gemini chatbot.

Meta’s billion-dollar hiring spree



It appears that the competition for top artificial intelligence talent is not going to end anytime soon. Now OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has issued a fiery response to Meta’s aggressive hiring of top AI talent, calling the escalating competition a “war cry” and declaring: “Winning is fun. And I expect to win.” Speaking at a recent podcast interview, Altman addressed the claims that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was using ""mafioso poaching style,"" in order to poach top AI talent from rival companies. “I mean, you know, they want to get into the AI game. I understand it. So, and if he’s going to do this, he needs to hire some people. So, bring it,” Altman said.Earlier this month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman for the first publicly addressed the aggressive hiring by Meta. Replying with a brief ""fine"" and ""good"" when asked about the talent battle with Mark Zuckerberg, Altman said he hasn't spoken to the Meta CEO since the poaching began.""We have, obviously an incredibly talented team, and I think they really love what they are doing. Obviously, some people will go to different places,"" Altman told reporters at the Sun Valley conference. ""There's a lot of excitement, I guess you could say, in the industry. But no, I think we feel fine.""As reported by Benzinga, at a recent podcast appearance, Altman said Meta’s hiring tactics resemble ‘mafioso’ moves“. I mean, you know, they want to get into the AI game. I understand it. So, and if he’s going to do this, he needs to hire some people. So, bring it,” Altman said, adding, “winning is fun. And I expect to win.”The comments come after Meta successfully recruited at least seven OpenAI researchers for its new Meta Superintelligence Labs, including key contributors to OpenAI's reasoning models. Meta’s Superintelligence Labs are headed by former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang. Multiple online reports suggest that the Meta offered a compensation package of $20 million annually to reachers from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and Apple. Notable hires include Apple’s former Foundation Models head Ruoming Pang and seven OpenAI researchers specializing in large language models.Recently, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth also acknowledged this rivalry. In a recent interview to CNBC, Andrew Bosworth, said, “Sam neglected to mention that he’s countering those offers,” referencing rumors of $100 million signing bonuses from OpenAI.With only around 2,000 researchers globally capable of building foundational AI models, the battle for talent is fierce—and increasingly public.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responds to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 'poaching' employees.

Ex-Wife of Coldplay singer tackles PR crisis with strategic video campaign

'Genius' PR move turns viral scandal into brand awareness opportunity

Data automation company Astronomer has hired Academy Award-winning actress Gwyneth Paltrow as its ""very temporary spokesperson"" following a viral scandal that led to the resignation of its CEO and HR chief. The Oscar winner, who was married to Coldplay frontman Chris Martin for over a decade, appeared in a tongue-in-cheek promotional video posted Friday night to help the company navigate public scrutiny.""Astronomer has gotten a lot of questions over the last few days, and they wanted me to answer the most common ones,"" Paltrow said in the video, addressing viewers while wearing a simple black top. The actress, who describes herself as hired on a ""very temporary basis,"" represents the company's 300-plus employees during this turbulent period.The New York-based company became an internet sensation after CEO Andy Byron and Chief People Officer Kristin Cabot were caught in an intimate embrace during a Coldplay concert's kiss cam segment. When the married executives tried to hide from cameras at Boston's Gillette Stadium, Martin joked from the stage, ""Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy.""The footage exploded across social media, generating countless memes and parody videos. Both Byron and Cabot, who are reportedly married to other people, have since resigned from their positions. Astronomer launched a formal investigation, stating that ""our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met.""In the promotional video, Paltrow masterfully sidesteps scandal-related questions, instead focusing on Astronomer's data automation services. When on-screen text shows questions like ""OMG what the actual f,"" she enthusiastically responds about Apache Airflow and data pipeline management. ""We've been thrilled so many people have a newfound interest in data workflow automation ,"" she said.The casting choice appears calculated and ironic – Paltrow's connection to Martin adds layers of entertainment value while helping redirect attention to the company's AI and data automation tools. Social media users praised the move as ""genius"" and a ""PR masterclass,"" with one commenting that hiring ""the ex-wife of the lead Coldplay singer to deliver this message is absolutely savage.""Astronomer's interim CEO and co-founder Pete DeJoy acknowledged the unprecedented attention, noting that the company is ""now a household name"" despite the circumstances. The strategic use of humor and celebrity endorsement represents an unconventional crisis management approach, transforming viral notoriety into potential brand awareness.Paltrow, who ""consciously uncoupled"" from Martin in 2014 while maintaining a close friendship, concluded the video by promising a return to normalcy: ""We will now be returning to what we do best — delivering game-changing results for our customers.""

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Read Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates' complete LinkedIn post here



I’ve entered the startup world again…

When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible. But I’ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

That’s why I’ll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and it’s the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder Sophia Kianni.

They’ve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

It’s been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.

And now, I’ll be doing the same.

Looking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I won’t break anything (no promises).

📲Download the Phia iOS app for free at join.phia.com

💻Or if you shop on your computer like me, they have a free chrome extension at gophia.com

Let me know what you think! You never know who’s on the other end of the customer service line…

Bill Gates daughter shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother



Big Question Answered: Why Google is Merging Android and ChromeOS

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, recently demonstrated a unique approach to leadership and family support by working a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup. In a LinkedIn post Bill Gates revealed that his daughter Phoebe Gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her AI-powered fashion startup — Phoebe and Gates agreed to it. “I’ve entered the startup world again… When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes,” wrote Gates in a LinkedIn post.Phoebe Gates co-founded Phia along with her Stanford roommate Sophia Kianni. The platform uses AI to help users compare prices of new and second-hand products across more than 40,000 websites. A web browser/app, Phia aims to be the Booking.com of fashion, offering an instant price comparison from thousands of e-commerce sites for any item, new or used. Phoebe Gates is the youngest child of Bill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates. Bill Gates joined the customer service team of Phia for one day in order to understand how the product works.Microsoft co-founder revealed that this experience reminded him that “the best way to understand how something works—or where it breaks—is to go straight to the people using it.” His stint echoes a growing trend among tech CEOs to spend time on the front lines, following examples like Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who famously delivered food and drove passengers to better grasp user pain points.Earlier, in April, Bill Gates shared that he intentionally chose not to invest in his daughter’s AI-powered shopping app, Phia, during a podcast. He explained that funding the venture would have led him to oversee it too closely. Instead, he offered advice on staffing while others handled the investment. ""In an interview published by the New York Times, soon after Phia’s web browser and app went live, Bill Gates said: “I thought, ‘Oh boy, she’s going to come and ask.”“I would have kept her on a short leash and be doing business reviews, which I would have found tricky,” the businessman explained of his hesitance. “And I probably would have been overly nice but wondered if it was the right thing to do.”Phoebe Gates recently shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother, Melinda French Gates, about tackling investors. The 22-year-old co-founder of fashion pricing startup Phia got this advice from her mother after she faced queries from potential investors about her future motherhood. While raising funds for Phia with co-founder Sophia Kianni, Gates was asked what would happen if they decided to have children. On the Call Her Daddy podcast, Phoebe shared that this line of questioning prompted a call to her mother. She noted that her mother’s reply was: ""Get up or get out of the game, sis.""According to a report by Benzinga, both founders said that these inquiries expose a persistent bias in venture capital. “Always children,” Melinda Gates said when asked to name the most common bias they’ve faced. Kianni said she turned the tables on a male investor by asking: ""What's going to happen to your venture firm when you have kids?""""He's like, ‘Why would that affect anything?' And I was like, ‘You answered your own question,'” she added.","Bill Gates worked a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup, Phia.
