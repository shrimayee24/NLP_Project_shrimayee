Visa runs are a legitimate and convenient way to extend your UAE stay. By exiting to Oman or nearby countries and re-entering, you get a fresh visa stamp, allowing for a continued stay. Multiple service providers operate daily, offering both border and airport-based options. Ensure you're eligible, have all required documents, and plan ahead to avoid penalties.In the UAE, overstaying your visa comes with clear consequences , and a daily price tag. Once your visa expires, and you're beyond any grace period, you're subject to a fine of AED 50 (~USD 13.60) per day. In addition, you‚Äôll need to pay an exit permit fee of AED 250‚Äì350 (~USD 68‚Äì95) when you leave. These penalties apply across the board, whether you‚Äôre on a visit visa, a tourist visa, or a residency visa.To avoid those penalties and remain in the country legally, many visitors turn to a well-established and structured option: the visa run.A visa run is the process of strategically leaving the UAE temporarily and re-entering, typically on the same day, in order to reset your visa status and legally extend your stay.It‚Äôs most commonly used by those who entered on a 30- or 90-day tourist or visit visa and need more time without switching to a long-term visa.This method doesn't violate any immigration rules. In fact, it operates entirely within the framework of UAE border control and is widely recognized as a legitimate solution for visitors and temporary residents needing more time in the country.Most visa runs are made to neighboring Oman, given its proximity and straightforward land border access from Dubai and other Emirates. Others may involve flying to nearby countries, depending on visa status, timing, or agency arrangements.The process is especially useful for:For nationalities that receive a visa on arrival, this can be a remarkably smooth process, often involving just a short trip to the border, then re-entering the UAE on a renewed entry stamp.Visa runs are a smart solution, but not a free-for-all. They're especially practical for travelers from countries that are eligible for 30-day visa on arrival in the UAE. These travelers can often exit and re-enter without any pre-approval, making the process both fast and relatively low-cost.Here‚Äôs a list of nationalities that currently benefit from the 30-day renewable visa on arrival and are eligible for UAE-Oman visa run services:Additional eligible countries include Uzbekistan and Mongolia. If your country is on this list, you are eligible to enter the UAE multiple times with a new visa issued upon each arrival, provided your documents are in order.It‚Äôs worth noting that border visa runs are typically limited to three consecutive renewals. After reaching this limit, you may want to explore alternatives like the airport-to-airport (A2A) visa switch or returning to your home country to renew or apply for a new visa. Some agencies also offer visa change flights to nearby destinations like Bahrain or Kuwait. Always remember, immigration officials have discretion and may deny entry if they suspect the system is being misused or if your stay doesn‚Äôt appear genuine.The UAE‚ÄìOman border is by far the most popular and practical route for visa runs, especially for travelers holding 30-day visa-on-arrival eligibility. Located about 140 km from Downtown Dubai, roughly a 1 hour 40 minute drive, this border crossing offers a convenient way to extend your stay legally without overstaying your visa. Multiple agencies run daily roundtrip services from Dubai to Oman, making it a dependable and widely used option for visa renewals.Since August 2024, nationals from the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Japan, and New Zealand receive a 90-day visa on arrival, valid over a 180-day period. After using these 90 days, re-entry on arrival is not possible until the next cycle; a pre-approved visa would be required to enter the UAE.That‚Äôs where visa runs or visa changes come in. Visa run services offer early morning (around 7 AM) bus trips to Oman (via Hatta or Al Ain‚ÄìBuraimi), handling all visa paperwork. The package typically includes an express 60-day visa, return transport to Oman, and hotel accommodation during visa processing. You can relax while your visa is approved and return to the UAE by late afternoon (around 5 PM) with your fresh visa, all within the same day.If you're applying for your Omani entry visa yourself instead of going through an agency, you can do this easily through the Royal Oman Police (ROP) website. Select the unsponsored 26A visa, a 10-day tourist visa, upload a scanned passport and photo, and pay the 5 Omani Rial (~AED 48) fee. Processing time ranges from a couple of hours to up to three days. Once approved, print your e-visa and carry a hard copy with you on the trip.In addition to the service fee, budget for:This method is one of the most cost-effective and time-saving visa renewal strategies, provided you're from an eligible nationality and have all documentation in place. It's widely used by tourists, freelancers, job seekers, and anyone in transition to residency.Another option, particularly when land runs are not ideal or permitted due to visa rules, is the airport-to-airport visa run. This involves flying out of the UAE, to Oman, Bahrain, or Kuwait, for example, and returning with a new visa arranged in advance.While this option may require an overnight stay, depending on visa processing times, it‚Äôs often used by travelers whose nationality doesn‚Äôt qualify for a visa on arrival.This method is especially common when border runs are no longer allowed due to visa count or policy updates.Whether you‚Äôre going by road or air, here are the essentials:Though not mandatory, travel and health insurance covering both the UAE and Oman is highly recommended for any visa run.Several agencies in the UAE have made visa runs hassle-free by offering full-service packages that include transportation, coordination, and support:Both providers emphasize planning your visa run at least five days before your current visa expires, allowing ample time to avoid penalties or issues.Visa runs offer a clear, legal, and practical way to extend your stay in the UAE without breaking the rules. When done through proper channels, with the right documentation, timing, and understanding of your eligibility, they serve as a valuable bridge between short-term visits and more permanent arrangements.They're not a workaround or a grey area. They are a recognized tool in the UAE‚Äôs flexible visa framework, especially for tourists, job seekers, freelancers, and families who need more time, and who want to do it the right way.Just remember:And with that, you‚Äôll find that staying longer in the UAE can be as straightforward as a bus ride to the border, and back again.Yes, visa runs are legal and operate within UAE‚Äôs border control system, as long as you follow the rules and have the correct documentation.The cost starts at AED 440 (~USD 120) for a border visa run and AED 1250 (~USD 340) for a 60-day visa extension with hotel accommodation.You‚Äôll need a valid passport, passport copy, current UAE entry stamp, photo, and potentially car documents or a guarantor, depending on your situation.Border visa runs typically take one day, leave early morning and return by late afternoon. Airport-based runs may take 1‚Äì2 days.Border visa runs are generally limited to three consecutive times. After that, you‚Äôll need to explore alternatives like an airport-to-airport visa switch.If you're using the border visa run option, no pre-approval is needed for most nationalities. For other visa options, you may need to pre-arrange the visa.You‚Äôll be fined AED 50 (~USD 13.60) per day plus an exit fee of AED 250‚Äì350 (~USD 68‚Äì95) when leaving the UAE.","Visa runs are a widely practiced and accepted method used by tourists, job seekers, and remote workers to legally extend their stay in the UAE without overstaying.

Lockheed Martin Skunk Works‚Äô history with secret spy planes and UFO theories





Investigative YouTuber Anders Otteson says he filmed a mysterious UFO-like aircraft being tested inside Lockheed Martin‚Äôs secret Skunk Works facility in the remote California desert. He told The Sun that he camped for hours on public land near the Helendale radar-testing site and recorded a dark, wing-shaped object mounted on a tall white pillar. The site is linked to Skunk Works, the defence division behind top secret US military aircraft. The footage shows the craft floating and rotating as if under radar or stealth testing.Anders Otteson, who documents hidden military locations on his YouTube channel, said the object looked like an early-stage fighter jet or an advanced drone. He said it could also be a test model used to check radar reactions, new stealth tech, or special paint.In one part of his video, a distinct blue patch can be seen on the aircraft‚Äôs upper surface. Otteson has filmed at other secret US sites, including near Area 51, and believes Skunk Works may be working on technology that has never been publicly revealed.He told The Sun that the Helendale facility has a 200-foot underground chamber, which has fueled speculation that highly classified aircraft or even possible reverse-engineered technology could be hidden below ground.He said if the United States ever had access to real extraterrestrial or ‚Äúnon-human‚Äù technology, Skunk Works would likely be the group responsible for testing it. He added that the Cold War-era site was specifically built to hide projects from Soviet spy aircraft and satellites.Lockheed Martin‚Äôs Skunk Works division is responsible for creating some of America‚Äôs most secret military aircraft, including the U-2 spy plane, SR-71 Blackbird, and F-117 Nighthawk stealth jet.The Helendale base, located northwest of Victorville, was designed to test radar signatures and stealth performance far from public view.Its long history of classified programs has fueled claims that the US military may be hiding next-generation spy aircraft or even alien-derived technology.Also Read: Influencer Ben Bader Dies Suddenly At 25 After Posting Final TikTok Hours Before Death In recent years, US lawmakers, including Republican Senator Marco Rubio, have demanded answers about multiple unknown objects seen in American airspace.Several high-level hearings have taken place, with officials suggesting that the US is in possession of ‚Äúexotic‚Äù technology not yet understood by the public.Sightings like the one filmed by Anders Otteson only continue to raise public speculation over what might truly be under development inside Skunk Works.","YouTuber Anders Otteson says he filmed a mysterious UFO-like aircraft being tested inside Lockheed Martin‚Äôs secret Skunk Works facility in the remote California desert.

Fans defend Molly Blutstein as backlash over Architectural Digest feature grows







Influencer Molly Blutstein is facing huge backlash online after her Brooklyn apartment was featured in Architectural Digest earlier this month. The 28-year-old content creator, who moved to Cobble Hill, New York City, in July 2025, proudly showed off her small railroad-style apartment that she decorated by herself. The feature was supposed to highlight her unique style and taste. But instead, it turned into a hot topic of online criticism, as people on Reddit, Instagram, and X (Twitter) mocked her design choices and even questioned Architectural Digest‚Äôs decision to feature her home.In her Architectural Digest interview, Molly Blutstein explained that her design style was inspired by ‚ÄúSouthern Gothic details‚Äù and ‚Äúa sort of Shaker, but a bit English-style.‚ÄùShe said she respected Nickey Kehoe, Billy Cotton, Jessica Helgerson, Heidi Caillier, and Beata Heuman. Molly also disclosed that she decorated her home with antique items and painted her kitchen cupboards a soft yellow for warmth and individuality.But the internet didn‚Äôt agree. Many users said her apartment looked ‚Äúunfinished‚Äù and ‚Äúbare.‚Äù One person wrote on Reddit, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so much real design talent being ignored while influencers with empty rooms get magazine features.‚ÄùAnother added, ‚ÄúIf she has a degree in interior design, this is shocking. The apartment looks like a Pinterest draft!‚Äù Even more criticism came when Molly said she disliked mid-century furniture, while people pointed out that her apartment had mid-century pieces. One Instagram user joked, ‚ÄúHonest question, is this satire? That‚Äôs all mid-century stuff!‚ÄùDespite the harsh comments, some fans spoke up in Molly‚Äôs defense. They said that design is subjective and that she should be free to express her own taste. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs her home and her comfort zone.

UAE Hajj 2026 season records 72,000 applications for 6,228 slots





In a sweeping overhaul ahead of the 1447H / 2026 pilgrimage season, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the UAE‚Äôs religious authorities have unveiled strict new health regulations that will decide who qualifies for the sacred journey and who doesn‚Äôt.The General Authority of Islamic Affairs, Endowments and Zakat (Awqaf) has announced that all Emirati pilgrims must pass a comprehensive medical examination confirming their ability to perform the physically demanding Hajj rituals. The authority said it would coordinate closely with Saudi health agencies to screen and verify medical reports, ensuring that every pilgrim meets safety and fitness standards.Awqaf underlined that only those free from chronic or debilitating conditions will qualify, bringing the UAE fully in line with Saudi Arabia‚Äôs stringent health policies.Under the new rules, anyone affected by major organ failure such as kidney or heart failure will be barred from participating.The list of disqualifying conditions also includes:Pilgrims are also required to complete all specified immunisations well before travel, including:The UAE‚Äôs Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP) has issued advisory notes highlighting the importance of physical preparation and injury prevention.Pilgrims are urged to begin light exercise at least three weeks before travel, maintain hydration, and carry essential medicines prescribed by their doctors.Given the extreme temperatures and crowd density during Hajj, MoHAP‚Äôsguidelines include advice to recognise and prevent heat exhaustion or sunstroke. Symptoms such as headache, dizziness, nausea, and rapid heartbeat warrant immediate rest and hydration. The checklist for pilgrims includes:Interest in the pilgrimage remains sky-high despite the tighter rules. Awqaf confirmed that 72,000 applications were filed for the UAE‚Äôs 6,228 allocated slots before registration closed on October 9, 2025.

V2X: What the new system is and why it matters?

Israeli Teen Jailed For Refusing To Serve IDF Over 'GAZA GENOCIDE' Gets Support | WATCH

Countdown Timers: A live display showing the remaining green light duration or the expected delay on the red light.

Optimal Speed Advice: Recommended speeds for drivers approaching an intersection to ensure a smooth, non-stop crossing.

Instant Alerts: Notifications for accidents, road closures, congestion, or necessary detours ahead.

AI-powered traffic management

Real-Time Analysis: The system uses computer vision to analyze footage from roadside cameras. It instantly detects congestion patterns, counts the volume and type of vehicles, and even monitors pedestrians and cyclists.

Intelligent Coordination: The system doesn't just manage one intersection; it coordinates entire road corridors to move ""platoons"" of vehicles smoothly across multiple traffic lights. This network management drastically reduces unnecessary stops.

Digital Twin Simulation: Before any new timing strategy is applied in the real world, the system tests it using a digital twin‚Äîa virtual copy of the road network. This ensures all adjustments are optimized and effective.

Possible roll-out date

Phase 1 Completion (UTC-UX Fusion): The AI-driven dynamic system is on track for full implementation across roughly 300 major intersections by the third quarter of 2026.

V2X Rollout (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure): The new V2X network is scheduled for full deployment and integration across all 620 signalized intersections between 2027 and 2028.

Will my new car be ready?

For New Cars: The RTA is actively collaborating with international car manufacturers to ensure that new vehicles entering the Dubai market are factory-equipped with the necessary built-in connectivity to talk to the V2X network.

For Older Cars: If you own an older vehicle, you will still benefit from the overall congestion reduction and can likely access key information through add-on devices or popular smartphone integration applications like CarPlay and Android Auto that display live traffic data on your screen.





The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in Dubai is rolling out a massive upgrade that will fundamentally change how residents drive.

Why UK government launched this plan



What is the use of ID?



How Veteran can use access digital IDs?



Is it similar to India?







The UK government launched the digital version of its ID scheme on Friday, intended for former members of the armed services.This ID will mean passports, driving licenses, national insurance cards, and many more being virtual, instead of‚Äîor as well as‚Äîbeing stored in a shoebox or under socks in a drawer, Sky News reported.The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.The govt claims the initiative is designed to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for those without status to secure employment.Ministers contend that the ability to obtain jobs is a primary attraction for migrants entering the UK unlawfully. Under the new system, employers will no longer be able to depend on National Insurance numbers‚Äîwhich currently serve as part of proof of the right to work‚Äîor on paper-based verification methods, BBC reported.""At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy‚Äîpeople sharing National Insurance numbers for example. The idea is that having a picture attached would make it‚Äîin theory‚Äîharder to abuse that system,"" a government spokesperson explained.The digital IDs, which will be app-based and stored on smartphones akin to the NHS App or digital bank cards, will contain information such as the holder's residency status, name, date of birth, nationality, and a photograph.Sir Keir, when announcing the scheme, stated: ""You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that.""From today, Friday 17 October, it will give ex-soldiers a seamless way to confirm their status in person and will include information already featured on their physical card with the security features that protect their personal information.Ministers hope the digital veteran card will show how the technology works and quash public concerns about privacy and security.Veterans will now be able to hold their credentials in a smartphone app called Gov.uk One Login. The govt had previously announced that digital credentials, including the veteran card, would be stored in an app named Gov.uk Wallet. It now states it will ‚Äútransition to talking about [One Login] as the Gov.uk Wallet‚Äù as more govt-issued credentials become available digitally. The credential will be stored under encryption in the app, similar to how a train or concert ticket is held in an Apple or Google wallet, The Guardian reported.Verification using face ID or a fingerprint will be required to access it, and the govt claims it is safer than physical IDs. Another version of the credential will be held by the Ministry of Defence, and as more IDs are added, the information will remain with each issuer and in the citizens‚Äô app, ensuring there is no central database of all ID data, thereby avoiding what some have feared could be a ‚Äúhoneypot for hackers‚Äù.India has well established digital ID system. India‚Äôs digital ID system, Aadhaar, is significantly larger and more detailed than the UK‚Äôs planned system.New Delhi stores citizens‚Äô fingerprints, eye scans, photos, home addresses and phone numbers, with the system processing approximately 80 million authentications daily.Under Aadhaar, every Indian citizen receives a 12-digit number intended to replace numerous paper documents. All adults and children over the age of five must provide biometric information. The system verifies identities for activities such as opening bank accounts or applying for new SIM cards. It also aimed to streamline the disbursement of govt benefits, providing holders with instant proof of identity and access to basic services.Aadhaar and UK's digital ID seems to be same.India also have other apps like DigiLocker, where you can store all the important documents like Aadhar Card, Pan card, driving license digitally at one place, Digi Yatra and many more.The UK's digital ID seems to be following the similar model of India. Like DigiLocker, UK is introducing Gov.UK Wallet. Few days ago, UK PM Keir Starmer made his first trip to India and hailed India‚Äôs ID system as a ‚Äúmassive success‚Äù.During his trade-centric visit to Mumbai, Starmer also met with Nandan Nilekani, co-founder and chair of Indian tech services group Infosys, who led the govt body responsible for delivering the ID database more than a decade ago.",The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.

Earth to Eve Verses attack Trump and allies

Social media launch and ripple effect





young artist Earth to Eve has just released a provocative new track and accompanying Instagram reel that targets US President Donald Trump and his network. The song opens with a verse referencing Trump‚Äôs past social ties to Jeffrey Epstein , moves on to highlight his closeness with Elon Musk , then shifts to address lesser-known players like Stephen Miller. In the final bars, she calls out figures like JD Vance, Kristi Noem and Steve Bannon as the ‚Äúsycophants‚Äù enabling this power structure. She also points to recent polling showing Trump‚Äôs approval sliding in key swing states ‚Äî suggesting the crowd is coming home and the kingdom is waning.In her first verse, Earth to Eve uses vivid imagery to allude to Donald Trump‚Äôs association with Jeffrey Epstein ‚Äî a relationship long scrutinised in the media. While the exact photo of Trump with Epstein has been challenged as altered, the broader context of their social connection remains firmly documented.The second verse shifts focus to Trump‚Äôs alignment with Elon Musk ‚Äî portrayed as a public ally and mutual promoter of each other‚Äôs image. The lyric implies that these alliances are far from innocent, suggesting a shared investment in media power, technology influence and political positioning.Here the song introduces names less familiar to the average voter but tightly connected to Trump‚Äôs inner circle: Stephen Miller is referenced as part of the management behind the messaging, the shadow operatives shaping policy and narrative.The lyric paints a picture of hidden influence rather than visible leadership.The chorus broadens the critique: Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and former White House strategist Steve Bannon are grouped as the loyalists ‚Äî the supporters mouthing clich√©s and defending the indefensible. She calls out those who, in her view, reduce politics to spectacle and slogans, while playing crucial roles in shaping Trump‚Äôs current political strategy.In the bridge Earth to Eve references recent data showing Trump‚Äôs approval ratings slipping in several battleground states. The lyric suggests a time when the applause ends, the supporters disperse, and the isolated figure remains. The underlying message is: no king, no god, just human flesh and blood ‚Äî even those at the top are vulnerable when the base evaporates.Earth to Eve introduced the track via an Instagram reel: quick-cut visuals, text overlays quoting lines like ‚Äúno man to vote‚Äù, and snippets of the chorus. The reel has generated strong engagement among Gen Z and young millennials, who are resonating with the idea of rejecting hero-worship in politics.","Young artist Earth to Eve has just released a provocative new track and accompanying Instagram reel that targets US President Donald Trump and his network.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here‚Äôs a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Threads launches 'Ghost Posts' that disappear after 24 hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/threads-launches-ghost-posts-that-disappear-after-24-hours/articleshow/124857821.cms,"Meta says feature designed to encourage authentic, spontaneous sharing





Meta's Threads app is rolling out a disappearing posts feature called ""ghost posts"" that automatically archives content after 24 hours, allowing its over 400 million monthly users to share spontaneous thoughts without permanent consequences. The feature, launching globally now, lets users toggle a ghost icon when composing posts on mobile devices. These posts appear in followers' feeds with a distinctive grayed-out chat bubble, signaling their temporary nature.Unlike standard posts, ghost posts function differently for engagement. When users reply to a ghost post, their responses go directly to the original poster's direct message inbox rather than appearing publicly in the thread. While engagement metrics like likes and replies are visible through smiley-faced icons, only the original poster can see actual numbers and identify who engaged.After the 24-hour window expires, ghost posts disappear from public view but remain accessible to creators through an archived section in the settings menu. This differs from true disappearing messages, as users can unarchive posts whenever desired.Meta says the feature aims to encourage ""authentic, spontaneous expression"" and low-stakes sharing on the platform. The company believes users will feel more comfortable posting unfiltered thoughts, live-threading events, or experimenting with content when they know it won't permanently remain on their profile.The launch comes as Threads continues rapid feature development since its debut in 2023, adding 10,000-character text attachments, spoiler-hiding tools, and interest-based communities over the last two years. The disappearing posts concept echoes Twitter's failed Fleets experiment from 2020-2021, though Meta remains optimistic given the success of disappearing Stories on Instagram and Facebook.","Meta's Threads app is rolling out a disappearing posts feature called ""ghost posts"" The feature automatically archives content after 24 hours, allowing its over 400 million monthly users to share spontaneous thoughts without permanent consequences.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai celebrates new breakthrough in quantum algorithm; Elon Musk replies: ‚ÄòLooks like‚Ä¶‚Äô,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-celebrates-new-breakthrough-in-quantum-algorithm-elon-musk-replies-looks-like/articleshow/124754841.cms,"



What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

‚ÄúNew breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we‚Äôve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.‚Äù

‚ÄòRough news but‚Ä¶‚Äô: Netflix shuts down studio behind game that hit number 1 in 26 countries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/rough-news-but-netflix-shuts-down-studio-behind-game-that-hit-number-1-in-26-countries/articleshow/124805503.cms,"Netflix shift in gaming strategy







Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio‚Äôs co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is ‚Äúvery grateful for the time‚Äù it had at Netflix. Read Rippy‚Äôs full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone ‚Äì well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight‚Äôs closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I‚Äôm very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I‚Äôm very proud of, including Squid Game Unleased which hit #1 in 26 countries. You‚Äôll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles ‚Äì they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through. As for Bill, Scott and me ‚Äì we‚Äôre going to take a little breather before tackling whatever is next. Love to hear from you if there‚Äôs anything interesting going on, workwise or otherwise.Another employee, David Luehmann, a director of game development at the studio, also posted on LinkedIn, saying, ""After 10+ great years working at Boss Fight, the last few as part of Netflix, the time has come for the studio to close down.""‚ÄúI am very proud of all the people, work, and games we've released. I wish you could see what we had cooking! There are many talented people that have been impacted by this. If anyone is looking to grow, I'll have many recommendations for you!‚Äù he added.Netflix acquired Boss Fight Entertainment in 2022 as part of its effort to diversify revenue streams by building out its video game offerings, news agency Reuters reported.The studio was known for developing two games available on the platform: Netflix Stories and the highly successful Squid Game: Unleashed, which reportedly hit the number one spot in 26 countries.The streaming giant's move follows an earnings call earlier this week where Co-CEO Greg Peters specifically praised Squid Game: Unleashed as an example of the kind of narrative game the company wanted to create based on its original shows.However, the company, which named Alain Tascan as president of games last year, is implementing a new strategy that will focus on four specific categories: party, narrative, kids, and mainstream games, the report added. The studio‚Äôs closure signals a realignment of resources toward this updated focus.Despite the shutdown, Boss Fight's two games, Netflix Stories and Squid Game: Unleashed, will continue to be available on the Netflix platform.","Boss Fight Entertainment's co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week.

How Nike‚Äôs new robot shoes will help users walk and run faster,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-nikes-new-robot-shoes-will-help-users-walk-and-run-faster/articleshow/124855979.cms,"How it will help users to walk or run faster



‚ÄúOur job is to dream big while keeping athletes at the centre. Project Amplify started with a single question: What if we could find a way to help athletes move faster and farther with less energy and a lot more fun? At its core, Project Amplify is about seamlessly adding a little more power to your stride. The fun comes from realising you can do more than you thought you could ‚Äî whatever ‚Äòmore‚Äô means to you.‚Äù





Nike has recently introduced Project Amplify, a new powered footwear system for running and walking. These new footwear items are designed to help athletes move faster and farther with reduced effort. The system is engineered to enhance natural lower leg and ankle movement, offering a significant boost to those who want to move. The company claims that this initiative aims to create new possibilities for running, jogging, and walking. The first version of the footwear system incorporates a lightweight motor, a drive belt, and a rechargeable cuff battery. These components integrate with a carbon fibre-plated running shoe, which can also be worn independently of the robotics system.According to Nike, this design is intended to enable everyday athletes to walk or run more frequently and for longer periods, potentially extending commutes or adding distance to runs. Project Amplify is one of four key technological advances Nike is revealing this month, alongside innovations in Air apparel, advanced cooling, and mind science.Nike claims its Project Amplify system is designed to make running, jogging, and walking easier and more enjoyable for athletes who typically run at a 10- to 12-minute-per-mile pace.Similar to how electric bikes assist cyclists, Project Amplify is designed to provide extra power for everyday movement, acting like an additional set of calf muscles rather than a performance booster for competitive runners.Developed with robotics partner Dephy, the project builds on data from Nike‚Äôs Sports Research Lab, where athletes of various skill levels reported that the system feels natural and makes uphill movement feel as effortless as running on flat ground. Some participants experienced improved running speeds, moving from a 12-minute mile to a 10-minute mile.The system has undergone years of testing both indoors and outdoors, with more than 400 athletes completing over 2.4 million steps ‚Äî roughly 12,000 laps of Nike‚Äôs 200-meter track ‚Äî across nine different hardware versions, each designed to refine specific aspects of the technology.In a blog post, Michael Donaghu, VP of Create The Future, Emerging Sport and Innovation at Nike, said:","Nike has introduced Project Amplify, a new powered footwear system for running and walking.

"YouTube removes 3,000 videos for spreading malware, report claims",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/youtube-removes-3000-videos-for-spreading-malware-report-claims/articleshow/124854083.cms,"What is YouTube Ghost Network and how it affected users







Check Point Research has discovered a large-scale malware distribution network operating through YouTube. This network, which relied on what appeared to be harmless tutorial videos, was reportedly spreading malicious software. The operation, dubbed the YouTube Ghost Network, used both compromised and fake YouTube accounts to distribute infostealers such as Rhadamanthys and Lumma. The malware was often disguised within videos offering cracked software or gaming cheats. Following a months-long investigation, Check Point Research reported more than 3,000 malicious videos to Google , leading to their removal and disrupting a significant malware distribution channel.According to the report, the YouTube Ghost Network operates as a coordinated web of fake or hijacked accounts rather than a random group of rogue uploads. These accounts are built to look credible and serve specific purposes within the operation.Some accounts focus on uploading tutorial-style videos that include links to download harmful files. Others publish community posts that share passwords and updated links.A third group interacts by posting positive comments and likes, helping the malicious videos appear genuine.This setup allows the network to expand rapidly and continue functioning even when some accounts are taken down, making the removal process ongoing and complicated.The campaign often used free or cracked software as bait, including Adobe Photoshop, FL Studio, Microsoft Office, and game hacks for titles like Roblox. Victims were guided to download an archive from platforms such as Dropbox, Google Drive, or MediaFire, to disable Windows Defender, and to install what appeared to be legitimate software.Instead, the files contained malware that stole credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and system information. The stolen data was then sent to servers whose addresses frequently changed to avoid detection.One YouTube channel with 129,000 subscribers shared a fake cracked version of Adobe Photoshop, gaining over 291,000 views and 1,000 likes. Meanwhile, another targeted cryptocurrency users, leading them to phishing pages on Google Sites that distributed Rhadamanthys Stealer.The attackers continuously updated links and malware versions, keeping the infection chain active even after some content was removed.Check Point Research monitored this operation for over a year, tracing thousands of connected accounts and campaigns. In collaboration with Google, the team helped remove more than 3,000 harmful videos, reducing one of the most persistent malware distribution channels on YouTube.","Check Point Research has discovered a large-scale malware distribution network operating through YouTube.
