UK launches first digital ID: Is it similar to India's Aadhaar? Full details of the plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-launches-first-digital-id-is-it-similar-to-indias-aadhaar-full-details-of-the-plan/articleshow/124630189.cms,"AI image used for representative purpose

Why UK government launched this plan



What is the use of ID?



How Veteran can use access digital IDs?



Is it similar to India?







The UK government launched the digital version of its ID scheme on Friday, intended for former members of the armed services.This ID will mean passports, driving licenses, national insurance cards, and many more being virtual, instead of—or as well as—being stored in a shoebox or under socks in a drawer, Sky News reported.The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.The govt claims the initiative is designed to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for those without status to secure employment.Ministers contend that the ability to obtain jobs is a primary attraction for migrants entering the UK unlawfully. Under the new system, employers will no longer be able to depend on National Insurance numbers—which currently serve as part of proof of the right to work—or on paper-based verification methods, BBC reported.""At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy—people sharing National Insurance numbers for example. The idea is that having a picture attached would make it—in theory—harder to abuse that system,"" a government spokesperson explained.The digital IDs, which will be app-based and stored on smartphones akin to the NHS App or digital bank cards, will contain information such as the holder's residency status, name, date of birth, nationality, and a photograph.Sir Keir, when announcing the scheme, stated: ""You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that.""From today, Friday 17 October, it will give ex-soldiers a seamless way to confirm their status in person and will include information already featured on their physical card with the security features that protect their personal information.Ministers hope the digital veteran card will show how the technology works and quash public concerns about privacy and security.Veterans will now be able to hold their credentials in a smartphone app called Gov.uk One Login. The govt had previously announced that digital credentials, including the veteran card, would be stored in an app named Gov.uk Wallet. It now states it will “transition to talking about [One Login] as the Gov.uk Wallet” as more govt-issued credentials become available digitally. The credential will be stored under encryption in the app, similar to how a train or concert ticket is held in an Apple or Google wallet, The Guardian reported.Verification using face ID or a fingerprint will be required to access it, and the govt claims it is safer than physical IDs. Another version of the credential will be held by the Ministry of Defence, and as more IDs are added, the information will remain with each issuer and in the citizens’ app, ensuring there is no central database of all ID data, thereby avoiding what some have feared could be a “honeypot for hackers”.India has well established digital ID system. India’s digital ID system, Aadhaar, is significantly larger and more detailed than the UK’s planned system.New Delhi stores citizens’ fingerprints, eye scans, photos, home addresses and phone numbers, with the system processing approximately 80 million authentications daily.Under Aadhaar, every Indian citizen receives a 12-digit number intended to replace numerous paper documents. All adults and children over the age of five must provide biometric information. The system verifies identities for activities such as opening bank accounts or applying for new SIM cards. It also aimed to streamline the disbursement of govt benefits, providing holders with instant proof of identity and access to basic services.Aadhaar and UK's digital ID seems to be same.India also have other apps like DigiLocker, where you can store all the important documents like Aadhar Card, Pan card, driving license digitally at one place, Digi Yatra and many more.The UK's digital ID seems to be following the similar model of India. Like DigiLocker, UK is introducing Gov.UK Wallet. Few days ago, UK PM Keir Starmer made his first trip to India and hailed India’s ID system as a “massive success”.During his trade-centric visit to Mumbai, Starmer also met with Nandan Nilekani, co-founder and chair of Indian tech services group Infosys, who led the govt body responsible for delivering the ID database more than a decade ago.",The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.

Sony PlayStation Network experienced a temporary outage earlier today, affecting thousands of users across the United States. Reports on DownDetector, a platform that tracks online service disruptions, indicated that over 11,000 users faced issues, primarily related to server connectivity. Users in the United States received ‘service busy’ message while accessing the platform. Problems were also detected with logging in and in carrying out PNS-related social media activities.Now, according to PlayStation Network Service Status, all services have now been restored. “All services are up and running,” the status page reads, including account management, gaming and social and PlayStation Store.As of now, there is no official statement from Sony about what caused the outage.The outage, which lasted for roughly an hour, impacted users in major cities including New York, Chicago, Washington, Atlanta, and Tampa. Many players reported problems logging in and using PlayStation Network’s social features during the downtime.Expressing frustration, one user wrote in the comment section of Downdetector: “Is it even worth it? Is it even worth it to wake up, eat, go to work, eat, sleep, repeat, for the rest of our lives? There's gotta be more to life than this. Surely we aren't supposed to be here to work to make other people rich”.Sony has since restored the network, and users can now access their accounts, play games, and use online services as normal.

“Your ability to manage a hybrid team of human and AI resources will play an essential role in the success of the company’s employees.""

4 tips Marco Argenti shared with Goldman Sachs' employees



“get creative with AI, posing provocative, non-obvious questions.”

“While AI excels at refurbishing existing knowledge its true creative potential is unlocked by human curiosity,""

“The expert will curate a personal toolkit of models and assistants and know[s] which one to deploy for which task,"" he explained

“plausible-sounding errors.”

“A blend of deep knowledge and a detective’s scepticism,”





Goldman Sachs chief information officer (CIO) Marco Argenti believes professionals can succeed in the AI-driven workplace by focusing on collaboration and questioning rather than competing with machines. In a recent company Briefings newsletter (as seen by Fortune), Argenti outlined four strategies on how employees canas autonomous systems take on tasks previously reserved for humans. Argenti's advice centres on adapting to the AI transition by learning how to conduct, question, and collaborate with the new technology. This approach is intended to help professionals thrive as AI reshapes workplaces globally. In the newsletter, Argenti wrote:Argenti suggests that today’s professionals need to shift from simply executing tasks to coordinating them. Success, he explains, will depend less on individual output, such as writing code or performing analysis and more on managing agile teams composed of both human and AI contributors. Effective leadership will involve delegating, coordinating, and integrating their work to achieve outcomes that neither could reach alone.According to Argenti, curiosity is one of the most valuable human abilities in an AI-driven world. He encourages employees toWhile AI systems are strong at processing existing information, they rely on human curiosity to spark new ideas. By asking imaginative, unconventional questions, people can help AI move beyond familiar patterns and reveal deeper insights.Argenti wrote.Argenti also recommends that professionals use a mix of AI tools tailored to specific tasks rather than relying on a single platform. No one model performs best in every situation, he notes. The advantage lies in understanding which tools are most effective for particular purposes, such as data analysis, writing, or coding and combining them into a personalised digital toolkit.Argenti further warns that even advanced AI systems can generateAs these tools become more integrated into work processes, checking their accuracy will require domain expertise and careful evaluation.he writes, will help distinguish reliable insights from misleading ones.Argenti concludes that AI is not replacing human ability but changing how it is defined. The future, he says, will favour those who combine technical understanding with creativity, critical thinking, and leadership qualities that remain uniquely human.","Goldman Sachs CIO Marco Argenti outlines four strategies on how employees can succeed in the AI-driven workplace.

"Milestone for AI in science: Google AI generates cancer hypothesis later validated by scientists, says Sundar Pichai",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/milestone-for-ai-in-science-google-ai-generates-cancer-hypothesis-later-validated-by-scientists-says-sundar-pichai/articleshow/124599530.cms,"

How Google AI is decoding cancer through cellular language



Discovery of a potential cancer therapy pathway



Transforming scientific discovery



Open access for global collaboration





In a significant development for AI in biomedical research, Google ’s C2S-Scale 27B foundation model, developed in collaboration with Yale University and based on the Gemma framework, has successfully generated a novel hypothesis about cancer cell behaviour. This hypothesis was later experimentally validated in living human cells, marking an important step forward in the integration of artificial intelligence with laboratory science.Google CEO Sundar Pichai hailed the development as a major advance in the partnership between AI and laboratory science. He emphasised that the discovery could guide future preclinical and clinical research, potentially revealing new pathways for cancer therapy.At the core of this achievement is the C2S-Scale 27B model’s exceptional capacity to ""understand"" biology. The AI system was trained on over one billion single-cell profiles and transforms raw molecular data into what researchers call “cell sentences.” With this approach, the AI can interpret cellular communication and context, essentially learning the “language” of cells.As biotech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson explained, the model “listened” to what cells were signalling and produced a hypothesis that real biological experiments later confirmed.This fluency in cellular patterns marks a turning point for AI’s role in biomedical discovery, enabling it to reason about complex systems and propose new ideas rather than simply summarising existing knowledge.The C2S-Scale 27B model produced a hypothesis suggesting that the drug silmitasertib could significantly boost antigen presentation in cancer cells by almost 50% under conditions of low interferon. Antigen presentation is the process by which tumour cells display fragments of abnormal proteins on their surface, signalling the immune system to recognise and attack them. By enhancing this mechanism, silmitasertib could make previously “invisible” tumours detectable to immune cells, strengthening the body’s own ability to fight cancer.Experiments conducted in human cell models confirmed the AI’s prediction. This finding is particularly promising for tackling “cold tumours,” a type of cancer known for bypassing immune detection and resisting conventional therapies. If these results are validated in further preclinical and clinical studies, they could open the door to new immunotherapy approaches, offering fresh hope for patients with cancers that are notoriously difficult to treat.This milestone represents a turning point in how AI can contribute to medical research. Rather than merely analysing existing datasets, AI systems like C2S-Scale 27B are now capable of generating entirely new scientific hypotheses, bridging the gap between computational prediction and experimental validation. Researchers emphasise that extensive preclinical and clinical testing is still essential before these AI-driven insights can translate into viable treatments for patients.Even so, this achievement demonstrates the transformative potential of AI as a true partner in science, capable of accelerating discovery, sparking innovation, and guiding research in ways that were previously unimaginable.In an effort to democratise cutting-edge biomedical research, Google has made the C2S-Scale model publicly available on platforms such as Hugging Face and GitHub. This transparency allows scientists worldwide to explore the model’s capabilities, test its predictions, and build upon its foundation.","Google’s C2S-Scale 27B foundation model has successfully generated a novel hypothesis about cancer cell behaviour.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Who is Niklas Elmehed: The man behind the iconic illustrations of the 2025 Nobel laureates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/who-is-niklas-elmehed-the-man-behind-the-iconic-illustrations-of-the-2025-nobel-laureates/articleshow/124624619.cms,"Niklas Elmehed’s journey to the Nobel laureates illustrations



Behind the scenes





When the world tunes in every October to see the latest Nobel Prize winners , the first images that greet audiences are not photographs but striking gold-and-black portraits. Behind these instantly recognisable illustrations is Niklas Elmehed, a Stockholm-based visual artist and Art Director at Nobel Media AB. Known for combining classical portraiture with modern illustration, Elmehed has been creating the official portraits of laureates since 2012, turning the announcement of the world’s most prestigious awards into a visual spectacle. Working under strict confidentiality, he completes each hand-painted portrait within hours of learning the winners’ names, ensuring the images reach a global audience almost instantly.Elmehed studied fine arts in Sweden and brings extensive experience in digital and print design. His work spans journalism, history, and fine art, capturing the achievements of leading scientists, writers, and peace advocates in a single, iconic image. As Art Director at Nobel Media AB, he oversees all visual content for Nobel announcements, blending precision, storytelling, and aesthetic appeal to create portraits that convey both dignity and immediacy.Before Elmehed, Nobel laureate announcements often relied on low-quality photographs sourced from institutional websites. He introduced hand-painted portraits with black outlines on a white background, accentuated by shimmering gold foil. This design, formalised during the Nobel Prize’s 2017 graphical rebranding, adds a timeless quality and a sense of prestige, symbolising the legacy of the Nobel tradition while giving each laureate a unique visual identity.Secrecy is a key part of Elmehed’s process. He is among the very few outside the Nobel committees to learn winners’ names in advance. Working under tight deadlines, he paints rapidly without compromising detail or quality. His portraits are completed just in time for the announcements, allowing media outlets worldwide to immediately share the iconic images alongside the news.In 2025, Elmehed unveiled “The Golden Wall”, exhibiting all Nobel portraits of the year at Nobel headquarters in Stockholm. This year’s portraits, including Medicine laureates Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi, were shared across official Nobel social media platforms. Beyond the Nobel Prize, Elmehed has showcased his work internationally, from TEDxPatras 2025, where he discussed the storytelling power of faces, to a live painting performance at the Nordic Pavilion of World Expo 2025 in Osaka.For Elmehed, each portrait is more than art; it is a form of visual storytelling. He aims to produce works that reflect the immediacy of breaking news while immortalising laureates with elegance and clarity. His goal is to give each portrait a strong and unique visual impression, capturing the world’s foremost minds in a style that is instantly recognisable and timeless.","Niklas Elmehed is a Stockholm-based visual artist and Art Director at Nobel Media AB.

UAE education reform 2025-26: Schools to roll-out diagnostic assessments and new evaluation methods,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-education-reform-2025-26-schools-to-roll-out-diagnostic-assessments-and-new-evaluation-methods/articleshow/124667036.cms,"UAE launches new diagnostic assessments in schools to track student progress, personalise learning, and bridge performance gaps early on / AI-generated illustration

What are these diagnostic assessments and why now?

How the assessments will work: Timing, subjects and implementation

What it means for students, parents and teachers

Challenges and what to watch for





UAE schools are stepping into the new academic year with a smarter approach to learning, introducing diagnostic assessments that spot students’ strengths and weaknesses early on. Starting this term, the Ministry of Education will roll out the new system across public schools, aiming to close learning gaps before they grow and help teachers tailor lessons to every child’s needs.Starting the 2025-26 academic year, schools across the Ministry of Education – UAE will introduce new diagnostic assessments early in the term, designed to identify learning gaps and support targeted teaching. These assessments will help teachers and schools understand each child’s strengths and weaknesses from the outset, rather than waiting until end-term exams.This move comes amid broader education reforms in the UAE, including the rollout of an AI curriculum and revised assessment policy.The diagnostic assessments will take place during the early weeks of the term, across key subjects such as Arabic, English and Mathematics for core grades (4-11) in public schools. For example, the first phase of a standardised proficiency test covers 26,000 students in Grades 4–11.Additionally, the exam schedule is re-structured: centralised tests now occur only in the first and third semesters, while the second semester moves to school-based assessments. The aim: teachers get early feedback, adapt teaching, and support students before gaps widen.For students, the change means less waiting and more support. Teachers will receive data early on to tailor lessons and interventions. Parents will have clearer insight into how their child is performing from the start. Schools gain a data-driven foundation to allocate resources and target help where it’s most needed. For teachers, this means working with richer feedback and adjusting lesson pacing and methods. Schools say diagnostic checks help them “identify learning gaps and provide tailored support before the next phase.”For the system, it signals a shift from high-stakes, end-of-term judgments to ongoing, formative evaluation, aimed at deeper learning rather than rote memorisation.While the initiative is promising, success depends on consistent implementation. Schools will need training, reliable data systems, and clarity around how the diagnostic results are used. Teachers may need professional development to interpret the data and act on it effectively. The Ministry has already rolled out training programmes for thousands of educators ahead of the year. There is also a need to ensure equity: private and public schools alike must have access and capacity for these assessments. Monitoring how the data translates into real improvement will be key.With the launch of early diagnostic assessments in the UAE’s 2025-26 school year, the education system is moving from reactive to proactive. By spotting learning gaps at the start, supporting students from day one and giving teachers better tools, the country hopes to raise outcomes, reduce pressure and build a foundation for future-ready learning.","UAE schools are introducing diagnostic assessments that spot students’ strengths and weaknesses early on.

The aim is to avoid confusion and make sure everyone knows their rights and responsibilities. This guidance applies to all private sector workers across the UAE.These clarifications make it easier for workers to know exactly what they are entitled to, whether it’s pay, overtime, or leave. Employers are also guided to follow the law, which reduces disputes and creates a fairer, more predictable work environment. Employees can also file complaints or seek guidance through the MoHRE app, hotline, or website if needed.By clearly clarifying working hours, fair wages, and updated annual leave rules, the UAE ensures consistent fair treatment and greater transparency in the dynamic private sector. Workers now have renewed confidence in their legal rights, while responsible employers have clear guidance to maintain a productive and fully compliant workplace.

Explained: How New York’s rich and famous are panicking about Zohran Mamdani,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explained-how-new-yorks-rich-and-famous-are-panicking-about-zohran-mamdani/articleshow/124668312.cms,"NYC Mayoral Debate Heats Up: Watch Mamdani & Cuomo’s Fiery Clash Over Hamas, Islamophobia &…

The Fear: “How did this happen?”



The Rage: “How dare he?”

The Shock: “This wasn’t supposed to happen”

The Grudging Acceptance: “Maybe the guillotine isn’t coming”



The Big picture





There’s a special kind of panic that only the ultra-rich can experience — the kind that hits when they realise the world they built, the one with helicopter rides to the Hamptons, $50,000-a-year pre-schools, and mayoral candidates who take their calls, might be slipping away. And right now, that panic has a name: Zohran Mamdani In the Pilates studios of the Upper East Side and the wine-soaked dinner tables of Tribeca, he’s become an existential threat disguised as a 33-year-old socialist. The man from Queens who talks about free buses and rent freezes is leading the mayoral race — and Manhattan’s wealthiest residents are losing their collective cool.The very people who believed they ran New York — the hedge fund billionaires, the podcasting wives, the real estate tycoons — are suddenly discovering their influence isn’t what it used to be. They’ve tried everything: whispered deals to clear the field for a centrist saviour, million-dollar donations to anti-Mamdani PACs, desperate strategy sessions over caviar. But Mamdani’s campaign, fuelled by a younger, angrier, and poorer electorate, is steamrolling their efforts.The disbelief is almost comical. Some donors admit that they’d rather have a deeply unpopular Cuomo in office because, by comparison, he looks like Winston Churchill.Others confess they never realised how much resentment was bubbling beneath the surface until Mamdani’s primary victory slapped them awake. For a class used to shaping reality with money and access, it’s like watching gravity stop working.Mamdani hasn’t just challenged New York’s elite — he’s mocked them. One campaign ad, featuring an actor lampooning rich people for complaining about socialism while eating lobster, ricocheted through Manhattan’s wealthiest ZIP codes. The reaction? Equal parts outrage and reluctant admiration. Many of the city’s power brokers are furious that they’re being openly caricatured, but they’re also unsettled by how effective the message has been.It’s not just politics anymore — it’s cultural warfare. The private school crowd is now playing “what if” scenarios over lunch: What if taxes go up? What if crime returns? What if we move to Miami, or Israel, or at least our second homes in Bedford? Most of them admit, behind closed doors, that they’ll probably stay put. But the very fact that they’re asking those questions reveals a deeper fear — that they’re no longer in control of the script.For decades, New York’s elite operated under a simple assumption: that money and influence could keep radical politics at bay. Mamdani has shattered that illusion. His campaign has built a coalition that isn’t swayed by threats of capital flight or lectures about how “job creators” keep the city afloat. These are voters who don’t care if billionaires threaten to decamp to Florida — because they were never invited to the billionaire parties in the first place.Even Mamdani’s nods to moderation — trimming the city bureaucracy, using tech in schools — haven’t eased their anxiety. Free buses and childcare might sound utopian to working-class New Yorkers, but they’re meaningless to people who spend more on their dog walkers than most families spend on rent. The disconnect is profound, and it’s making the city’s elite realise how out of touch they’ve become.Some in the 1% are slowly talking themselves down from the ledge. A few believe Mamdani might keep the current police commissioner, which would soothe Wall Street’s nerves. Others are even cheering him on, cynically betting that a socialist mayor will cause such chaos that voters will swing hard to the right in the next election. And then there are those quietly making contingency plans: more time in Europe, more weeks in the Hamptons, maybe a pied-à-terre in Rome — just in case.The panic isn’t about policies anymore. It’s about power. Mamdani represents the first serious threat to New York’s elite since the Gilded Age — a reminder that political gravity still pulls downward, and that wealth alone can’t guarantee control. One retired banker summed it up with weary resignation: it’s not as if the guillotine is being rolled into Central Park. But for a class used to dictating the terms of civic life, even the hint of losing their grip feels like a revolution.This is what class anxiety looks like in 2025: Pilates instructors gossiping about socialism, billionaires plotting over pasta, and Manhattan’s most powerful people asking each other if they should flee before the buses become free. Mamdani hasn’t even won yet, and he’s already forcing the city’s ruling class to confront an uncomfortable truth — that their era of uncontested dominance might be ending.And that, more than any policy or promise, is what’s keeping them awake at night.","Zohran Mamdani is leading the mayoral race and Manhattan’s wealthiest residents are losing their collective cool.

Crowded areas require attention to personal safety. Families with children should stay alert, especially near fireworks zones or food stalls. Respect cultural and religious diversity:



The spirit of Diwali should be one of inclusivity, not inconvenience. Any public celebrations should aim to bring people together rather than create noise or disruptions.





As of 2025, Dubai’s population has crossed seven million, and nearly two million Indian expatriates make up the city’s largest and most close-knit community. For them, Diwali is far more than a festive occasion — it’s a vital cultural anchor in a city defined by ambition and relentless pace.Every year, Dubai lights up with Diwali celebrations that span the entire spectrum: spectacular public events with government-approved fireworks and laser shows, elaborate displays in shopping malls and hotels, and intimate gatherings across Indian residential hubs such as Bur Dubai, Karama, and Discovery Gardens.But behind the glow lies a framework of order. Dubai’s strict regulations govern everything from firecracker use and event permits to public safety and crowd control.The big question every Diwali celebrant asks is simple: Are fireworks banned in Dubai? The answer is both yes and no. While private use, sale, and possession of fireworks are strictly prohibited, licensed and government-approved venues are permitted to hold official pyrotechnic displays.This means fireworks can light up the sky, but only where authorities have given explicit permission. Illegal fireworks, whether set off in residential areas or sold without a license, are treated as explosives under UAE law.Penalties include up to 3 months imprisonment or a fine of up to AED 5,000 for selling, using, or distributing fireworks. Additionally, parents can be held legally accountable if minors are involved in illegal fireworks use.Ahead of Diwali, authorities conduct rigorous enforcement campaigns, seizing illegal fireworks to prevent unsafe neighborhood celebrations. Residents are encouraged to report any suspected illegal activity through the Dubai Police app or by calling 901.For those legitimately aiming to host fireworks displays, securing a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority is strictly mandatory. However, this legal option is limited to licensed businesses only, specifically for entertainment purposes—not individual residents. The simple application process is straightforward, involving online registration, instant approval upon payment, and a small fee structure that includes AED 2,000 plus minor administrative and processing charges.In essence, fireworks in Dubai are a privilege reserved for official, regulated events. This tight framework reflects the city’s commitment to safety, order, and respect for its diverse population during Diwali.So, where can you dive into the Diwali fun and catch dazzling fireworks lighting up the Dubai sky? The city has confirmed several key spots where fireworks displays and vibrant festivities will take place. These government-approved events are free and open to everyone, offering fantastic opportunities to engage with the celebrations and enjoy the festival’s sparkle.The authorized fireworks schedule for Diwali 2025 is as follows:Visitors should plan to arrive early given the expected large crowds. Dubai Police and the Department of Economy and Tourism (DET) actively monitor these venues to maintain safety and crowd control.But Diwali in Dubai extends beyond fireworks. Several key locations offer vibrant cultural experiences throughout the festival:The waterfront transforms into a cultural Diwali village with traditional décor, floating diyas, heritage market stalls, and live performances as part of the immersive Noor Festival experience from October 17–19.The Indian Pavilion comes alive with cultural dance shows, handicrafts, vibrant décor, and street food. Fireworks light up the sky on select nights, making it a festive hotspot for all ages.Home to the spectacular IMAGINE light and fountain show synced to Bollywood hits, the mall also features Diwali-themed shopping deals, Indian food pop-ups, and family-friendly entertainment across the promenade.Expect Diwali-themed light projections on the world’s tallest tower and musical performances at the Dubai Fountain, offering dramatic visuals and ideal photo backdrops for visitors and residents alike.These buzzing neighbourhoods are a sensory overload of lights, music, and colour. Streets overflow with sweet shops, festive markets, traditional attire, and last-minute Diwali shopping well into the night.Together, these venues reflect the city’s vibrant, multicultural embrace of Diwali, catering to families, expatriates, tourists, and long-term residents alike.Among the many vibrant Diwali festivities across the city, one stands out as the official, government-backed centerpiece: Noor: Festival of Lights, running from October 17–19 at Souk Al Seef. Organized by the Dubai Festivals and Retail Establishment (DFRE) under the Department of Economy and Tourism (DET), in partnership with the Indian Consulate and Teamwork Arts, this spectacular flagship event transforms the historic waterfront into a lively cultural Diwali village filled with music, art, and community spirit.Highlights include:“Noor,” meaning “light” in Arabic, embodies the spirit of Diwali, symbolizing unity, renewal, and togetherness. Organizers present it as a “home away from home” for Dubai’s Indian community and a celebration that bridges cultures within the city’s diverse fabric.As the city comes alive with vibrant lights, music, and festive celebration, there's also a growing reminder: Diwali in Dubai isn’t just about enjoying the spectacular spectacle—it’s about doing so responsibly. In a place as culturally diverse and densely populated as this, festivities should uplift the wider community experience, not disrupt it. Authorities and civic leaders are strongly urging residents to be mindful, respectful, and clean as they actively take part in the celebrations.Dubai’s law enforcement and safety departments will be closely monitoring public areas during Diwali. Residents are encouraged to enjoy all official events but are reminded that any illegal or inconsiderate behavior will be met with firm action.","Dubai’s confirmed Diwali fireworks will take place at Al Seef on October 17 and Global Village on October 18, 19, 24, and 25.

Opening in Abu Dhabi’s Saadiyat Cultural District, the Zayed National Museum will offer a comprehensive and immersive journey through the history of the United Arab Emirates. Honouring the legacy of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the museum is set to become a cultural cornerstone reflecting the UAE’s past, present and aspirations for the future.Set to welcome visitors on December 3, 2025, the Zayed National Museum will stand as the official national museum of the United Arab Emirates. Located in the Saadiyat Cultural District in Abu Dhabi, it is dedicated to the life, vision, and values of the UAE’s Founding Father, the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.Developed under the Department of Culture and Tourism – Abu Dhabi, the museum is envisioned as a space where history, culture and innovation converge. Mohamed Khalifa Al Mubarak, Chairman of the department, described it as a living institution that tells “the story of our land, our people, and our heritage” in a way that is inclusive, evolving, and grounded in knowledge and education — values Sheikh Zayed upheld throughout his life.The opening date — December 3 — is symbolic, falling just before UAE National Day, further emphasising its role as a national tribute.According to an official post by the Abu Dhabi Media Office, the launch also marks the city’s strengthened position as a global hub for cultural dialogue and education.The museum was designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Lord Norman Foster of Foster + Partners. The structure reflects both modern sustainability practices and deep cultural roots. One of its most distinctive features is five towering steel structures designed to resemble falcon wings in flight, symbolising falconry’s importance in Emirati tradition.Spanning a carefully curated pathway, the museum experience begins at Al Masar Garden, a 600-metre landscaped route starting from the Saadiyat coastline. It connects the Louvre Abu Dhabi to the Zayed National Museum and the upcoming Natural History Museum Abu Dhabi.The garden features carefully selected native plants from desert, oasis, and urban environments, along with a fully functional falaj irrigation system, artistic sculptures, multisensory installations, and a detailed timeline highlighting Sheikh Zayed’s remarkable life and key milestones in UAE history. This thoughtfully designed outdoor gallery sets the tone for the immersive historical journey that continues seamlessly inside.Inside, the museum will showcase over 3,000 artefacts, of which 1,500 will be on display. These objects were chosen for their ability to convey the stories of the land and its people, from ancient times to the modern UAE.Together, these galleries form a chronological, thematic, and sensory-rich narrative of the UAE's past, guided by Sheikh Zayed’s enduring influence.To mark the inauguration, a comprehensive programme of performances, tours, workshops, and interactive activities will offer visitors a wide range of experiences. The museum aims to appeal to all generations, encouraging both discovery and engagement with the country's story.On-site dining options will include:Ticketing details have been announced:The Zayed National Museum will join a growing cluster of world-class institutions within the Saadiyat Cultural District, alongside:As a central pillar in this cultural hub, the museum represents not just a proud tribute to the past but also a vision for the UAE’s cultural future — a place of dialogue, education, and creative shared heritage.With its doors set to open on December 3, 2025, the Zayed National Museum is poised to become one of the most important and significant cultural institutions in the region, offering a deeply rooted yet forward-looking innovative perspective on the story of the United Arab Emirates.","The Zayed National Museum will open on December 3, 2025.

Dubai deploys fully autonomous AI traffic system to detect road violations in real time without human input,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-deploys-fully-autonomous-ai-traffic-system-to-detect-road-violations-in-real-time-without-human-input/articleshow/124596890.cms,"Dubai unveils Intelligent Traffic System (ITS) at GITEX Global 2025, an AI traffic system automating traffic surveillance. Image: X

A smarter approach to road safety

Real time detection of five critical violations

Not wearing a seatbelt – Detects whether drivers and passengers are properly restrained. Using a mobile phone while driving – Monitors for illegal mobile phone usage during vehicle operation. Obstructing traffic flow – Flags unnecessary actions that impede smooth traffic movement. Stopping in the middle of the road without valid reason – Identifies vehicles halted inappropriately on roadways. Tailgating – Detects failure to maintain safe following distances between vehicles.

Instant updates and in-depth analytics

Supporting Dubai’s smart city goals





Dubai has introduced a fully autonomous Intelligent Traffic System (ITS), leveraging artificial intelligence and real-time video monitoring to identify and document major traffic violations instantly. Unveiled at GITEX Global 2025, the system aims to transform road safety enforcement and streamline traffic operations across the emirate through automation and smart data use.Dubai Police’s newly launched ITS operates without human intervention and is designed to detect traffic offenses as they happen. Built as a unified digital platform, the system incorporates live surveillance feeds and advanced data analytics to monitor driver behavior and flag violations.The ITS represents a significant shift in how traffic laws are enforced, moving routine tasks from field officers to an AI-driven system. According to Lieutenant Engineer Ahmad Al Hammadi, the automation of these responsibilities frees up police personnel for more strategic duties, ultimately improving operational efficiency and decision-making. He described the system as “smarter, fairer, and more efficient,” underlining its role in supporting Dubai’s broader vision to become a globally recognised smart and safe city.The Intelligent Traffic System is engineered to target five specific driver behaviors that have been identified as major threats to road safety:Each violation is captured in real time using AI-analyzed footage and immediately logged into the system with high accuracy.One of the system’s standout features is its ability to provide live updates on the number of vehicles being monitored and the violations recorded at any given moment. This constant stream of data gives authorities an up-to-date view of traffic compliance levels across the city.Beyond real-time monitoring, the ITS generates comprehensive statistical data on vehicle movement patterns. The analytics are broken down across different timeframes - hourly, daily, and yearly, allowing traffic planners to understand behavioral trends and optimize enforcement strategies accordingly.The statistical output is also crucial for improving emergency response capabilities by identifying congestion hotspots and predicting areas where quicker interventions may be necessary.The launch of the Intelligent Traffic System is in alignment with Dubai’s long-term objectives to enhance road safety and efficiency through digital transformation. By automating key aspects of traffic enforcement, the platform not only reduces the margin for human error but also introduces a fairer, more transparent and accountable mechanism for holding drivers responsible.As the system gradually scales and integrates further into city-wide operations, it is expected to serve as an effective model for other modern urban centers aiming to implement smart traffic governance through advanced technology.","Dubai Police’s newly launched ITS operates without human intervention and is designed to detect traffic offenses as they happen.

A vision endorsed at the highest level







The stadium: Fully air-conditioned, retractable pitch, and more

Location and long-term development: Zayed city and beyond









Commercial ecosystem: Integration with real estate and community infrastructure





If you’re curious about Abu Dhabi’s latest big sports project, here’s what you need to know: a brand-new, fully air-conditioned stadium is coming for Al Jazira Club. But this isn’t just a new home for the team—it’s designed to be a lively community hub, hosting events all year round. Located in Zayed City, this stadium reflects the UAE’s drive to take sports and public life to the next level.Earlier this month, on October 7, 2025, UAE President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan personally reviewed the design and master plan for the new Al Jazira Club Stadium. This event was more than ceremonial—it marked the public unveiling of a highly anticipated project intended to redefine Abu Dhabi’s sporting landscape.The stadium is being built under the direct supervision of His Highness Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Vice President, Deputy Prime Minister, and Chairman of the Presidential Court. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2026 and is projected to take three years, with completion expected in 2029.The new stadium isn’t just about football—it ties into the UAE’s bigger goals. It’s part of a national push to get young people more involved in sports, make public spaces more vibrant, and use sports as a key part of the country’s growth.It also fits into wider efforts to support innovation and aim for top-tier standards across the board.The upcoming stadium will have a base capacity of 24,000 seats, expandable to 30,000 to accommodate larger events. One of its standout features will be fully air-conditioned seating areas—a crucial consideration in the region’s climate. The stadium will also incorporate a retractable pitch, a dynamic design element that allows the playing surface to slide completely out of the arena when not in use. This ensures maximum flexibility for non-sporting events and maintenance.Additionally, the stadium complex will offer dedicated hospitality services for spectators. These will include premium zones, restaurants, and lounges designed not only for match days but also for year-round use. These venues will remain open outside event times, aiming to convert the facility into a community and lifestyle hub rather than a single-purpose sports venue.While no architectural renderings have been published by the club as of now, images from the October 7 review event show President Sheikh Mohamed examining detailed design plans—signaling that the project has entered a decisive phase of planning.The stadium is set to rise in Zayed City, a planned development in the southern part of Abu Dhabi that’s being shaped as a key urban centre for the future. The project isn’t just adding a sports venue—it’s expected to help drive growth and activity in the area.Once complete, the new stadium will become the new home of Al Jazira Club, replacing their long-time base at Mohammed bin Zayed Stadium, where the team has played since 1980. That stadium was expanded in 2009 to hold around 36,000 spectators, and it already includes air-conditioned stands. But this move signals a shift toward a more modern, flexible, and multi-purpose setup.And it’s not just about football. While Al Jazira competes in the UAE Pro League, the club is also active in volleyball, handball, and basketball. The new venue could support these sports too—positioning it as a broader home for top-tier sporting events across disciplines.Alongside the stadium build, Al Jazira Club is also thinking bigger—with plans that go beyond just sports. In September 2025, the club partnered with MAIR Group, a strategic investment company that focuses on grocery retail and commercial real estate.As part of the ambitious deal, Makani Real Estate, a prominent division of MAIR Group, has been granted 80,000 square metres of prime land right next to the new stadium site. The overarching plan? To transform that space into a fully integrated, modern commercial centre. Over time, it is expected to include entertainment venues, personal services, and essential healthcare facilities—essentially building an entire vibrant community around the stadium that is lively, connected, and thoughtfully designed for everyday urban life, providing residents with convenient access to all key amenities.","Al Jazira Club’s new stadium will feature a retractable pitch and fully air- conditioned seating for 24,000 spectators.

UAE leads the Gulf with remote weddings





Couples in Abu Dhabi can now get legally married with just a few taps on their phones, thanks to the innovative marriage service launched on the government’s TAMM app - all for Dh800 (approximately $217). The all-digital service enables couples anywhere in the world to complete their marriage legally through a secure online ceremony, marking a new milestone in the emirate’s drive for smart government services.The TAMM app, which consolidates over 1,100 government and private sector services onto a single platform, now offers this seamless marriage solution under the supervision of the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department. Through a WebEx video link, the couple, two witnesses, and a licensed officiant join the wedding ceremony virtually. Even guests can participate remotely, eliminating the need for physical presence anywhere in the UAE. For couples residing abroad, a power of attorney can represent them locally during the ceremony.Describing the feature as a matter of convenience, Hammad Alhammadi, executive director of customer care and happiness sector at TAMM, said, “Even if you visit Abu Dhabi, you are able to log into and transact on services through Tamm, and one of them will be the marriage contract,” and added, “It's getting a lot of momentum right now.Maybe [it loses the romance] if you're getting married, but can also be very helpful. ”Couples seeking attested marriage certificates can pay an additional Dh300 for the app to automatically attest the document through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and deliver a secure digital version. Instead of traditional physical stamps, the marriage certificate now carries a UAE Pass digital signature. The entire streamlined process from document submission to ceremony scheduling can be completed within 24 hours if couples book an appointment in advance and have all necessary paperwork.To safeguard legal compliance and prevent underage or forced marriages, the marriage service is integrated with the UAE Pass and Emirates ID systems, verifying applicant identities and eligibility.Mohamed Al Askar, who heads the Abu Dhabi government TAMM application, told AFP at the Dubai-based Gitex Global 2025 tech fair: ""It's open to everyone. Whoever wants to get married in Abu Dhabi, regardless of their nationality, can get the service online. People can go online, they can do the whole transaction without the need to go to any physical place. We are among the first to do that.""The UAE stands out as the only Gulf nation allowing foreigners to enter into non-religious marriages, and this latest initiative reaffirms Abu Dhabi’s leadership in digital public services. Inspired by preliminary online marriage services introduced during the Covid-19 pandemic and modeled on innovations from countries like Ukraine, Abu Dhabi’s digital wedding experience is among the world’s first to facilitate fully remote, cross-border civil marriages.Lauding the transformative nature of TAMM AutoGov, His Excellency Ahmed Tamim Hisham Al Kuttab, Chairman of the Department of Government Enablement - Abu Dhabi, told Timeout: “The launch of TAMM AutoGov is truly transformative, redefining what government means in people’s lives. Here, government is no longer reactive. It’s a partner that is intelligent, human-centered, and present at the moments that matter most. With the world’s first transactional AI public servant, Abu Dhabi is showing the world what anticipatory government looks like.”In essence, Abu Dhabi’s new online marriage service through the TAMM app offers couples a modern, convenient, fully secure, and legally recognized way to wed quickly—whether they’re residents, citizens, or overseas, anywhere globally, with full government backing, official support, and digital certification that embraces the future of smart, innovative governance while ensuring a seamless and enjoyable experience for users.",Abu Dhabi launches online wedding service via TAMM app. All-digital service enables couples anywhere in the world to complete their marriage legally through a secure online ceremony.

UAE: Too good to be true? Sharjah Police warn of ‘dream car’ scams targeting buyers and sellers online,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-too-good-to-be-true-sharjah-police-warn-of-dream-car-scams-targeting-buyers-and-sellers-online/articleshow/124573542.cms,"Scammers use professional car photos and ultra-low prices, along with pressure tactics like “many are interested,” to trick buyers into paying deposits before vanishing/ Representative Image

How the scam works: A ""dream car"" that disappears after the deposit

A Tempting Dream – A product that feels out of reach is suddenly available at an irresistible price;

A Symbolic Price – So low it suspends disbelief and encourages rapid action;

Flashy Photos – Professional visuals add legitimacy to the fake listing.

Sellers also targeted: Fake payments and forged documents used to steal vehicles

The real defence: Verification, caution, and critical thinking

For buyers:





View the vehicle in person before making any financial commitment;

Request and inspect ownership documents;

Verify the identity of the seller, including matching ID to vehicle registration;

Be cautious of suspiciously low prices, especially those paired with pressure tactics.

For sellers:





Do not release the vehicle until payment is confirmed and cleared in your bank account;

Treat all payment confirmations and receipts as suspect until verified with your bank;

Be wary of buyers using urgency or false documentation to push early handovers.

For all users:





Sharjah Police encourage anyone who encounters a suspicious listing or request to report it immediately by calling 80040, the designated hotline for such fraud cases.

Authorities take action: Public warnings and swift arrests





In a sharp warning to the public, Sharjah Police have exposed a rising wave of highly orchestrated online vehicle scams targeting both buyers and sellers. The frauds, which prey on emotions and override logical decision-making, have led to significant financial losses across the UAE. As part of their proactive response, Sharjah Police released an official awareness video cautioning residents to carefully verify every step and promptly report suspicious activity without delay.The fraudulent scheme typically begins on popular classified platforms or social media, where visually polished ads present luxury or desirable vehicles at prices far below market value. The low price point is not accidental—it is designed to sidestep skepticism and provoke emotional decisions.Victims report being lured by high-quality car images, quick responses from the ""seller,"" and urgent messaging claiming other buyers are interested. This pressure, often phrased as ""first to pay gets the car,"" manipulates urgency, pushing the buyer to act without verifying the offer.Once a deposit is transferred, communication ceases. Calls and messages go unanswered, and the advertisement vanishes. In nearly all cases, the car is non-existent, and the fraudster is unreachable.According to Sharjah Police, the scam is structured around a pattern of psychological triggers:Police stress that this tactic isn’t random—it’s a deliberate attempt to bypass logic and exploit emotional vulnerability. Victims aren’t just deceived; they’re manipulated into self-convincing belief.In a separate but connected criminal scheme, sellers of vehicles have also become victims. A criminal gang, recently apprehended by Sharjah Police, targeted private sellers through platforms where vehicles are listed for sale.The perpetrators would express interest, make an attractive offer, and follow up with a falsified payment receipt claiming that funds had been transferred and were awaiting deposit. Using forged identification and persuasive communication, the scammers would convince the seller to hand over the car, believing the payment was in progress.In reality, no money was ever transferred, and by the time the scam is uncovered, the vehicle is gone.This variation of the scam highlights how both buyers and sellers are vulnerable in digital transactions—particularly in unregulated online environments where identity and payment verification are minimal or entirely absent.To combat this rising threat, Sharjah Police are calling on the public to remain alert and follow essential verification steps before engaging in any online vehicle transactions.In response to the increasing frequency of these crimes, Sharjah Police have intensified public awareness campaigns, including the release of an official video outlining the key tactics scammers use. These efforts aim to educate the public about how modern frauds rely more on emotional manipulation than obvious deception.A senior police officer explained that many victims “failed to verify and didn’t ask”, emphasizing that excessive trust and lack of due diligence are the two main vulnerabilities exploited.Police have also acted swiftly in high-profile cases. In one instance, a criminal group running an online car scam was arrested within just 12 hours. This shows the authorities’ strong commitment to curbing economic crimes in the digital space.","Sharjah Police have exposed a rising wave of highly orchestrated online vehicle scams targeting both buyers and sellers.

Riyadh, get ready to sashay! The city’s biggest fashion week is about to turn up the heat with Vivienne Westwood and Stella McCartney, two style legends are set to headline the event, promising jaw-dropping designs, cultural fusion, and sustainable glamour like never before.Riyadh Fashion Week 2025 is not just another event on the fashion calendar; it's a bold statement. From October 16 to 21, the Saudi capital transforms into a sartorial playground, featuring over 30 runway shows, designer presentations, and citywide activations. This year's edition marks a significant milestone as it welcomes international fashion icons Vivienne Westwood and Stella McCartney to the Kingdom's fashion stage for the first time.The style revolution kicks off on October 16 with a show that's pure, electric fusion: the Middle Eastern runway debut of Vivienne Westwood.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.
