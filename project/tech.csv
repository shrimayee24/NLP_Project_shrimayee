Did Cardi B just dump Stefon Diggs? Rapper deletes all traces of NFL star after $12K-a-night castle romance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/did-cardi-b-just-dump-stefon-diggs-rapper-deletes-all-traces-of-nfl-star-after-12k-a-night-castle-romance/articleshow/122274384.cms,"Cardi B has removed all photos of Stefon Diggs from her Instagram (Getty Images)

Romantic getaway to a French castle makes headlines before social media shake-up

It seems Cardi B ’s whirlwind romance with New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs might be hitting a rocky patch — at least online. Barely a month after confirming their relationship through a series of intimate Instagram posts, fans were quick to notice that the Grammy-winning rapper has now scrubbed her page of all traces of Diggs.In early June, Cardi B had made her love public, posting affectionate clips of the couple and even joining Stefon Diggs at his fourth annual ""Diggs Day Camp"" at the University of Maryland. However, her sudden Instagram purge has sparked speculation that trouble may be brewing behind the scenes. Diggs, on the other hand, still has photos of Cardi up on his profile, adding further mystery to the sudden social media move.The timing of the Instagram deletion is curious, especially after reports that Diggs recently pulled out all the stops for a luxurious romantic retreat with Cardi. According to The Cut, the four-time Pro Bowl wide receiver rented the Château de Farcheville — a lavish medieval castle just outside Paris — for their private escape. The $12,000-per-night venue features everything from a music room to a wine cellar and spa, making it a fairytale getaway for the high-profile pair.The couple’s romance had been gradually going public since they were first linked back in October 2024. They were spotted celebrating Valentine’s Day together, and again at Madison Square Garden for the NBA Playoffs on May 25. But it wasn’t until Cardi B’s June Instagram posts that fans got official confirmation.While his offseason escapades have grabbed headlines, Stefon Diggs will soon need to turn his attention to football. After signing a $69 million, three-year deal with the Patriots in March, all eyes are on his upcoming partnership with rookie quarterback Drake Maye. Training camp opens July 23, and with expectations high, Diggs’ performance will be crucial in shaping the team’s 2025 season.Also Read: Tom Brady’s surprise wedding date isn’t a new flame—and Gisele Bündchen gives her full approval As for his relationship with Cardi B, it's still unclear whether the Instagram wipe signals a breakup or just a pause on public sharing.

Fans react to Stephen Curry’s luxurious mansion

Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry and his wife Ayesha Curry occasionally share joyful pictures of their family of six enjoying time together at home. They live in Atherton, Northern California — America’s most expensive neighborhood, which is conveniently close to where Stephen plays. Their $30 million mansion serves as the perfect abode, offering luxury while also cutting down his travel time to the court. Take a look.Stephen and Ayesha Curry have four children and need ample space for them to sleep and play. According to Hello! magazine, the property is located near the Lloyden Park neighborhood in Atherton. The area is so upscale that many people who work there cannot afford to live nearby due to skyrocketing land prices.The mansion boasts seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms, comfortably accommodating their family of six. This is a notable upgrade from their previous four-bedroom Malibu home, where they lived until 2021. The house features a large pool, with the mansion on one side and expansive green lawns on the other. There are also sprinklers and fountains for the kids to enjoy outdoors.Meanwhile, large glass doors and windows bring a sunny, airy vibe to the interiors.Inside the three-story home, they have a private movie theatre, a spacious dining area adjoining the kitchen for entertaining guests, and more. Since Stephen owns a whiskey brand, the house also includes a fully equipped bar for family and friends.When a picture of the house surfaced on Reddit , NBA fans were impressed by the lavish property. One user commented, “Nice. Well deserved.” Another wrote, “Think about it. That’s less than one year’s salary for him. What are you getting for your one year’s salary?” A third added, “PG&E and water bill must be insane.”One Redditor also remarked, “Only 7 bedrooms? I’m surprised. Actually, this isn’t extravagant for a man of Steph’s wealth. He has four children. That leaves two rooms for guests. Considering how close the entire Curry clan is and how often they gather, this is exactly what I would expect.”Also Read: Ayesha Curry credits Stephen Curry for her bikini bod shot, calls him “love of my life” Stephen is currently spending time with his family after suffering a hamstring injury during the NBA playoffs.

Whether one likes it or not, America was built by immigrants, the wretched masses that the Statue of Liberty inscription asks to welcome with open arms. From Albert Einstein to Elon Musk, immigrants made America a great country, and now it looks like they are making America great again (MAGA, as the slogan goes), and this time in artificial intelligence. America’s edge isn’t just its innovation, it's the global brainpower who has been giving an edge to the country for centuries. And nothing makes that clearer than the news out of Meta’s new Superintelligence Lab: 11 top AI researchers hired, and every single one of them is an immigrant.That’s right, not one US undergrad among them. These are elite engineers, model architects, and machine learning pioneers who began their academic journeys in India, China, South Africa, the UK, and Australia. They trained in America’s best labs, built some of the most advanced AI systems at OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic, and now they’ve been snapped up by Zuckerberg to build the next wave of intelligence. If you want to understand why the US leads the world in AI, you don’t need to look at GPUs or model benchmarks. Just look at the passports of the people writing the code.Immigrants have long been the silent engine of Silicon Valley. From coding at Google to architecting cloud infrastructure at Microsoft, they form the backbone of America’s biggest tech empires. A significant number of these engineers hail from India, whose talent pipeline has become essential to the innovation output of the U.S. tech sector. They don’t just fill jobs, they define the direction of the industry. Now, as AI becomes the next great technological frontier, these same minds are shaping the models, algorithms, and safety protocols that will govern its future. Meta’s new superintelligence team is just the latest proof that without immigration, there is no AI revolution.Previously at OpenAIMaster of Science (M.Sc.

While this abundance can lead to confusion, it's a byproduct of opportunity.

(The writer is a behavioural scientist, leadership coach and a relationship counsellor)





By: Chandra Shekhar VarmaWhen we were growing up, life offered limited choices. Career paths were straightforward. Entertainment had its boundaries. The lucky ones had a TV at home, but even for them, options were few.At 7.30pm, the only dilemma was whether to watch ‘Krishi Darshan’, a programme for farmers, or stare at the ceiling. Simpler? Yes. Less overwhelming? Definitely.Now imagine Gen Z. They’re not standing at a simple fork in the road; they’re at a full-blown traffic junction with 97 blinking signs. There are thousands of careers, dozens of passions, millions of opinions, and a strange algorithm constantly suggesting what to eat, wear, watch, or even feel. And ironically, it’s the older generation (us), the very people who built this multichoice world, who now say, “You kids are so confused these days”.But let’s be fair. Options aren’t the enemy. Confusion isn’t a flaw. It’s the byproduct of possibility. Real art lies not in avoiding choices but in learning how to choose wisely. Sometimes, you’ll choose the wrong option but that’s okay. In fact, it’s brilliant. Because failure isn’t a detour; it’s the actual syllabus.The jobs you quit, the friendships that faded, the courses you didn’t finish — they’re all part of your growth chart. It’s not wasted time; it is a character being carved. Just don’t hang on to the wrong choices, either by sulking over them or convincing yourself they deserve another chance.‘To be or not to be…’ when Shakespeare wrote those lines, he couldn’t have imagined an entire generation would ask themselves the same thing 20 times a day. Having options is a privilege. Indecisiveness is a burden.So, what should you do when you’re stuck at a crossroads?Take a pause. Step back from scrolling, opinions, and the buzz. Look beyond Instagram filters and viral success stories. Mute the noise for a bit. Listen to that quiet voice inside — the one that doesn’t scream but always knows.Make one decision. Not necessarily a perfect one, just a brave one, and walk that path. If you stumble, learn from it. Course-correct if needed. Remember, you’re not supposed to have it all figured out at 20. Or even at 30. Life isn’t a single choice. It’s a series of them. Each turn, each mistake, each restart adds up to the story only you can tell. And if you’re stuck, start eliminating. Sometimes, clarity doesn’t come from choosing. It comes from crossing things out.In a lighter vein…The next time you find yourself at a crossroads, don’t freeze. Flip a coin, if you must. Not to let chance decide, but to listen to your gut while the coin is in the air.","Growing up, previous generations faced limited choices, unlike Gen Z navigating a world of endless possibilities and overwhelming options.

India plans supersonic firepower upgrade: IAF eyes Israeli AIR LORA missile after Rampage success - details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/india-plans-supersonic-firepower-upgrade-iaf-eyes-israeli-air-lora-missile-after-rampage-success-details/articleshow/122268716.cms,"This is a representational image (Pic credit: Lexica)

High-value targeting with deep strike capability

Fire-and-forget system with mid-flight target update

Navigation, survivability, and all-weather capability

Interoperability and mission flexibility

NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force (IAF) is reportedly considering the acquisition of AIR LORA, an advanced air-launched ballistic missile developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), to significantly bolster its long-range strike capabilities.This potential procurement comes on the heels of the successful deployment of the Rampage missile during Operation Sindoor, where the IAF launched strikes on 11 Pakistani air bases. While Rampage offers a range of 250 kilometres and requires direct aircraft deployment, the AIR LORA missile provides a stand-off range of up to 400 kilometres, enabling precision strikes from a safer distance, beyond the reach of enemy air defence systems.Belonging to IAI's LORA missile family, AIR LORA is described as an extended-range, precise, massive, supersonic weapon. It is specially designed to neutralise high-value, well-defended targets such as airbases, command and control centres, naval vessels, and critical infrastructure.The missile can be launched from IAF platforms such as the Su-30MKI, with a launch weight of 1,600 kilograms. Once fired, AIR LORA travels at supersonic speeds, reaching its target within minutes.Its precision strike ability is marked by a Circular Error Probable (CEP) of less than 10 meters, ensuring minimal collateral damage.AIR LORA features a fire-and-forget design, requiring no further input from the launching aircraft after release. What sets it apart is its ability to update target coordinates mid-flight, allowing it to adapt to evolving battlefield dynamics and shifting targets in real time.According to IAI, ""AIR LORA addresses these operational challenges with unparalleled efficiency and precision.""The missile is equipped with GPS/INS navigation along with anti-jamming technology, ensuring accuracy even in electronic warfare environments where GPS signals may be compromised. It also boasts a seekerless design that employs steep-angle, high-speed attack profiles to increase survivability against air defences. AIR LORA is capable of operating in all-weather conditions.One of AIR LORA's standout features is its broad compatibility with various aircraft types, supporting both standalone and integrated configurations across Western and Eastern platforms. This means the missile can be quickly adopted without the need for extensive retraining or overhaul of existing systems.It also offers multiple warhead configurations, including blast fragmentation, general-purpose, and deep-penetration variants, making it suitable for a wide spectrum of tactical and strategic missions.","The Indian Air Force (IAF) is reportedly considering the acquisition of AIR LORA.

Renovating the world’s largest fountain: The hidden work behind Dubai’s iconic water show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/renovating-the-worlds-largest-fountain-the-hidden-work-behind-dubais-iconic-water-show/articleshow/122257332.cms,"The Dubai Fountain’s renovation upgrades its flooring, technology, and maintenance systems, with engineers and workers operating 24/7 across its 18-football-field-sized pool/ Image: Instagram

A Fountain Like No Other: The Scale of the Task



The Ongoing Renovation : A Major Overhaul



New Flooring System: The old concrete surface had occasional cracks, disrupting maintenance. Now, a durable waterproofing system is being installed, including a special primer and insulation designed to help with water retention.

Glowing Blue Tiles: These tiles, visible beneath the water from all angles around the lake, are not just visually striking but also functional, adding to the overall aesthetic and longevity of the structure.

Robotic Technology : A Fountain Powered by Machines



Choreography Bots: These robots control the movement of the water jets, ensuring they spray in perfect rhythm with the music.

Lighting Bots: These robots adjust the lighting, ensuring that the visual effects are perfectly in sync with the water's movements.

Fixed Water Jets: These jets spray water in harmony with the beats, adding another layer of coordination to the show.

Keeping Everything Clean: The Underwater Maintenance



A Temporary Pause, but the Show Goes On







The Dubai Fountain is known for its captivating performances, synchronized water jets, dazzling lights, and perfectly timed music. As the world’s largest choreographed fountain, it draws millions of visitors each year to the heart of Downtown Dubai. But what does it really take to maintain and renovate this iconic spectacle? From intricate underwater technology to the massive team of engineers and robots working tirelessly, the work behind maintaining and renovating the Dubai Fountain never stops. It goes on around the clock, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, ensuring this iconic water show continues to dazzle visitors long into the future. Here’s a closer look at the monumental effort behind the scenes.The Dubai Fountain isn’t just big; it’s enormous. The fountain stretches over an area as large as 18 football fields. Beneath its shimmering surface lies a sophisticated network of water jets, robotic arms, and lighting systems, all working in perfect harmony to create the mesmerizing shows that have made it famous.Given its sheer size, it's no surprise that keeping the fountain in top shape requires a lot of work. In fact, hundreds of engineers and technicians are involved in maintaining the fountain, handling everything from daily upkeep to major renovations.In April 2025, the fountain was temporarily shut down for a five-month renovation to improve its performance, aesthetics, and longevity. The project, confirmed by the fountain’s developer Emaar, involves an array of upgrades. Though the renovation has taken the fountain offline, the work behind it will ensure that the Dubai Fountain continues to dazzle for years to come.Key improvements include:These changes aren't just about making the fountain look better, they aim to ensure that the fountain runs smoothly and efficiently for years to come.One of the most fascinating aspects of the Dubai Fountain is the extensive use of robotic technology. From choreography bots that control the movement of water to lighting bots that match visual effects with the rhythm of the music, these robots play a crucial role in every performance. In fact, the programming of a single song for the fountain can take several weeks, as multiple robotic systems must be synchronized to create the perfect dance of water and light.The renovation also involves upgrading the technology behind these systems to improve precision and reduce the time it takes to program a new performance. As a result, the fountain will continue to deliver unforgettable shows, with even better choreography and lighting.Beneath the water's surface, maintenance is just as crucial. The fountain's 1.3-meter-deep lake houses the powerful jets and robots, which means it requires constant attention to stay pristine.To keep the fountain looking its best, underwater robots are deployed regularly. These machines clean the lakebed and ensure the water remains at the highest quality. The newly installed soft flooring makes cleaning even quicker and more efficient, allowing for easier maintenance. Water quality checks are conducted regularly, with samples taken from various parts of the lake to ensure the water stays fresh and clear.While the fountain is temporarily out of action, Emaar has ensured that visitors still get a taste of its magic. The construction area has been cleverly integrated with digital display screens that play archival footage of the fountain’s past performances, in sync with the light shows from the Burj Khalifa. So even though the live fountain shows are paused, the spirit of the Dubai Fountain is still alive, giving visitors a preview of the wonder to come.The renovation is scheduled to wrap up by October 2025, just in time for the cooler months. When the fountain is back in action, it will not only look better but also function more smoothly, thanks to the impressive behind-the-scenes work currently underway.","The Dubai Fountain is known for its captivating performances, synchronized water jets, dazzling lights, and perfectly timed music.

Should work start at 6am in UAE? Here’s what some residents say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/should-work-start-at-6am-in-uae-heres-what-some-residents-say/articleshow/122240359.cms,"esidents in the UAE say starting work at 6am could improve focus, health, and work-life balance/image: pixabay

Early Risers Want to Finish Early

Experts Weigh In: Health and Productivity Benefits

Flexibility Is Key





Across the UAE, a growing number of residents are advocating for the workday to begin as early as 6am. Many say that aligning work hours with their natural morning routines, such as waking for Fajr prayer or exercising, would allow them to finish work earlier in the day. This shift could offer more time for rest, errands, and family, while also potentially boosting productivity and reducing screen fatigue, particularly during the scorching summer months.For Dubai resident Amina Al Hammadi, the day starts well before sunrise. Speaking to local news outlet Khaleej Times, she said that she wakes up for the Fajr prayer at around 4:03am.“I wake up for Fajr around 4.03am these days,” Amina said. “By the time I’m done with my prayer and breakfast, I’m wide awake and ready. But I still have to wait two, sometimes three hours before work starts. I wish I could just get going at 6am and finish early.”Amina believes that starting soon after Fajr prayer would enable her to complete her workday by 2pm, freeing up the rest of the afternoon for family time, rest, or errands. She pointed out that this schedule would be especially beneficial in the summer months, when the heat can be draining by midday.“In the summer, especially, the heat drains you by the afternoon. It would be so much better if we’re done by then,” she added.Similarly, Alex, an American expat working in sales in Dubai, starts his day with a run at 5am followed by a gym session. He shared with KT:“By 6am I’m fully alert, I’ve had my workout, my coffee, and I feel most productive. But I waste so much of that energy waiting for the workday to start. I’d rather finish by 2pm or 3pm and then have time for lunch, maybe a nap, and enjoy the evening.”Alex also noted the impact on screen fatigue. “In sales, you're constantly emailing or on Zoom. If I can frontload all that in the morning and get it over with, I’ll be sharper and less burned out.”While some UAE companies have adopted flexible schedules, a standard early start remains uncommon. Dr. Reem Al Marzouqi, a Dubai-based occupational health specialist, explained the scientific benefits of matching work hours with natural energy peaks.“People who wake up early tend to have higher cortisol levels in the morning, which boosts alertness and focus,” Dr. Al Marzouqi told KT. “Starting the workday earlier taps into that natural hormonal peak. Over time, this can enhance productivity and reduce dependence on stimulants like caffeine.”She also emphasized how earlier work hours can protect employees from the extreme heat typical of UAE summers.“Finishing by early afternoon means avoiding peak heat exposure, especially for those who commute or work in the field. It also opens up more usable daylight hours for rest, family or physical activity,” she explained.From a psychological standpoint, Dr. Al Marzouqi said earlier finishing times could reduce burnout caused by extended screen time late into the evening.“Working until 6pm or 7pm, then spending the evening on phones or laptops, affects circadian rhythms. Earlier wrap-up times give people a natural pause and allow their brains to disconnect before bed,” she said.Despite the benefits, Dr. Al Marzouqi cautioned that early starts are not a one-size-fits-all solution.“Some people are wired differently. For night owls, pushing a 6am start might backfire and increase fatigue. Flexibility is key, and employers should consider offering multiple shift options where possible,” she advised.She suggested companies experiment with pilot programs to find the best fit for both employees and business operations.“Even something simple like a 6am to 2pm trial twice a week can help identify what works best for both employee energy levels and business needs,” she concluded.","A growing number of UAE residents are advocating for the workday to begin as early as 6am. Many say that aligning work hours with their natural morning routines would allow them to finish work earlier in the day. This shift could offer more time for rest, errands, and family, while also potentially boosting productivity and reducing screen fatigue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122241084,imgsize-32174,width-400,resizemode-4/122241084.jpg"
Dubai: 10-year-old reports father’s abuse through Dubai Police smart app,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-10-year-old-reports-fathers-abuse-through-dubai-police-smart-app/articleshow/122236110.cms,"A 10-year-old boy in Dubai used the Dubai Police Smart App to report his father’s abuse, leading to swift intervention and ongoing support/ Image: File

A Cry for Help Through Technology:



Support from School Social Worker:



Father’s Justification and the Law’s Intervention:



Ongoing Support and Monitoring







In a heartbreaking yet courageous act, a 10-year-old boy in Dubai recently reported his father for repeated physical abuse, utilizing the Dubai Police smart app to seek help. The boy, identified only as A.A. , had been suffering in silence for months, unable to understand the reasons behind the physical punishments or to speak out about the pain he endured. His story, which has now been shared by Dubai Police, serves as a crucial reminder to the public that help is always available and that no child should suffer in silence.A.A.’s situation came to light when he was discreetly able to report his father’s cruelty via the Dubai Police smart app. Although the boy did not fully comprehend why he was being singled out for punishment, especially since his younger siblings were not subjected to the same treatment, the constant beatings left visible bruises on his body and a deep emotional scar. The pain was becoming unbearable, and he feared his classmates would notice. This fear, however, did not stop him from reaching out for help through the app, one of the many confidential channels available for reporting abuse.A.A.’s journey toward safety and healing began when his school noticed troubling signs. Teachers observed that the boy was struggling academically and showing physical signs of abuse. It was a school social worker who gently built trust with A.A. and, after some time, helped him feel comfortable enough to report the abuse through the police app. Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Ali Al Matrooshi, Director of the Child and Women Protection Department at Dubai Police, emphasized the importance of the school's role in identifying signs of abuse and supporting the child in coming forward.Dr. Al Matrooshi stated, “The child was afraid to speak up, but the bruises on his body and the fear on his face spoke volumes.”After receiving the report, Dubai Police acted swiftly, calling in the boy’s father for questioning. During this process, the father admitted to physically punishing his son but insisted that he never intended to cause harm. According to the father, his strict discipline was meant to “toughen up” his son, similar to the way he himself was raised. However, this justification was met with a firm response from the police.Dr. Al Matrooshi explained, “He thought that being strict would prepare his son for life, but instead, it left the child feeling alone, afraid, and falling behind in school.”The police made it clear to the father that such methods of discipline were not only damaging but also illegal under the UAE’s child protection laws. He was warned that corporal punishment and similar forms of abuse are punishable by law. The father expressed regret and promised to change his behavior, pledging to adopt more appropriate methods of parenting.The police have assured that A.A. will receive the necessary emotional support and counseling, in collaboration with social services. Dr. Al Matrooshi reassured the public that Dubai Police are committed to protecting children, providing support, and helping families heal. ""We are here to protect children, listen to them, and help families heal,"" he said.The case serves as a powerful reminder of the resources available to victims of abuse in the UAE. In line with the UAE’s Wadeema Law, which protects child rights, the General Department of Human Rights urges anyone aware of abuse to report it immediately, through the police app, website, or hotline (901). The Child Oasis Center at Al Twar police headquarters is also available for those who need in-person assistance.","A 10-year-old boy in Dubai recently reported his father for repeated physical abuse.

A Quiet Stroll Through London

The Royal Family's Strong Connection to London

The Summer 2024 Visit: A More Formal Occasion





Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, was recently spotted in London, where videos of his casual walk through the city have gained attention on social media platforms like TikTok.On July 2, 2025, several videos surfaced online showing Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum casually walking through London. In one clip, he was seen strolling down the city’s streets, exuding his usual calm and composed demeanor. The ruler, without any apparent security entourage or fanfare, appeared completely at ease, blending into the vibrant London environment with little attention.Another video captured Sheikh Mohammed entering a building lobby in the upscale Knightsbridge area. His visit was brief and low-key, reflecting his preference for simplicity and privacy while abroad.Perhaps the most engaging video was captured at a traffic light, where Sheikh Mohammed was seen waiting in his car. A passerby noticed him, waved, and the ruler responded with a brief wave of his own. The interaction was fleeting but highlighted his approachable and down-to-earth nature. The user who shared the video added the caption: ""POV: Chatting with the ruler of Dubai while waiting for a traffic light!"" This light-hearted moment quickly gained traction online, with many viewers noting the ruler’s openness during the casual encounter.The UAE royal family, especially Sheikh Mohammed, has a long-standing relationship with London. Over the years, they have frequently visited the city for both official engagements and personal vacations. London’s cosmopolitan atmosphere, coupled with its strong ties to the UAE, makes it a popular destination for many members of the royal family.In the past, Sheikh Mohammed’s visits have often drawn attention from fans and media alike. His preference for privacy while traveling, however, remains unchanged. The ruler has continued to enjoy his visits without excessive public display, often leaving his presence unnoticed or only becoming known after videos or photos are shared on social media platforms.Sheikh Mohammed’s 2024 trip to London was marked by a more formal event. During that visit, he became the first official guest at the opening of Parker’s London, the UK branch of the popular Dubai-born restaurant chain. His visit was considered a significant moment for the Emirati brand, which proudly shared images of the visit online, underscoring the ruler’s support for local businesses and talent on the international stage.Despite the grandeur of the occasion, Sheikh Mohammed’s presence remained humble, embodying his characteristic simplicity and grace.

Safety and Nightlife: UAE Cities Shine Globally

The Rise of Noctourism: Travel After Dark

Innovations in Nighttime Experiences: Dubai Leads the Way





A recent study by UK-based travel agency Travelbag has ranked Dubai as the third most scenic city in the world after dark, with Abu Dhabi also making the list at 12th place. The report highlights both UAE cities as global leaders not only in their nighttime beauty but also in safety for nighttime explorers.According to the Travelbag study, Abu Dhabi holds the distinction of being the safest city in the world to explore at night. Dubai also ranks highly, placing among the top three safest cities globally after sunset. This recognition underscores the strong emphasis both cities place on security and creating safe environments for residents and tourists alike.The study examined a range of factors including nightlife offerings and the quality of the urban environment at night. Dubai boasts 190 venues that stay open late, catering to night owls and tourists looking for evening entertainment. However, the city does face challenges with noise and light pollution, scoring 52.58 out of 100 on this scale.Abu Dhabi, on the other hand, has fewer late-night venues, with 62 establishments open late. It recorded a slightly lower pollution rating of 47, reflecting a quieter, less intense nighttime environment.This report taps into a broader trend known as ""noctourism,"" travel experiences and activities designed for after sunset. Booking.com predicts that nighttime travel will be one of the top trends in 2025, with tourists increasingly seeking unique adventures like stargazing and cosmic events in areas with minimal light pollution.Such trends are reflected in Dubai’s growing offerings. Many tours now focus exclusively on nighttime sightseeing, a practical response to the city's hot daytime temperatures. Tour agencies promote night tours that let visitors enjoy Dubai’s spectacular cityscape illuminated under the stars.Late-night desert safaris have also surged in popularity. Travelbag’s research notes a 22 percent jump in searches for night safaris, as tourists seek cooler and more atmospheric desert experiences after dark.To enhance night activities and provide comfort during hot summer months, Dubai Municipality has introduced “night swimming” at three public beaches. This initiative extends beach hours into the cooler night, allowing residents and visitors to enjoy swimming and beach activities without the intensity of daytime heat.These measures, along with the thriving nightlife scene, showcase Dubai’s commitment to making nighttime tourism safe, accessible, and enjoyable.This detailed report was compiled from Travelbag’s latest study, as referenced by multiple news outlets covering travel and urban lifestyle trends.","Dubai and Abu Dhabi ranked among the top three safest cities globally after sunset.

AI-assisted pregnancy: 8 million images in under an hour — how AI helped couple conceive after 18 years of struggle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ai-assisted-pregnancy-8-million-images-in-under-an-hour-how-ai-helped-couple-conceive-after-18-years-of-struggle/articleshow/122276082.cms,"



A couple has conceived after nearly two decades of unsuccessful attempts with the help of AI-based fertility breakthrough developed at the Columbia University Fertility Center in New York, reported NY Post. The STAR system -- short for Sperm Tracking and Recovery -- identified viable sperm in a man diagnosed with azoospermia, a condition previously believed to cause complete infertility.Columbia University announced the development in a press release, quoting Dr Zev Williams, director of the fertility center, who said, “A semen sample can appear totally normal, but when you look under the microscope, you discover just a sea of cellular debris, with no sperm visible.”Azoospermia affects up to 15% of infertile men, according to Columbia’s research. Until now, treatment options included painful surgical extraction or the use of donor sperm. “The options have typically been either to use donor sperm or to try undergoing a painful surgery where a portion of the testes is actually removed and they look in the testes to try to find sperm,” Williams told Today.com.In response, Williams and his team adapted technology originally used by astrophysicists to detect distant planets and stars.Over five years, they developed the STAR system, using artificial intelligence to scan high-powered images of semen samples.According to Williams, the system was tested on samples previously examined manually by embryologists without success. STAR located 44 viable sperm within an hour in one such sample. “We’re using the same technologies that are used to search for life in the universe to help create new life right here on Earth,” Williams said.In March 2025, a 38-year-old woman identified only as Rosie became the first to get pregnant using the STAR method. Speaking to Time magazine, she said, “There really was nothing else out there. Especially because I am running quite a few years ahead of where we should be [for fertility]. I’m not that old, but in fertility years — egg-wise — I was reaching my end.”Her husband, diagnosed with azoospermia, provided a semen sample that STAR scanned, capturing over 8 million images in less than an hour. AI algorithms identified three viable sperm cells, which were extracted robotically to avoid damage from traditional methods like centrifugation.“Imagine searching for a single needle hidden among a thousand haystacks scattered across ten football fields — and finding it in under two hours,” Williams told The Bump. “That’s the level of precision and speed delivered by the STAR system.”The sperm were used to fertilise Rosie’s eggs within two hours of collection. After successful embryo transfer, she is now five months pregnant. “I still wake up in the morning and can’t believe if this is true or not,” she told Time. The baby is expected in December 2025.The STAR system is currently available only at Columbia University Fertility Center. Dr. Williams told CNN the cost of identifying, isolating, and freezing sperm through STAR is just under $3,000. According to GoodRx, a standard IVF cycle in the US typically ranges from $12,400 to $15,000, but total expenses can exceed $30,000 with medications and genetic testing.While promising, the innovation has prompted calls for further evaluation. Dr. Robert Brannigan, president-elect of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, told The Washington Post, “At face value, this looks promising, but as with any new technology in medicine, especially in reproductive care, we need to follow the data and study it further.”The STAR breakthrough comes amid rising concerns over global male infertility. A study cited by Columbia found that sperm counts in Western men fell by 52.4% between 1973 and 2011. Researchers suspect environmental exposures, obesity, poor diets, and sedentary lifestyles as contributing factors.","A couple conceived after nearly two decades of unsuccessful attempts with the help of AI-based fertility breakthrough developed at the Columbia University Fertility Center in New York.

Why Indian-origin Zohran Mamdani identified as African-American in his college application,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-indian-origin-zohran-mamdani-identified-as-african-american-in-his-college-application/articleshow/122250461.cms,"The hierarchy of racial categories





The dilemma of tick-box identities





Colonial categories in modern America





The lesson









In America, race is not just a description of skin colour. It is a narrative slot, a ticket to visibility, legitimacy, or silent exclusion. For Zohran Mamdani , the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, the choice he made on his Columbia University application in 2009 now sits unearthed and scrutinised: he ticked the boxes for both “Asian” and “Black or African American. ”Born in Uganda to Indian parents, Mamdani does not identify as Black. When asked this week why he selected those categories, he said: “Most college applications don’t have a box for Indian-Ugandans, so I checked multiple boxes trying to capture the fullness of my background.”On the surface, it sounds like an act of calculated advantage-seeking. After all, Columbia, like most elite universities then, ran race-conscious admissions. Identifying as Black might have increased his chances in a system designed to redress centuries of racial exclusion. Critics, including Mayor Eric Adams, quickly pounced, calling it “an insult to every student who got into college the right way.”But the reality is more layered—and reveals how rigid, colonial-era categories continue to shape lives in ways that rarely match lived complexity.Indian but not Indian-AmericanMamdani is ethnically Indian, born to a Gujarati family whose ancestors migrated to East Africa over a century ago.His mother, Mira Nair, is a globally acclaimed filmmaker. His father, Mahmood Mamdani, is a leading postcolonial scholar. But in East Africa, Indians were neither fully African nor entirely Indian in identity. Under British colonialism, they were categorised as “Asiatics” and kept apart from both white settlers and native Africans. In Uganda, many thrived in trade and professions but remained perpetual outsiders—a status violently reinforced by Idi Amin’s 1972 expulsion of Asians.For Indian-Ugandans like Mamdani, identity has always been ambiguous: African by birth, Indian by ethnicity, but citizens of neither. When his family moved to New York in 1999, American forms forced a new set of boxes upon him. The Asian tick-box includes Indians, but rarely captures the distinct history of Indians in Africa. The African American box, meanwhile, is designed for descendants of the transatlantic slave trade and the Black American experience.Why, then, did he choose African American alongside Asian? Because in America, Blackness is recognised as a political identity born of struggle and oppression. Indian-American identity, by contrast, is often invisible—treated as an immigrant economic niche rather than a racial group needing justice. This is why even Kamala Harris , with a Tamil mother, emphasised her Black identity throughout her rise. The road to power in the US runs smoother through narratives of African American struggle than through the unrelatable caste-linguistic divisions of South Asia.Harris never denied her Indian heritage, but in political messaging, her mother’s dosa recipes were a footnote to her identity as a Black woman, a Howard alum, a beneficiary of the civil rights movement. To many Indian Americans, this choice felt strategic—because American categories do not accommodate multiple truths.For Mamdani, ticking African American was not an attempt to claim a heritage of slavery or Jim Crow. It was an attempt to signal: “I was born in Africa.” But these boxes don’t ask about birthplace; they ask about race. “Even though these boxes are constraining, I wanted my college application to reflect who I was,” he said. He also wrote in “Ugandan” under the form’s open-ended section. But forms don’t read nuance.The hack that revealed his application data showed no speeches or interviews where Mamdani ever called himself Black or African American. Indeed, his political identity today is rooted in his South Asian Muslim heritage. He campaigns in Urdu and Bangla, wears kurtas to rallies, and celebrates being the first South Asian man and Ugandan-born person in the New York State Assembly. Yet at African American gatherings, he references his African birthplace, Uganda’s independence, and his middle name Kwame, after Ghana’s first Prime Minister.It is a delicate tightrope. Identify as Black, and risk charges of opportunism. Identify as Indian, and remain a model minority forever foreign to the American political mainstream. Identify as both, and accusations of identity manipulation follow.The deeper problem is that these boxes themselves are relics of imperial racial classification systems. British colonial governments divided populations into neat ethno-racial columns to control them; the US census and college applications inherited this logic.

He attended Bowdoin College in Maine and majored in Africana studies. Today, as he challenges Mayor Eric Adams, who is Black, his identification as African American on that teenage application is now political ammunition.But perhaps his teenage choice was less about gaming the system and more about how the system forces you to game yourself: to slice your heritage into boxes acceptable to bureaucrats who will never understand why you don’t fit.And yet, despite ticking both boxes, Columbia rejected him.That is the lesson no one is talking about: racial categories promise advantage, but ultimately, they remain designed to keep out those who don’t fit neatly within them. Mamdani went to Bowdoin College in Maine and majored in Africana studies. Today, as he challenges Mayor Eric Adams, who is Black, his teenage application choices are political ammunition.Ultimately, Mamdani’s saga is not about affirmative action cheating or woke posturing. It is about the impossibility of conveying ancestral history, racial experience, birthplace, migration, expulsion, diaspora, and faith into two or three colonial tick-boxes.He remains an Indian, an African, a Muslim, and an American—all identities that refuse to fit neatly on a Common App form. The tragedy is that he, like so many children of empire, had to choose at all—and that even choosing everything was not enough.","Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, ticked the boxes for both ‘Asian’ and ‘Black or African American’ on his Columbia University application in 2009.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

BENGALURU: In the age of artificial intelligence, software engineers must evolve into decision-makers with CEO-like vision, said OpenAI’s VP of Engineering Srinivas Narayanan, speaking at the IIT Madras Alumni Association’s Sangam 2025 conference on Saturday.“The job is shifting from just writing code to asking the right questions and defining the ‘what’ and ‘why’ of a problem. AI can already handle much of the ‘how,’” Narayanan said, urging developers to focus on purpose and ambition over executional detail.Joining him on stage, Microsoft’s Chief Product Officer Aparna Chennapragada warned that simply retrofitting AI onto legacy tools won’t be enough. “AI isn’t a feature you can just add on. We need to start building with an AI-first mindset,” she said, pointing to how natural language interfaces are replacing traditional UX layers.The panel, moderated by IITMAA President and Unimity CEO Shyamala Rajaram, explored AI’s impact on jobs, product design, safety, and education. Chennapragada said the future belongs to those who combine deep expertise with generalist flexibility. “Prompt sets are the new PRDs,” she quipped, referring to how product teams now work closely with models to prototype faster and smarter.Narayanan shared that OpenAI’s models are already being used in medical diagnostics, citing a case where a reasoning model identified rare genetic disorders at a Berkeley-linked research lab. “The potential of AI as a collaborator, even in research, is enormous,” he said.On risks, Narayanan acknowledged challenges such as misinformation, unsafe outputs, and misuse. He noted that OpenAI recently rolled back a model for exhibiting ""sycophancy"" traits during testing, highlighting the company’s iterative deployment philosophy.Both speakers stressed accessibility and scale. While Chennapragada called for broader “CS + AI” fluency, Narayanan said model costs have dropped 100-fold over two years. “We want to democratise intelligence,” he said.Chennapragada closed with a thought: “In a world where intelligence is no longer the gatekeeper, the real differentiators will be ambition and agency.”","Software engineers must evolve into decision-makers with CEO-like vision.

"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Taiwan warns: These Chinese apps are sending users' data to China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/taiwan-warns-these-chinese-apps-are-sending-users-data-to-china/articleshow/122272433.cms,"How NSB found out Chinese apps are sending data to China

Ban on Chinese apps across the world

Taiwan's National Security Bureau (NSB) has warning for users of Chinese apps. In an advisory, NSB said that China-developed apps like RedNote (Xiaohongshu), Weibo, TikTok, WeChat and Baidu Cloud pose security risks due to excessive data collection and data transfer to China. The alert reportedly comes following an inspection of these apps carried out in coordination with the Taiwan's Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) and the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) under the National Police Agency.NSB said that the results indicate the existence of security issues, including excessive data collection and privacy infringement. It further warned, ""The public is advised to exercise caution when choosing mobile apps."" NSB also pointed out that companies operating in China are obligated to turn over user data under domestic laws for national security, public security, and intelligence purposes. So, using these apps can breach the privacy of users.The agency said that it evaluated Chinese apps against 15 indicators spanning five broad categories: Personal data collection, excessive permission usage, data transmission and sharing, system information extraction, and biometric data access.According to the analysis, RedNote violated all 15 indicators, followed by Weibo and TikTok that were found to breach 13 indicators. WeChat and Baidu Cloud violated 10 and 9 of the 15 indicators, respectively.These issues encompassed extensive collection of personal data, including facial recognition information, screenshots, clipboard contents, contact lists, and location information. All the apps have also been flagged for harvesting the list of installed apps and device parameters.""With regard to data transmission and sharing, the said five apps were found to send packets back to servers located in China,"" the NSB said. ""This type of transmission has raised serious concerns over the potential misuse of personal data by third-parties.""Taiwan's warning comes after several nations across the world have banned or restricted certain Chinese apps. In June 2020, India announced ban almost 100 Chinese-made apps, citing national security concerns. In November 2024, Canada ordered TikTok to dissolve its operations in the country.Last week, one of Germany's data protection authorities asked Apple and Google to remove Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot DeepSeek from their respective app stores. The Germany's data protection authourity accused DeepSeek of unlawful user data transfers to China. Several other countries too have announced similar restrictions on DeepSeek.","Taiwan's National Security Bureau (NSB) has warning for users of Chinese apps.
