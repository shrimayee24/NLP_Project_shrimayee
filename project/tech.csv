What did Paul Heyman have to say about the former WWE World Heavyweight Champion Brock Lesnar?

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs funny, when people ask me about that‚Ä¶ Brock Lesnar doesn‚Äôt like to be discussed about anything about his life that is off-camera. If I do speak to Brock Lesnar, he would want that to be private. If I don‚Äôt speak with Brock Lesnar, he would want that to be private. Based on both love and appreciation for the man, and a healthy dose of absolute fear of the man, I will neither confirm nor deny my knowledge of even the existence of a species on this planet that carries the name Brock Lesnar.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really put any thought into that at this time because it‚Äôs not a subject that is going to resolve itself by

Paul Heyman has been embroiled in the Bloodline storyline following his triumphant return to Roman Reigns‚Äô aid with CM Punk who is the OG Paul Heyman guy. However, other than him, Heyman has extensively been associated with Brock Lesnar too, who off late, has been off camera.Brock Lesnar‚Äôs name surfaced in the Janel Grant lawsuit, and since then the wrestler has been away from WWE Programming, and the Stamford-based promotion has scaled back his references to a great degree. Recently when asked about the Beast Incarnate, Paul Heyman took a very diplomatic approach about the matter.When asked about Brock Lesnar at a CBS Sport interview with Shakiel Majouri, Paul Heyman avoided the question in an easy manner.

This lawsuit has been a thorn in the side of the company, so the Stamford-based promotion would like to be done with it before proceeding with anything or anyone even remotely involved in the matter.","Paul Heyman has been embroiled in the Bloodline storyline following his triumphant return to Roman Reigns‚Äô aid with CM Punk.

The book includes several detailed stories from her career in WWE but the the stories involving Vince McMahon got wider attention. Recently, Lynch has shared her reasons for keeping those accounts untouched in the final version of her book.It is no secret that Vince McMahon has been one of the most controversial figures in WWE history. Even now, he is surrounded by some of the biggest controversies in his career. Amid Janel Grant‚Äôs case against the former WWE boss, Becky Lynch shared that she did not edit out anything on McMahon. During an appearance at the Vulture Festival, Lynch was asked whether Vince McMahon‚Äôs resignation from WWE and his departure to TKO Holdings had any impact on what she included in her memoir.Lynch shared that by the time Vince McMahon stepped down from WWE, she had already finished most of her memoir. As she entered the editing phase, she found it challenging to adjust the content in light of McMahon's departure. Instead, Lynch chose to stick with the personal experiences she had already written, focusing on her own journey with him.‚ÄúWell, so I had kind of finished the book for the most part. By the time he had stepped down. And then I was in the editing process, and it would have been hard to kind of navigate. So I just kind of had to keep to my experiences.

How to Watch Thanksgiving NFL Games



NFL fans are preparing for one of the most cherished holiday traditions in sports: the Thanksgiving Day triple-header. As teams begin their playoff pushes, this year‚Äôs lineup promises excitement, featuring pivotal matchups with postseason implications. The 2024 NFL Thanksgiving schedule is packed with action, and fans won‚Äôt want to miss a single moment of the gridiron drama. This year‚Äôs games will showcase teams battling for playoff berths, bringing high-stakes football to living rooms across the country. With a mix of rivalry clashes and must-watch encounters, the day offers something for every football enthusiast.Thanksgiving Day 2024 brings an exciting lineup of NFL games that fans won't want to miss. From historical traditions to playoff implications, the day's matchups offer a feast of football action. Here's what to expect from the Chicago Bears vs. Detroit Lions , New York Giants vs. Dallas Cowboys , and Miami Dolphins vs. Green Bay Packers .The day kicks off with the Detroit Lions hosting the Chicago Bears at Ford Field, Detroit, at 12:30 p.m. ET. This tradition, started by the Lions in 1934, continues to anchor Thanksgiving football. CBS will broadcast the game, with live streaming options on Fubo, Paramount+, and NFL+ (Chicago area).Detroit (10-1) enters the game with a chance to extend its winning streak to 10 games while also breaking a seven-game Thanksgiving losing skid. Securing a victory would position the Lions to clinch a playoff berth, a feat they haven‚Äôt achieved in consecutive seasons since the mid-'90s. The Bears (4-7), reeling from a five-game losing streak, aim to bounce back after their 30-27 overtime defeat to the Minnesota Vikings. While Detroit's playoff aspirations shine brightly, Chicago's resilience will be tested on a short recovery week.At 4:30 p.m. ET, the Dallas Cowboys face the New York Giants at AT&T Stadium, Arlington, Texas. Fox will air the game, with streaming on Fubo and NFL+. Since 1966, the Cowboys have made Thanksgiving football a centerpiece, following the Lions' earlier match.Dallas (4-7) is fresh off an upset victory over Washington, showing offensive promise despite Dak Prescott's absence due to a hamstring injury. Quarterback Cooper Rush and defensive powerhouse Micah Parsons are poised to deliver against a struggling Giants team (2-9). New York, plagued by quarterback uncertainty, will rely on either Tommy DeVito or Drew Lock after Daniel Jones' departure and DeVito's recent injury. The Giants must overcome significant hurdles to avoid another crushing defeat.The Thanksgiving tripleheader concludes at 8:20 p.m. ET with the Green Bay Packers hosting the Miami Dolphins at Lambeau Field. NBC will broadcast the game, and streaming options include Fubo and Peacock.Green Bay (8-3) aims to maintain its position in the competitive NFC North, while Miami (5-6) fights to solidify its wild-card contender status. Weather conditions, expected to dip to 19¬∞F, could challenge Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, who has yet to win in sub-45¬∞F games. If Miami can overcome the cold, it could keep its postseason hopes alive.Also Read: Why the NFL features Cowboys and Lions every Thanksgiving: The history behind the holiday games Fans can stream games on services like YouTube TV, Fubo, or directly via network apps such as Fox Sports, Peacock, and Paramount+.

A well-known French plastic surgeon , Olivier Gerbault , has been suspended from practicing for two years after multiple patients accused him of performing unsatisfactory nose surgeries. Gerbault , known for his ultrasonic rhinoplasty technique, allegedly left some patients with breathing difficulties and deformities.Several women who filed complaints with the medical ethics committee described their noses as resembling ""potatoes"" after the procedures, according to a New York Post report. Elisa, one of the patients, said:‚ÄúMy nose was long, crooked, thick, and looked like a potato. My left nostril was collapsing, and I couldn‚Äôt get any air through.‚ÄùAnother patient, Chlo√©, reported similar experiences, claiming her nose became infected and her nostrils collapsed after the surgery. She said:‚ÄúI had a lump [in place of my nose], a big potato. From then on, I lost all taste for life.‚ÄùAlix, another patient, alleged Gerbault inserted a chin prosthesis without her consent during her rhinoplasty.‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôve been mutilated,"" Alix said, as quoted by New York Post. ""When I woke up, I was vomiting liters of blood. The doctor must have used a trowel. Since then, I‚Äôve had a horrible burning sensation, air rushes in too strongly, and it gets on my nerves. Gerbault has ruined my life.‚ÄùGerbault, 58, received a two-year ban in November 2023.Despite the suspension, Gerbault continues to practice with permission from local authorities. He denies all allegations, claiming the complaints are part of a smear campaign orchestrated by a rival surgeon.‚ÄúThese patients are all connected and the complaints are strictly the same, sometimes down to the last word. It‚Äôs obvious they are being helped by a colleague, which is particularly serious and unprofessional,‚Äù Gerbault said, as quoted by New York Post.The surgeon is currently appealing the suspension.","Olivier Gerbault, a well-known French plastic surgeon, has been suspended from practicing for two years.

Macquarie Dictionary names 'Enshittification' Word of the Year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/australian-dictionary-picks-enshittification-as-word-of-the-year/articleshow/115714471.cms,"File photo

Colloquial, the gradual deterioration of a service or product brought about by a reduction in the quality of service provided, especially of an online platform, and as a consequence of profit-seeking.""The word, coined by writer Cory Doctorow , refers to a process in which apps or digital platforms start off as incredibly useful, but gradually worsen as they seek to make a profit.Social media platforms like X and ride-sharing app Uber are frequently cited examples, which started off offering information or bargains but gradually gouged customers or cut back services.Doctorow explains enshittification as the reason why Facebook users' feeds fill up with junk, Google search is loaded with ads and sponsored content, and why Amazon promotes cheap, badly made products no matter what a customer searches for.Enshittification beat out words like ""brainrot"", ""overtourism"" and ""rawdogging"".It was chosen as word of the year by the dictionary's committee of experts, but was also voted ""People's Choice Winner"".It is ""a very basic Anglo-Saxon term wrapped in affixes which elevate it to being almost formal; almost respectable,"" the committee said.""This word captures what many of us feel is happening to the world and to so many aspects of our lives at the moment,"" the committee said.","Australia's quasi-official Macquarie Dictionary has picked "" enshittification "" as the word of 2024.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Why Indonesia has banned new iPhones

Indonesia has reportedly rejected Apple's $100 million investment proposal, deeming it insufficient to meet the country's ""fairness"" principles. The government is seeking further negotiations before lifting a ban on iPhone 16 sales.Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita criticized Apple's investment disparity between Indonesia and Vietnam. While Apple has poured billions into Vietnam's manufacturing facilities, its investment in Indonesia, a larger market, has been significantly less. ‚ÄúWe want Apple to return to do business here but we need a fair resolution,‚Äù Kartasasmita said, as per a report in Bloomberg. He further added, ‚ÄúWe want Apple to send negotiation teams to meet us.‚ÄùIndonesia's ban on iPhone 16 sales stems from Apple's failure to comply with local content regulations, which require 40% of phone components to be sourced domestically. The government is pushing for increased local manufacturing and investment from tech giants like Apple.Apple's latest offer, a $100 million investment, is still considered inadequate by Indonesian officials. The government is demanding that Apple fulfill its 2023 investment pledge, provide a more substantial offer for 2024-2026, and ultimately establish a manufacturing plant in Indonesia.This isn't the first time Indonesia has taken a tough stance on foreign tech companies. The country has also banned Google Pixel phones due to similar investment issues and imposed restrictions on TikTok's shopping feature.While Apple may not be a dominant player in the Indonesian smartphone market, the country's large and growing tech-savvy population presents a significant opportunity for the company. Both parties are working towards a resolution that benefits both sides, but the future of Apple products in Indonesia remains uncertain.","Indonesia has rejected Apple's $100 million investment proposal, deeming it insufficient to meet the country's ""fairness"" principles.

""This is a good example of an unexpected problem of existing technology,"" he said, highlighting the risks of emotionally ""perfect"" AI girlfriends that might consume users' thought processes.The tech veteran is especially concerned about young men's susceptibility to these digital relationships. ""That kind of obsession is possible,"" Schmidt emphasized, ""Especially for people who are not fully formed."" His concerns are grounded in broader observations about technological impact, noting that social media algorithms can lead individuals to find ""like-minded people who ultimately radicalize them.""Schmidt's warnings come amid growing societal anxieties about AI's psychological implications. A recent and tragic example involves a mother suing the chatbot startup Character.AI after her 14-year-old son's suicide, allegedly following inappropriate interactions with an AI chatbot.While acknowledging the technology's potential, Schmidt advocates for nuanced regulation. He suggests amending laws like Section 230 to introduce liability for technology companies in extreme cases. However, he remains skeptical about immediate regulatory action, predicting that significant changes will likely require ""some kind of calamity.""",Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt is concerned about the potential psychological dangers of AI romantic relationships.
