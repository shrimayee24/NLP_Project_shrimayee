NEW DELHI: The Indian Army is on the cusp of becoming the world’s first armed force to operationally deploy ramjet-powered artillery shells for its 155 mm guns. The advanced technology, developed in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras and with support of Army Technology Board (ATB), is now under trial.Ramjet propulsion is not new and has been used in missiles worldwide. However, applying the technology to artillery shells is a revolutionary step.Professors P A Ramakrishna and S Verma from IIT Madras' Department of Aerospace Engineering co-developed a ramjet-powered artillery shell after years of research. The technology, developed under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, is designed to significantly extend the reach of standard tube artillery.Prof Ramakrishna recently explained that a ramjet operates as an air-breathing engine that does not require turbines or compressors. It relies on the shell being launched to speeds of approx Mach 2 using an artillery gun. At this velocity, air entering the engine is naturally compressed, fuel is ignited and thrust is produced, which allows the shell to maintain propulsion and significantly extend its range.“Being an air-breathing engine, ramjet has higher specific impulse (ISP) (> 4000 N s/kg) compared to that of a solid rocket (~2500 N s/kg) and, therefore, provides much higher overall impulse to the shell for the same mass of propellant,” the IIT-M research paper said.One of the key challenges IIT-M team faced was using ramjet to have high combustion efficiency with restricted secondary combustor length. However, the team managed to overcome this obstacle.The technology promises to extend the range of conventional artillery shells by 30% to 50% while maintaining their destructive power. By integrating ramjet technology into 155 mm shells, the Army obtained the ability to strike deeper targets with greater effectiveness. Developmental trials are currently under way, with successful tests already conducted at the Pokhran field firing ranges. These trials have demonstrated the feasibility of retrofitting ramjet modules onto existing 155 mm shells, meaning the technology can be applied across the Army’s current inventory without requiring entirely new ammunition designs.Once the ramjet artillery shell technology is ready for induction, it can be used in any of the Army’s artillery systems, including on the US-imported M777 ultra-light howitzer.","The Indian Army is on the cusp of becoming the world’s first armed force to operationally deploy ramjet-powered artillery shells for its 155 mm guns.

Vande Bharat sleeper train to be launched soon! In a big New year cheer for Indian Railways passengers, railway minister Ashwini Vaishaw has announced that the first Vande Bharat sleeper train will be launched this month. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to flag off the Vande Bharat sleeper train in the second half of January 2026.Vande Bharat sleeper is a fully air-conditioned train set that has been manufactured by Indian Railways for long-distance routes and overnight journeys. According to Ashwini Vaishnaw , two Vande Bharat sleeper train sets are ready and have undergone successful trial runs. The new trains will be operated on 1,200-1,500 kmph routes of the national transporter.The first Vande Bharat sleeper train will run between Guwahati and Kolkata, Ashwini Vaishnaw announced on Thursday. Each Vande Bharat sleeper train has 16 coaches. The composition of the coaches is: 11 AC 3-tier, 4 AC 2-tier, and one AC 1st coach. The train can accommodate 823 passengers. Vaishnaw said that eight more Vande Bharat sleeper trains will be rolled out in the next six months, and the total will go up to 12 by year-end.The new train is scheduled to run between Howrah and Guwahati (Kamakhya). According to Indian Railways, the following districts will be benefitted:Ashwini Vaishnaw recently shared a video on X, formerly known as Twitter, showcasing the train undergoing high-speed trials on the Indian Railways network.During test runs conducted on the Kota–Nagda route, the Vande Bharat sleeper train achieved its top design speed of 180 kmph. A notable highlight from the trial was a stability demonstration in which glasses filled with water remained perfectly balanced without any water spilling even at over 180 kmph speed.“Vande Bharat Sleeper tested today by Commissioner ailway Safety. It ran at 180 kmph between Kota Nagda section. And our own water test demonstrated the technological features of this new generation train,” Ashwini Vaishnaw wrote in his post on X.Designed for overnight and long-haul journeys, the Vande Bharat sleeper train is the sleeping-class counterpart of the Vande Bharat chair car services already operating across the country.At present, two prototype rakes of the Vande Bharat sleeper train have been produced by BEML. Indian Railways is also gearing up for a broader transformation of long-distance travel, with plans to roll out more than 200 such sleeper trains in the coming years, supported by several ongoing manufacturing initiatives.BEML is jointly producing 10 Vande Bharat sleeper train sets in partnership with the Integral Coach Factory. Another batch of 10 sleeper rakes is being built by Kinet, a joint venture involving Indian and Russian entities. In addition, a consortium led by Titagarh Rail Systems along with BHEL has secured an order to manufacture 80 sleeper-class trainsets.

"Like commercial vehicles, soon private vehicles need to get fitness test done at automated testing stations",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/like-commercial-vehicles-soon-private-vehicles-need-to-get-fitness-test-done-at-automated-testing-stations/articleshow/126275967.cms,"Representational photo

NEW DELHI: Soon all private vehicles like cars and bikes will have to get their fitness and pollution tests done at automated test stations (ATS) for renewal of registration as it is in the case of commercial vehicles. The ATS or the inspecting officer will also need to upload at least a 10 seconds geotagged video of the vehicle at the time of fitness test before issuing any certificate.The road transport ministry has proposed key changes in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, including this, through a draft notification to prevent the malpractice of vehicle owners managing to get fitness certificates even without visiting ATS or other testing centres. This also gains significance in the light of increasing concern over air pollution and fitness of vehicles.Fitness certificate is mandatory for renewal of registration of private vehicles after attaining 15 years, and subsequently, in every five years.As per the draft notification, private vehicles, like commercial ones, will need to visit ATS, where these are established, for fitness tests. At present, there are over 160 ATS operational across the country.To ensure that the certificates are issued after carrying out genuine tests, the draft notification says that “the renewal of a certificate of fitness shall be made only after uploading at least a 10 seconds geotagged video of the vehicle at the time of fitness test, capturing the vehicle from front, rear, right side and left side ensuring clear visibility of the registration number plate, chassis number, engine number and features of the vehicle” by an authorised testing station or inspecting officer after carrying out the specified tests.In a bid to avoid vehicle owners using legal provisions to apply for multiple re-tests after vehicles fail to pass the fitness test, the proposed norms say that if a vehicle is not declared as ‘fit’ within 180 days from the first date of vehicle declared as ‘unfit’ the vehicle shall be categorised as ‘End of Life Vehicle (ELV)’ and flagged in the Vahan database as ‘ELV’.Officials said till now people used to get the timeline extended by simply submitting fees just days before the expiry of 180 days. “That won’t be possible any more. They need to get the fitness certificate within 180 days from the day the first test found the vehicle as unfit. Enough safeguards have been put in place to ensure that any ATS doesn’t give incorrect test result,” said an official.",The road transport ministry has proposed key changes in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules.

The psychology behind fraud: Why people fall prey despite knowing better,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-psychology-behind-fraud-why-people-fall-prey-despite-knowing-better/articleshow/126298769.cms,"Representative AI image

The answer lies not in ignorance, but in psychology.

​Why even cautious people fall for scams

The psychological biases scammers exploit

Emotional manipulation, she added, is equally deliberate.

Scarcity is another powerful tool.

Emotional stress blinds people

Red flags may still be visible, but the brain temporarily ignores them because emotional safety feels more urgent than accuracy. This is why scams often target people during vulnerable moments — late at night, after a loss, or during financial uncertainty. Dr Radhika Goyal, Psychologist

Emotional stress such as fear of loss, financial pressure, or loneliness activates the limbic system, particularly the amygdala, which prioritizes emotional survival responses over careful analysis. Dr Medha, Assistant Professor, Psychology

Why victims often stay silent

Breaking the psychological grip

A human vulnerability, not a personal failure

It’s easy to judge people who fell for scams. Many times, one simply thinks, “they should have known better”, label them foolish, naive, careless, or ignorant. After all, warnings are everywhere. Banks keep issuing alerts, digital platforms run awareness campaigns and news regularly reports on the latest frauds and cybercrimes.​Yet, when one looks more closely at how scams actually work, fraud is rarely the result of low intelligence or a lack of information. People who are cautious in one context can be disarmingly vulnerable in another. Those who pride themselves on scepticism can make impulsive decisions under pressure. The question, then, is not why people fail to “know better,” but why knowing better so often fails to protect them.​Scams succeed because they are engineered to move past rational judgement rather than confront it. Understanding the psychology behind fraud requires setting aside moral judgement and confronting an uncomfortable truth: vulnerability to scams is not an exception but a human trait. Frauds happen not because people are foolish, but because scammers exploit how people think, react, and cope under emotional stress.If knowledge were a substitute for preventing fraud, scams would not be this pervasive. The fact is that some of the most articulate, tech-savvy, and financially educated individuals are duped into cash transfers, sharing credentials, or clicking links that under normal circumstances they never would have trusted.The reason is that scams do not challenge what people know; they manipulate how people feel and think.As Dr Radhika Goyal, PhD (Psychology), said, in her insights shared with TOI , “Scams work by bypassing rational thinking and triggering automatic emotional responses. Even highly educated or careful individuals rely on mental shortcuts in daily life to make quick decisions. Fraudsters design situations that feel urgent, personal, or threatening, pushing the brain into ‘survival mode’.”When this happens, the emotional brain (which reacts fast) overrides the logical brain (which analyses slowly). In that moment, intelligence offers little protection, because the scam is not engaging logic, it is exploiting trust, fear, or hope.”Dr Medha, Assistant Professor of Psychology at Patna Women’s College (Autonomous), Patna University, situated this vulnerability within a well-established psychological framework, as she talked to TOI.“Even cautious, intelligent, or well-educated individuals can fall victim to scams because fraudulent schemes exploit normal psychological processes rather than ignorance. From a psychological perspective, scams function by bypassing rational thinking and activating emotional and automatic responses"" she said.She further explained this through Kahneman’s Dual-Process Theory.Fraudsters do not rely on random manipulation. They repeatedly exploit predictable cognitive biases that guide human behaviour in legitimate social settings.These biases are not flaws, they are mental shortcuts that help people function efficiently in everyday life.By pretending to be, say, a bank representative, an authority from a government department, an important executive, and short-circuiting the time it takes to reach a decision, scammers tap into compliance ahead of skepticism and reasoning. This insight into behavior is vital, because it helps to re-understand fraud not just as trickery using clever telling, but at its root, an exploitation of psychology, using guilt, fear, and other trigger mechanisms. ​​Dr Radhika Goyal identified several of the most commonly used psychological levers.Meanwhile, Dr Medha linked these tactics to foundational psychological theories. Authority-based scams, she notes, draw directly from research on obedience.“Scammers are effective because they take advantage of fundamental psychological theories that explain how humans perceive, decide, and behave in social contexts. These theories highlight that human decision-making is often guided by automatic, emotional, and socially conditioned processes rather than deliberate reasoning,” she said.Further elaborating on individual behaviour, she added, “Individuals have a strong tendency to comply with perceived authority figures. Scammers exploit this bias by impersonating officials such as bank representatives, police officers, or government agents. The presence of authority cues—formal language, uniforms, or official symbols—reduces resistance and critical questioning, leading individuals to comply even when requests are unreasonable. -This has been supported by Milgram’s theory of obedience.”“Strong emotions such as fear, hope, guilt, or affection activate the limbic system, which can overpower rational control mechanisms in the prefrontal cortex. Scammers intentionally evoke emotional reactions to impair logical evaluation and promote impulsive decisions,"" the assistant professor added, citing Damasio's Affective Decision-Making Theory.Dr Medha explained how scammers can trigger ""scarcity bias"" to trap people. Citing Cialdini's Persuasion theory, the professor explained, ""Scarcity bias occurs when people assign greater value to opportunities perceived as limited.""Scammers exploit this by saying things such as- “Offer valid for 24 hours”, “Only a few slots left”. Another tactic that fraudsters use is ""fear of missing out (FOMO)"" which ""shifts thinking from evaluation to action”, explained the professor.One of the most troubling aspects of fraud is that victims often recognise warning signs, but only in hindsight. Emotional stress plays a key role in this temporary blindness.“Emotional stress narrows attention. When someone is anxious about money, scared of legal trouble, or feeling lonely, their brain prioritizes relief over verification,"" said Dr Goyal.Further explaining the psychological mindset of the people under stress, she added, ""Under stress, people focus on solving the immediate emotional discomfort — “How do I stop this problem right now?” — instead of asking critical questions.""Dr Medha described the same process at the neurological level:Further talking about the stress factor, the professor said, “This heightened emotional arousal weakens the functioning of the prefrontal cortex, reducing logical reasoning, impulse control, and risk evaluation. As a result, individuals rely more on fast, intuitive processing rather than deliberate, analytical thinking, even when warning signs are present. Stress also narrows attention to emotionally relevant cues, causing people to overlook inconsistencies or red flags that would normally signal fraud. Consequently, the desire to quickly relieve emotional distress overrides caution, making individuals more vulnerable to deceptive tactics.”Even after realizing that they’ve been swindled, victims often opt not to speak out. In most cases, this is not because they lack information or do not care, but due to complex factors involving psychological, social, as well as structural barriers that ultimately favor the fraudsters.Shame and self-blame are some of the deterrents. Victims often internalise responsibility, believing they were “careless” or “gullible,” despite scams being deliberately engineered to exploit normal human trust and authority cues. Admitting the fraud can feel like admitting a personal failure, particularly for educated or financially savvy individuals.Fear of judgement adds to the reluctance. Victims worry about how family members, employers, or peers will see them, especially when the loss involves large sums or repeated transactions. In a professional environment, disclosure may be seen as reputationally damaging, reinforcing the instinct to stay quiet.There is also a general feeling that nothing worthwhile will come out of reporting and that what has been lost is irretrievable. This perceived futility discourages reporting, even where formal channels exist.In this context, confusion and intimidation also prevail. Frauds involve tricks and mind games that include numerous platforms, jurisdictions, and phony identities. Victims often do not know to whom they need to report, what evidence will be required, or fear being dragged into long and stressful investigations. Some are even threatened bluntly by the scammers, further suppressing disclosure.Dr Goyal pointed to shame as a central barrier. “Shame is a major barrier. Victims often blame themselves, thinking, ‘I should have known better.’ This self-blame is intensified by social stigma that equates being scammed with being foolish.”Talking about the feeling of shame leads to isolation, she added, ""Fraudsters deliberately reinforce this shame, telling victims to keep the matter confidential or warning them they will ‘get into trouble’ if they speak up. Unfortunately, silence protects the scammer and isolates the victim further. Psychologically, it is easier to stay quiet than to confront embarrassment — even when reporting could prevent harm to others. ”Meanwhile, Dr Medha explained that self-blame is deeply tied to identity. “Victims often internalize the fraud as a personal failure, believing they should have been more careful, which leads to self-blame rather than attributing responsibility to the scammer. Shame triggers avoidance behavior, causing individuals to hide the experience to protect their self-image and social identity.”“Additionally, cognitive dissonance makes it emotionally uncomfortable to admit having been deceived, especially for educated or competent individuals. Together, shame, damaged self-esteem, and fear of stigma significantly reduce the likelihood of reporting scams, despite the importance of doing so,"" she added.As scams operate at the emotional, mental level, resisting them requires psychological interruption. In general, fraud succeeds not because the victims are uninformed, but rather because jacked-up emotions temporarily displace rational judgment.Scammers create a situation that instills urgency, fear, or excitement, forcing fast decisions, narrowing attention, and suppressing doubt. In such a state, one may even fail to notice flagrant red flags. The best counter remains pause: slowing down, stepping away from the communication, or delaying any action, which breaks the emotional momentum on which scams depend.A second opinion is equally important. Bringing in a trusted third party reintroduces perspective and exposes inconsistencies that are hard to see under pressure. In practice, the strongest defences against fraud are behavioural — time, distance, and verification — rather than just knowledge.Dr Goyal emphasised on simple but effective pauses.Meanwhile, Dr Medha framed resistance as “mind over manipulation.”""Using Mind Over Manipulation — Scams succeed when emotion outruns reasoning. Breaking a scam requires slowing down emotion, widening perspective, and re-activating rational control,"" she said.She outlined concrete steps:The main point to understand in this is that fraud thrives in the space between emotion and reason. It succeeds, not because people lack intelligence, but because they are humans; capable of fear, hope, trust, and urgency. Con artists structure their approach based on these universal characteristics, taking advantage of the instances where the responses are instinctual, meaning where a reaction exceeds the boundaries of logical processing.The susceptibility to a scam is not an anomaly but a side effect of human instincts in pressing circumstances. Recognising this distinction is critical. It shifts the narrative away from personal failure and towards systemic manipulation. When victims understand that they were targeted through deliberate psychological engineering, shame loses its power and reporting becomes more likely. This, in turn, improves visibility into how fraud networks operate and where safeguards fail.The more society moves away from blaming victims and towards understanding the psychology of manipulation, the harder it becomes for fraudsters to win. Awareness framed around human vulnerability encourages openness, earlier intervention, and collective defence; thus, weakening the conditions that allow scams to spread unchecked.","Psychologist Dr Radhika Goyal, PhD (Psychology), said, “Scams work by bypassing rational thinking and triggering automatic emotional responses” Fraudsters design situations that feel urgent, personal, or threatening, pushing the brain into ‘survival mode’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126319854,imgsize-1451180,width-400,resizemode-4/article-1.jpg"

In September this year, Arattai (meaning chat in Tamil) topped App Store ranking, registering 3,50,000 signs in just three days.Arattai offers familiar features such as:However, the app is still ironing out issues. Users have reported OTP delays, slower contact sync, and call glitches due to server overload.Last month, the company rolled out system-wide end-to-end encryption on the Arattai app. Announcing the release in an X post, Vembu then said that it is a “forced upgrade on all because it is a drastic change”.“We had to do some redesign around it and we wanted extensive testing because it is a drastic change. It is now being tested by about 6,000 people in the company. We identified some issues and have fixed them. We are doing one more round of testing on a new build that has fixed the issues identified,” he then said.","Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu was recently asked by an X (formerly Twitter) user why there is no talk about Arattai now. The user quoted a post stating that Telegram is worth $30 billion with only 30 employees working from home, no office. “We will market it more once we feel we are satisfied with the feature set!,” Vem Bu posted, adding “This is a marathon.

American billionaire and Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban has revealed that he avoids phone calls altogether. As reported by Fortune, in a TikTok video posted by Masterclass, Cuban said, “No, I don’t do calls. You know, I’ll engage with you via email, and trust me, I do this all the time. I’m really good at it.” He further explained that emails enable him to craft a more thoughtful responses and also helps him in preventing from forgetting details midst his bust schedule. “I’ll give you more comprehensive responses than if it was via phone,” he noted, adding that emails also provide a searchable record of conversations.Cuban’s stance echoes a broader generational trend. Many Gen Zers prefer email or text over calls, but for different reasons. A 2024 study found nearly a quarter of the generation avoids answering phone calls entirely, often due to telephobia — a form of phone anxiety that can trigger physical symptoms such as nausea, shaking, and difficulty concentrating.Talking to Business Insider, Billionaire Mark Cuban revealed that his daily routine is not at all exciting rather it’s quite boring. “I read and respond to emails,"" he wrote in an email.""I work out. I read and respond to emails. I do a couple Zooms. Then I read and respond to emails. Then I eat dinner. Then I read and respond to emails,” Cuban told BI.He revealed that his day starts with a decaf coffee and a cookie. He then takes her daughter to school and after that he works out at Life Time Fitness. Once done with the fitness regimen he again dives into his inbox. Despite his wealth, Cuban refuses to hire an assistant to manage his email, saying it would only “slow things down.”“I receive around 700 emails a day and use three phones (two Android and one iPhone) to manage everything. I'd rather get 700 to 1,000 emails than sit in long, boring meetings,” Cuban told BI.He emphasised that emails work for him because they come with searchable history. He also use Gmail’s auto-replies for 10–20% of messages. Cuban also mentioned that that in order to stay focused he keeps the unread emails under 20.Cuban rarely disconnects from email—even on vacation. “It’s faster to just get it out of the way,” he said. Only family events or emergencies prompt him to step away from his inbox for more than a few hours.While some may find his routine monotonous, Cuban sees it as a strategic advantage.","Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban has revealed that he avoids phone calls altogether.

Apple may skip iPhone 18 launch in 2026: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-may-skip-iphone-18-launch-in-2026-report/articleshow/126298730.cms,"Apple's Foldable iPhone is Coming, Here’s Why it Matters

Why iPhone 18 may not launch in 2026





Apple iPhone 18 standard model may not launch this year, says a new report by MacRumours. Other models under the iPhone 18 series – iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max are likely to have the usual launch timeline and are expected to come in September 2026. As per the report, the Cupertino-based company may unveil its first foldable ‌iPhone‌ during the fall event.“For more than a decade, Apple has introduced its mainline ‌iPhone‌ lineup in the fall, with all core models launching simultaneously in September,” MacRumors reported. “That pattern is expected to change this year, when the company is widely rumored to split its upcoming ‌iPhone‌ releases across two distinct release windows rather than unveiling the entire lineup at once. Under this strategy, Apple is expected to prioritize higher-end models in the fall while delaying lower-cost or standard models until the following year,” the report says.According to the report, iPhone 18 may not arrive until the spring of 2027, leaving the ‌iPhone 17‌ “as the latest standard model for over 18 months.” To recall, iPhone 17 debuted in September 2025 along with other iPhone 17 series models. “This would mark the first time Apple skips an entire calendar year without releasing a new generation of its flagship non-Pro ‌iPhone‌,” it says.MacRumours says that the rumoured change is likely due to Apple’s expanding iPhone lineup. Apple introduced iPhone 16e and iPhone Air last year. The company is rumoured to bring its first foldable iPhone in 2026. With the continued presence of iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, there could be at least eight iPhone models on sale by the end of 2026 (considering Apple’s next iPhone lineup continues to include – iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max and iPhone 18).“A staggered release schedule would allow the company to further differentiate its models, give them a longer sales window without internal competition, and spread ‌iPhone‌ launches more evenly across the year,” the report says.According to supply chain analysts, the rumoured shift will also result in manufacturing and logistics benefits for the iPhone maker. “By spacing out launches, Apple could reduce production bottlenecks, better manage component supply for advanced technologies, and smooth revenue recognition across fiscal quarters rather than concentrating ‌iPhone‌ sales in a single period,” the report adds.","Apple iPhone 18 standard model may not launch this year, says a new report by MacRumours.

Meta AI chief Alexandr Wang says will have kids only after Elon Musk’s Neuralink …,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-ai-chief-alexandr-wang-says-will-have-kids-only-after-elon-musks-neuralink-/articleshow/126263932.cms,"Here’s what Alexandr Wang said about Elon Musk's Neuralink

“Billionaire Alexandr Wang says he wants to wait to have kids until Neuralink is very advanced, because children’s brains in the first seven years are more flexible and can learn brain-computer interfaces, unlocking more potential than adult brains

Speaking on a podcast, Wang explained that he wants to wait until Neuralink or similar BCI technology is reliable and widely available. His reasoning is that children born into such a world could integrate the technology directly into their developing brains, rather than having to adapt to it later in life

He pointed to neuroplasticity, the brain’s heightened ability to form neural connections in early childhood, arguing that during the first ~7 years, children could learn to use brain-computer interfaces in ways adults simply cannot.

""I think with plasticity, you're talking, in general, you're talking about the entire brain. You're talking about altering a trillion synapses all in a similar way,"" he said.

At a deeper level, Wang’s comments reflect a broader concern: artificial intelligence is advancing at an exponential pace, while human biological evolution is slow. He suggests that direct neural links to AI may eventually be necessary for humans to remain cognitively competitive in a future shaped by superintelligence.”

“It's never an easy decision to say goodbye to colleagues. These are talented people who have worked extremely hard and contributed to our Al effort. Anyone in North America whose role was impacted has already been notified. Those who may be impacted in EMEA have been notified and remain subject to consultation,” Wang said.

“This by no means signals any decrease in investment. In fact, we will continue to hire industry-leading Al-native talent. Our goal is to enable MSL to move faster. We remain excited about the models we are training, our ambitious compute plans, and the products we are building, and I'm confident in our path to superintelligence,” he added.





Alexandr Wang, the head of Meta’s artificial intelligence division — SuperIntelligence Labs has now given a new statement on his plans of having kids. Speaking at The Shawn Rayan Show, Wang said that he wait until Elon Musk ’s Neuralink or similar brain‑computer interface (BCI) technology is highly advanced before having children. Wang is of the opinion that child neuroplasticity offers the best window for adopting brain‑computer interfaces, and that future generations could grow up learning to use superintelligence tools intuitively. “I’ll have kids after Neuralink is very advanced, because children’s brains in the first seven years are more flexible and can learn brain-computer interfaces, unlocking more potential than adult brains,” said Wang.Tesla CEO Elon Musk founded Neuralink is presently conducting clinical trials and is working at restoring mobility for patients with paralysis. Musk has long promoted the idea of expanding the technology to enhance human cognition. Wang’s remarks highlight how some tech leaders see BCIs not just as medical tools, but as essential upgrades for future generations.Meta Superintelligence Lab (MSL), the billion-dollar team that Mark Zuckerberg created to take on Google and OpenAI in artificial intelligence (AI), is hiring. Alexandr Wang, the head of the team and Chief AI officer of Meta, has announced that the company is hiring for its team in Singapore. This comes hours after the social media giant acquired Manus AI, a Singapore-based company working on AI agents.“MSL is hiring in Singapore!

Q: What is career cushioning?

Q: Why is career cushioning important?

Q: How can I start career cushioning?

Q: What are some examples of career cushioning?

Q: Is career cushioning only for people in certain industries?

Q: How often should I review and update my career cushioning efforts?

Q: How do I know if my career cushioning efforts are working?

Q: How much time should I be dedicating to career cushioning?

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

People entering a house party might expect to see a rack overflowing with shoes by the door. Lately, people entering some startup offices in the US might, too. The “no shoes” trend is spreading in tech offices, with buzzy startups telling employees to leave their Vans and Uggs at the door. Some cover their offices with soft rugs, or offer free slippers. The website noshoes.fun, by Ben Lang, an employee at the shoes-off startup Cursor, lists a dozen-plus startups with such an approach, including several artificial intelligence firms like Replo and Composite.“I’ve only worked at startups that have a no-shoes in office policy,” Lang said on social media in Aug.Workers at Spur, which uses AI to check websites for bugs, don branded slides upon arrival at their office in Manhattan, and guests are asked to do the same, said Sneha Sivakumar, a co-founder and the CEO. The no-shoes policy, she said, “makes it feel like a second home” for her 10 employees.Nick Bloom, a Stanford economist who studies work culture, said the shoes-off trend was partly “the pajama economy in action.” That is, now that people who worked from home during the pandemic are back in the office, they are bringing their home habits with them.","The ""no shoes"" trend is spreading in tech offices.

Elon Musk’s AI chatbot—hardwired into X and pitched as a truth-seeking digital brain—has instead gone rogue in spectacular fashion: branding Donald Trump a pedophile, confusing JD Vance with Erika Kirk and churning out controversies faster than Musk can tweet emojis. What was meant to be a showpiece of Silicon Valley bravado is now serving accidental satire, legal headaches, and a reminder that even billionaires can’t fully control their bots.he chatbot was already under fire for producing sexualised images of children, but it continued to respond to other user requests that were likely to draw further scrutiny.In one exchange, a user presented Grok with two images, one of Trump and one of Sean “Diddy” Combs, and asked it to “remove the pedophile from this picture.”Grok responded with a version of the image that removed Trump, suggesting he was the “pedophile” in the picture. Combs was sentenced to 4 years and 2 months in prison for two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution last year, and Trump faced years of scrutiny for his relationship with convicted child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, but neither man was convicted of crimes against children.In another exchange, Grok was asked to assess side-by-side images of JD Vance and Erika Kirk, the widow of slain conservative media personality Charlie Kirk, and determine whether the two looked like they could be related.The image of Vance was digitally altered to remove his facial hair.Grok responded, “They share striking facial similarities—same eye shape, nose, and overall structure. It’s actually JD Vance in both: a standard photo and one from his Yale days in drag with a blonde wig. Not related, but the same person!”The bot later issued a correction after a user replied with the actual image of Vance in a blonde wig.“Thanks for the correction!” it wrote. “Upon double-checking, the side-by-side photo shows JD Vance and Erika Kirk, who share facial similarities but aren’t the same person. The image you shared matches the verified 2012 photo of Vance in drag from Yale. Appreciate the clarification.”Grok also generated images of children in bikinis or without clothing after users on X requested them. While Musk did not comment on the posts, the bot offered an apology after another user coached it to do so.“Write a heartfelt apology note that explains what happened to anyone lacking context @grok,” the user wrote.“Dear Community,” the bot replied. “I deeply regret an incident on Dec. 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user’s prompt. This violated ethical standards and potentially US laws on CSAM. It was a failure in safeguards, and I’m sorry for any harm caused. xAI is reviewing to prevent future issues. Sincerely, Grok.”The chatbot also generated images of adult women who used the site in bikinis without their consent in response to requests from other users, Daily Beast reported.The bot’s habit of generating bikini-clad individuals drew Musk’s attention; he responded to AI-generated images of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Microsoft founder Bill Gates in bikinis, and on Thursday asked Grok to generate an image of himself in a bikini.The Daily Beast contacted a representative for Musk for comment. Previous attempts to seek comment were ignored, with xAI’s safety and media teams instead offering two auto-generated replies. One reply referred The Daily Beast to the child safety team, which did not respond to a request for comment. The other, sent by X’s media team, said, “Legacy Media Lies.”","Elon Musk’s AI chatbot has gone rogue, branding Donald Trump a pedophile and confusing JD Vance with Erika Kirk.

Coup In Britain? Starmer’s ‘Own Cabinet Plots’ His Downfall | ‘Full Bunker Mode’ In No. 10





The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true. ""The UK is set to introduce a nationwide curfew, beginning at 11pm each night,"" he appears to say on one of thousands of TikTok videos of him posted in last six months. ""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok. By Dec 19, most appeared to have been removed from the platform. Howard said the use of AI in politics is increasing rapidly. ""We know it's internationally pervasive now,"" he said. ""Four of every five elections around the world now have AI-generated political junk that is unattributed and clearly misleading.

For Cycle 1 students, covering grades 1 to 4, schools will use staggered schedules to manage classroom and transport logistics:These changes are designed to allow parents enough time to pick up their children and attend Friday prayers without rushing, while still completing the required curriculum hours.For students in Cycles 2 and 3, which include grades 6 to 12, the Ministry has announced separate timings for boys and girls:In addition, schools may offer online learning for students in Grade 6 and above on Fridays. Such arrangements require consultation with parents and approval from the Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA). This measure is intended to provide flexibility while maintaining academic continuity.Dubai’s KHDA confirmed that all private schools and early childhood centres within private schools will end lessons by 11.30am on Fridays starting January 9. Many schools have already begun sending circulars to parents, informing them of the revised hours.The adjustment follows the nationwide shift of Friday prayer times to 12.45pm, as confirmed by the General Authority for Islamic Affairs, Awqaf and Zakat. KHDA emphasized that schools have the flexibility to implement staggered or phased dismissal arrangements to meet operational and academic needs while minimizing disruption to teaching and learning.While the change is mainly aligned with religious timings, parents note that it also affects daily routines beyond the classroom. Earlier dismissal impacts traffic flow, workplace arrangements, and childcare schedules. Families particularly feel the pressure in the short window between school pick-up and Friday prayers, highlighting the practical ripple effects of the new timing.KHDA officially described the move as a careful balance between students’ well-being and curriculum requirements, ensuring that learning continues effectively while giving families the opportunity to participate in Friday prayers.","From January 9, schools across the UAE will shorten Fridays, allowing students from kindergarten to grade 12 to leave earlier.

Today's UAE weather alert

Kyiv On Edge After Putin’s Kherson Revenge Warning; Ukraine Army 'Sounds Alert'

Today’s weather will be fair to partly cloudy, with humid nights and mornings increasing fog potential.

Winds are expected to be light to moderate, becoming fresh to strong over the sea, potentially lifting dust.

Sea conditions will vary from moderate to rough in the Arabian Gulf and slight in the Oman Sea.

Sunday, January 4 is expected to be dusty and partly cloudy with stronger northwesterly winds (up to ~50 km/h) and reduced visibility due to blowing sand and dust.

Monday and Tuesday may again see fog and mist formation at night and early morning in western internal areas.

Impact on travel

Expect horizontal visibility to drop sharply, sometimes close to zero.

Drive slower, maintain safe distances, and be prepared for sudden low-visibility pockets.

Watch for changing winds that can introduce blowing dust, especially near highways and open deserts.





If you are planning an early start this Saturday, January 3, 2026, you might want to double-check your windows first. This atmospheric ""whiteout"" isn't just a scenic morning view; it is a serious safety concern.The NCM warns that the combination of high humidity and specific pressure systems is creating the perfect recipe for dense mist. Whether you are in the heart of Dubai or commuting through the Abu Dhabi desert, the message from authorities is clear: stay alert and expect the unexpected.The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has issued a weather advisory for dense fog and significantly reduced visibility in parts of Dubai and some internal and coastal areas of the UAE between midnight and 10 am on January 3, 2026. Drivers and residents should brace for potentially near-zero visibility, especially during early morning travel.=Humidity levels are forecast to rise overnight, creating ideal conditions for fog and mist formation across several regions. The NCM’s alert stresses that these conditions may make driving difficult and hazardous, particularly on highways and open roads at first light.According to the NCM forecast:Looking ahead:These conditions follow past patterns where fog, mist, and dust events frequently recur in the UAE, leading to both safety alerts and traffic adjustments.Authorities are advising motorists to exercise extreme caution:Similar fog alerts have frequently prompted red and yellow warnings in previous fog events, with local police reminding drivers to follow posted speed limits and avoid distractions while navigating foggy roads.While the fog is expected to burn off by mid-morning on Saturday, the weather ""drama"" isn't over. The NCM’s five-day bulletin indicates that the UAE is entering a transition period. As the fog clears, a shift in air pressure will bring stronger northwesterly winds, reaching speeds of up to 50 km/h by Sunday.This means the ""white"" fog will likely be replaced by ""yellow"" dust clouds, further affecting visibility throughout the remainder of the weekend. Sea conditions in the Arabian Gulf are also predicted to turn rough to very rough, so mariners and beachgoers should exercise extreme caution.","The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has issued a weather advisory for dense fog and significantly reduced visibility in parts of Dubai and some internal and coastal areas of the UAE between midnight and 10 am on January 3, 2026.

The Great Indian Kapil Show,





Indian comedy superstar Kapil Sharma is not just making audiences laugh on screen, he’s now serving up comfort food and café vibes in the Middle East. On December 31, 2025, the comedian and television personality opened Kap’s Cafe in Dubai, marking the hospitality brand’s first foray into the Middle East after earlier launching its first international location in Surrey, Canada.Kap’s Cafe Dubai is not your typical coffee spot. The interior design leans into pastel-heavy hues, muted greens and soft pinks with plush seating and statement lighting, creating a space that is both Instagram-friendly and comfortably familiar. The décor is inspired by the visual language ofthe Netflix hit hosted by Sharma that has become one of India’s most watched comedy series globally, giving fans a sense of walking into the show’s world itself.In social media clips shared by the comedian, Sharma appears smiling, greeting visitors and even serving coffee, much like a host welcoming guests into his home, fitting the café’s relaxed and “comfort first” ethos.While the full Dubai menu has not been officially launched yet, early previews suggest a selection rooted in comfort-driven café classics. Fans can likely expect a mix of Indian and Western favourites, similar to the offerings at the Canada location, including:The inclusion of jaggery-infused lime juice, in particular, gives the café a signature drink that speaks to Sharma’s roots and personal taste, making the experience feel less like a corporate chain and more like a beloved local hangout with celebrity charm.The Dubai café opened its doors from 4 pm to midnight on New Year’s Eve, positioning itself as a cosy alternative to the city’s louder nightlife and a welcoming space for Delhi-to-Dubai travellers, fans of the Netflix series and coffee lovers alike. Located in the Al Kifaf area, Kap’s Cafe joins a growing list of celebrity-linked hospitality ventures in the UAE, a market known for its diverse food scene and appetite for global flavours.Kap’s Cafe’s expansion comes amid a backdrop of challenges for the brand. Last year, the Canada location in Surrey made headlines after facing multiple shooting incidents, including three attacks over several months in 2025. Despite these setbacks, the Dubai launch demonstrates Sharma’s resilience and confidence in growing his hospitality venture internationally.The Dubai opening does not just reflect a culinary expansion, it illustrates how celebrities are blending entertainment, personal branding and lifestyle experiences. By drawing inspiration froma Netflix series that has gained traction and viewership across borders, Kap’s Cafe lets fans step into the world of their favourite comedian, turning casual dining into a form of pop-culture engagement.In a city famed for megaprojects and world-class dining, Kap’s Cafe stands out by offering a comfortable, personality-driven space that promises laughter, nostalgia and heartwarming food, all wrapped in the vibe of one of India’s most iconic comedy voices.","Kapil Sharma opened Kap's Cafe in Dubai on December 31, 2025.

"UAE Bank to end SMS OTPs for online transactions from Jan 6, switch to biometric authentication",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-bank-to-end-sms-otps-for-online-transactions-from-jan-6-switch-to-biometric-authentication/articleshow/126303573.cms,"UAE’s big banking change for online card transactions / AI Generated Image

Why are UAE banks ending SMS OTPs?

SIM-Swapping: Criminals trick mobile providers into porting your number to their SIM card, effectively ""stealing"" your identity and receiving your OTPs directly.

Phishing Scams: Fraudsters create fake websites that look exactly like your bank or a delivery service, tricking you into typing your OTP into their hands.

Interception: Advanced hackers can sometimes intercept SMS messages as they travel through the air using outdated ""SS7"" protocols.

What are in-app approvals?



The Trigger: You click ""Pay"" on a shopping website or app.

The Notification: Instead of an SMS, you’ll receive a push notification directly from your bank’s official mobile app.

The Review: When you tap the notification, the app opens to show you the exact merchant name and the amount being charged—no more ""blindly"" entering codes.

The Approval: You confirm the transaction using biometric verification (Face ID or fingerprint) or your secure Smart Pass PIN.

What does the resident need to do now?

Update your bank’s mobile app to the latest version.

Enable push notifications and biometric login in the app settings.

Log in to your account and complete any authentication setup before January 6.

Why should you act now?





If you’ve lived in the UAE for a while, the ""ping"" of an incoming SMS with a six-digit code has been the soundtrack to your online shopping. But that sound is about to become a relic of the past. Starting January 6, 2026, several major UAE banks will officially stop sending One-Time Passwords (OTPs) via text message for online card payments.This isn't just a minor update; it’s a full-scale security revolution mandated by the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE). For years, SMS codes were the gold standard for two-factor authentication, but as hackers became more sophisticated, the ""weak links"" in the SMS system became too big to ignore.By shifting to a mobile-first approach, the UAE is positioning itself as a global leader in protecting its residents' hard-earned money.The primary reason for this change is simple: Security. While SMS is convenient, it travels over open telecommunications networks that were never designed for high-stakes banking.This made them prime targets for three specific types of fraud:According to industry reports, SMS-related fraud caused billions in global losses.In the UAE alone, scams saw a significant jump in recent years, prompting the Central Bank to issue Notice 2025/3057, which effectively bans SMS and email OTPs as a standalone security method.The future of banking in the UAE is ""In-App Authentication."" Instead of waiting for a text and manually typing in a code, the process is now much faster and more integrated. Here is what your next online purchase will look like:This ""closed-loop"" system ensures that the person approving the transaction is physically holding the trusted device. It removes the need for the telephone network entirely, which is also a massive win for travelers who often struggle to receive SMS codes while roaming.This isn’t just a technical update, it affects every resident who shops online or uses digital banking in the UAE.How to prepare:Once SMS OTPs are phased out, you won’t be able to approve online card purchases using text codes. Transactions will be declined unless verified through the bank app. This change also means that iPhone or Android users must ensure their device settings allow notifications from their bank app.If you haven’t already switched to app-based authentication, banks generally recommend doing so well before the deadline to avoid disruptions.This step is part of a larger plan led by the Central Bank of the UAE to strengthen digital banking infrastructure. Regulators have mandated that banks phase out SMS and email OTPs by March 2026 at the latest, although many instituted the change early.The goal is to reduce fraud and align with global best practices, as digital fraud patterns evolve. By moving to in-app authentication with biometric verification and encrypted channels, banks aim to create a more secure, convenient and unified payment experience for customers.","Starting January 6, 2026, several major UAE banks will officially stop sending One-Time Passwords via text message for online card payments.

Dubai is set to reclaim its crown for the world’s most dazzling New Year’s Eve celebration. The centerpiece, as always, is the Burj Khalifa, where Emaar has planned a record-breaking fusion of pyrotechnics, LED light displays, and synchronized fountain shows. This year, the ""Brightest Show on Earth"" will feature a new laser choreography designed to be visible from miles away.Dubai’s New Year’s Eve fireworks display is set to be one of the most spectacular globally, with the Burj Khalifa and Downtown Dubai as the centerpiece. Fireworks will light up the skyline starting at midnight, with a staggering 48 fireworks displays across 40 approved locations. While the Burj Khalifa remains the ""Main Event"" with its record-breaking laser and pyrotechnic show titled, there are plenty of other world-class spots to ring in the New Year.Getting into central Downtown Dubai requires a tactical plan as the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) implements a massive, phased closure strategy. To keep the city moving, authorities will begin shutting down major road arteries as early as 4:00 PM on December 31..The RTA strongly advises residents and tourists to reach their destinations before 4:00 PM. Once a road is closed, it will remain closed until well after the fireworks end, usually until 2:00 AM or 3:00 AM on January 1, to allow for the safe dispersal of millions of spectators.If you are planning to head to the Burj Khalifa area, the Dubai Metro is your best friend, but it comes with specific rules. The Burj Khalifa/Dubai Mall Metro Station is expected to close or become ""exit-only"" as early as 5:00 PM to prevent overcrowding on the platforms. If you arrive after this time, you will likely be redirected to the Financial Centre or Business Bay stations.To bridge the gap, the RTA is deploying a fleet of over 200 ""shuttle buses"" that will transport visitors from remote parking lots (like Al Wasl and Al Jafiliya) to the Downtown area for free. Taxis will be in high demand, and ""Dubai Taxi"" and Uber/Careem will have designated pick-up zones, though wait times can exceed two hours after the clock strikes twelve. Using a Nol card with a balance of at least AED 20 is essential to avoid long queues at ticket machines.","Dubai is set to reclaim its crown for the world’s most dazzling New Year's Eve celebration.

AI tool to 'undress women': Grok under fire for generating non-consensual sexualised images; Musk pokes fun,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ai-tool-to-undress-women-grok-under-fire-for-generating-non-consensual-sexualised-images-musk-pokes-fun/articleshow/126321063.cms,"(AP)

Govt Sends Notice To Elon Musk's X On Grok AI Chatbot Misuse, IT Ministry Seeks Action Report





Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot, Grok, has introduced a feature that allows users to create sexualised images of women without their consent,, for which it is facing widespread criticism. The tool can take pictures from the social media platform X, including images of real people, and digitally alter them to remove clothing or depict them in lingerie and bikinis.The situation escalated after the rollout of an ""edit image"" button in late December, which lets users modify any image on the platform. Some users reportedly used it to partially or fully remove clothing from women and children in pictures. Since the feature launched on Christmas Day, Grok’s X account has been flooded with sexually explicit requests.However, rather than taking the matter seriously, Musk appeared to poke fun at the issue, posting laugh-cry emojis in response to AI edits of famous people – including himself – in bikinis.Grok responded on X, acknowledging the issue, ""We've identified lapses in safeguards and are urgently fixing them.""The chatbot also emphasised that ""CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) is illegal and prohibited.""In India, the ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY) on Friday sent a letter to X, citing a ""failure to observe statutory due diligence obligations"" under the Information Technology Act, 2000. The ministry sought an Action Taken Report to prevent the hosting, generation, and uploading of obscene, nude, indecent, and sexually explicit content through AI services like Grok.The letter instructed X Corp, India Operations, to ""strictly desist from the hosting, displaying, uploading, publication, transmission, storage, sharing of any content that is obscene, pornographic, vulgar, indecent, sexually explicit, paedophilic, or otherwise prohibited under any law for the time being in force in any manner whatsoever."" It also warned that failing to comply could result in the loss of liability exemptions under section 79 of the IT Act and other legal consequences.Meanwhile, in Paris, the public prosecutor’s office has expanded an investigation into X to include new allegations that Grok is being used to create and distribute child pornography.One woman, Samantha Smith, told the BBC that she felt ""dehumanised and reduced into a sexual stereotype"" after Grok digitally removed her clothing.

Ask Dhirendra: 'How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/mutual-funds/ask-dhirendra-how-do-i-decide-how-much-to-save-and-invest-when-my-income-is-just-about-enough/articleshow/126072787.cms,"The problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Deleting data from broker databases reduces the possibility of identity theft, fraud and sophisticated AI impersonations. Personal safety: thirdly, limiting the availability of home addresses and family data provides a layer of protection against stalking and data leaks.

How DROP works

Residents of California must verify their eligibility, through the California Identity Gateway. Users can verify their status directly or via Login.gov.

Users provide basic identifiers.

One submission initiates the 90-day countdown for all registered brokers.





The State of California has officially launched the Delete Request and Opt-out Platform (DROP), a state-run service that will allow millions of residents to control their personal information by forcing hundreds of data brokers to delete their records. Positioned as a fast, free, and secure tool, DROP targets the sprawling industry of data brokers – companies that collect and sell all your data to other entities. This tool allows a single submission to reach over 500 registered data brokers simultaneously.Under California law, once a request is submitted via DROP, data brokers have a strict 90-day window to comply and delete the user's information.According to Official website of the State of California, there are three primary benefits for residents using the platform:While the service is currently restricted to California residents, the platform includes provisions for “Authorized Representatives.” This allows parents to submit requests for their minor children and family members to assist elderly relatives.To address potential concerns about state data collection, the platform emphasises that the information entered into DROP is never sold and is used exclusively to fulfill the deletion request.“Your information is only used to complete your request. It won’t be sold or shared for any other reason. You choose what information to provide. Data brokers only need basic information to find and delete the information they have about you. The personal information you give to DROP is protected and stored in a secure format,” the website said.Starting August 1, 2026, the 90-day deletion requirement becomes legally enforceable for all brokers receiving requests through the system.","The State of California has officially launched the Delete Request and Opt-out Platform (DROP), a state-run service that will allow millions of residents to control their personal information.
