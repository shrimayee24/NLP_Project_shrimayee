Donald Trump Rally: Neo-Nazi or no-Nazi? MAGA and libs duke it out over MSG rally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-elections-neo-nazi-or-no-nazi-maga-and-libs-duke-it-out-over-msg-rally/articleshow/114697635.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington:

The rally was enormous -- and raucous. Madison Square Gardens was filled to the rafters with 20,000 people, with thousands more outside. The speeches were fierce, vitriolic, and in some instances, racially loaded. Elon Musk , the world's richest man and MAGA's social media megaphone, introduced Melania Trump, making a rare campaign rally appearance; and she in turn introduced her husband, Donald Trump . For the MAGA faithful, the rally was a celebration of unity, the energy indicative of imminent victory.For many liberals, Democrats, and even moderate Republicans, it was a neo-Nazi gathering, scarily evocative of a 1939 rally when more than 20,000 supporters of Adolf Hitler packed into MSG for a so-called pro-America rally. Trump's own niece, Mary Trump, a fierce critic of the MAGA supremo, posted pictures of the 1939 and 2024 rallies side by side on X, wondering, ""So, we're really doing this again. Eyes wide open."" Kamala Harris' running mate Tim Walz noted: ""There’s a direct parallel to a big rally that happened in the mid-1930s at Madison Square Garden ... And don’t think that he doesn’t know for one second exactly what they’re doing there.""Liberal media channels ran images of the two events in tandem. Other critics called it a ""freak show"" ""a total embarrassment to the US"" and a ""hate rally."" Meghan McCain, daughter of late Republican Senator John McCain, wondered: ""I actually think this rally could backfire...This is maga on steroids.""MAGA principals pushed back, sneering at the comparison, pointing out that the rally included the group ""Jews for Trump,"" and Blacks, Latinos, and Hindus (including Trump acolyte Vivek Ramaswamy) spoke at the event. They pointed to a Star of David, a symbol of Jewish identity and Judaism, draped inside the auditorium. Elon Musk posted a meme on X with the caption, ""If he's Hitler why didn't he do Hitler things in the first term?""Just because he didn’t do it in the first term does not mean he will not in the second, countered liberals, arguing that he is now emboldened by the support he has got for proposals like internment camps, mass incarceration, and use of Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a law crafted in the early years of the republic when women and black had no voting rights. Trump himself ramped up his rhetoric, speaking of “an eye for an eye” (with reference to tariffs) and chuckling about a journalist critic who was (metaphorically) “decapitated” by his supporter on fake news NBC.Hours after the event, Elon Musk posted a photo of a black MAGA cap with the words MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. Critics noted that it used the Gothic-Fraktur typeface favored in Nazi Germany. “This font … is an homage to Nazi lettering. They are not hiding their Nazi love, anymore,” read one post on X, among several that raised alarm.","The rally was enormous -- and raucous.

Go to the official CIBIL website and click on 'Personal CIBIL score,' then 'Get Your Free CIBIL score.' Follow the link provided and fill in all the required details.2. If you don’t have a PAN Card, you can use an alternative identification such as Passport, Voter ID, Driver’s License, or Ration Card. Enter the number of the chosen ID.3.

Authenticate your identity by entering the OTP (One-Time Password) delivered to your mobile device on the next screen. Click 'Continue' to proceed.5.

Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

How to update KYC online

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Netflix is introducing a feature called “Moments” that will allow users to quickly save and revisit their favourite scenes from movies and shows, and even share them with friends. The feature is available now on iPhones and coming soon to Android , the company has announced.“Whether you’re replaying the intense final showdown in BEEF or a spooky twist in Wednesday, Moments lets you save and share it all. And with Season 2 of Squid Game coming on Dec. 26, it’s the perfect time to revisit those nail-biting game sequences from Season 1 and get ready for what’s next,” Netflix said.Moments lets users capture those scenes – which they feel have left a mark – with a simple tap, adding them to the “My Netflix” tab for easy access.For example, if you are watching Interstellar on Netflix on your phone and want to save the scene where Cooper and Dr Brand attempt to dock their aircraft to the Endurance spaceship. All users have to do is tap Moments at the bottom of the screen, and it’ll automatically save the scene to My Netflix tab.“You can revisit your Moments anytime on your phone, and if you rewatch the episode or film, it will start playing right from the scene you bookmarked,”Nexflix says.As far as sharing is concerned, Moments on Instagram , Facebook and other social platforms can be shared from the My Netflix tab by selecting a scene and tapping to share it across all of your platforms.The launch of Moments coincides with Netflix's new global brand campaign, ""It's So Good,"" featuring iconic moments and beloved celebrities like Cardi B, Simone Biles, and Giancarlo Esposito.Netflix says that it also plans to expand the Moments feature in the future, offering even more ways for users to engage with their favourite content and share their passion with others.","Netflix is introducing a feature called “Moments’ that will allow users to quickly save and revisit their favourite scenes from movies and shows.

How NotebookLlama works

Facebook parent Meta has released an AI tool that can create a PDF-to-podcast workflow, meaning it can transform PDFs into podcasts with this easy-to-follow guide. This capability, called NotebookLlama , is similar to Google ’s NotebookLM .However, there is one big difference: NotebookLlama is “an Open Source version of NotebookLM” which means any developer can access, modify, and distribute the source code and related materials.NotebookLlama is an AI-powered tool that can transform a PDF document, like a news article or blog post, into a podcast-style script. According to the explanation on the tool’s github page, it does transform raw content by first creating a text transcript of the PDF and then adding elements like dramatic pauses and interruptions to make it sound more like a natural conversation. This enhanced script is then fed into text-to-speech models to generate the final audio output.Meta researchers say that the current quality of the generated podcast depends heavily on the capabilities of the text-to-speech models, and believe that using more advanced models may significantly improve the naturalness and expressiveness of the generated speech.“The text-to-speech model is the limitation of how natural this will sound,” NotebookLlama’s GitHub page says.Furthermore, they suggest that an even more engaging podcast could be created by using two AI agents to ""debate"" the topic and generate a more dynamic and interactive script.“...another approach of writing the podcast would be having two agents debate the topic of interest and write the podcast outline. Right now we use a single model to write the podcast outline,” it added.Google’s NotebookLM also allows users to upload PDFs, websites, YouTube videos, audio files, Google Docs, or Google Slides and it summarises them to “make interesting connections between topics, all powered by Gemini 1.5’s multimodal understanding capabilities.”","NotebookLlama is an AI-powered tool that can transform a PDF document, like a news article or blog post, into a podcast-style script.

Apple is offering developers new tools to analyse PCC security



Apple is inviting security researchers to investigate its Private Cloud Compute (PCC) system, which powers its Apple Intelligence feature. To demonstrate the security and privacy of its artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, the tech giant is offering rewards of up to $1 million for discovering vulnerabilities in the PCC system.While Apple emphasises that many Apple Intelligence features run on-device, more demanding tasks are processed on PCC servers. These servers, built with Apple Silicon and a new operating system, are designed to uphold Apple's commitment to user privacy. To ensure transparency and independent verification, Apple is opening up the PCC to scrutiny from security researchers.In a blog post, Apple has confirmed that researchers who discover flaws that compromise the security and privacy of PCC can now earn bounties comparable to those offered for iOS vulnerabilities, with the highest payouts for vulnerabilities that expose user data outside the PCC's secure environment. Here are the bounty amounts:The new bounty categories focus on critical threats like accidental data disclosure, external compromise through user requests, and vulnerabilities related to physical or internal access. This initiative underscores Apple's commitment to the security and privacy of its AI infrastructure and encourages researchers to help identify and address potential vulnerabilities.Apart from this, Apple will also consider any security issue that has a significant impact on PCC for an Apple Security Bounty reward, even if it doesn’t match a published category. The company will “evaluate every report according to the quality of what's presented, the proof of what can be exploited, and the impact on users.”In its blog post, Apple confirmed about creating a Virtual Research Environment (VRE) for security researchers to analyse the Private Cloud Compute (PCC) system used for Apple Intelligence. This will allow for independent verification of Apple's privacy claims and in-depth investigation of PCC software, including the Secure Enclave Processor, through tools for inspecting releases, verifying logs, booting in a virtual environment, and debugging.To access the Private Cloud Compute Virtual Research Environment, developers will need a Mac with Apple silicon and at least 16GB of unified memory running the macOS Sequoia 15.1 Developer Preview. Detailed instructions on how to get started are available on Apple's developer website.","Apple is inviting security researchers to investigate its Private Cloud Compute (PCC) system, which powers its Apple Intelligence feature.

Victims face challenges as Apple support operates only during weekdays.

Engineers files FIR with cyber crime police

A Bengaluru-based techie fell victim to an online gift card scam recently, losing Rs 4.5 lakh. As per a Money Control report, the fraud started when the engineer received a Diwali gift message on WhatsApp, allegedly from his boss. “I am currently engaged in a conference call meeting and I need you to run a quick assignment. We need to provide our clients in India with some gift cards, can you confirm if we can get apple app store cards from Paytm…,” read the WhatsApp message received on October 13.Willing to make a good impression, the engineer, who was also a fresh recruit, purchased the vouchers that cost him Rs 4.35 lakh. Consequently, he shared the voucher codes as instructed. He realised he’d been duped when he casually mentioned the “gift request” to his HR department, only to find out it hadn’t come from his real boss at all.The engineer, as per the report, filed an FIR at Bellandur Cyber Crime branch the next day. Police have started investigating the case, warning others to be cautious of similar scams.The victim told the publication “Apple's customer support operates only Monday to Friday from 9am to 6pm, which significantly limits victims’ ability to seek timely assistance. I couldn’t get the IDs blocked or get any respite immediately in recovering the misused funds and had to wait till morning for Apple support to open”.","Engineers files FIR with cyber crime police after losing Rs 4.5 lakh in a gift card scam.

Why Microsoft Teams users globally must be careful when contacted by their company’s ‘IT staff’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-microsoft-teams-users-globally-must-be-careful-when-contacted-by-their-companys-it-staff/articleshow/114659676.cms,"How Black Basta hacking group works

Hackers are exploiting Microsoft Teams to launch sophisticated ransomware attacks against corporations globally. In a new wave of cyberattacks , criminals are impersonating corporate help desk staff to trick employees into installing malicious software , ultimately deploying the BlackBasta ransomware.According to a report by US-based cybersecurity company ReliaQuest (via Bleeping Computer), Black Basta is a ransomware operation that has been active since April 2022. The group is said to be one of the branches of the disbanded Conti cybercrime syndicate that was shut down in June 2022.Black Basta members breach corporate networks through various methods, including vulnerabilities, partnering wish malware botnets and social engineering .Previously, BlackBasta group used to flood employees' inboxes with non-malicious emails and then pose as IT help desk staff over the phone to offer assistance over ‘ongoing’ cyber attack’. The employee contacted would then be tricked into installing remote access tools like AnyDesk or enabling Windows Quick Assist, giving the attackers access to the network.Now, instead of phone calls, the attackers are utilising Microsoft Teams to contact employees. They impersonate IT help desk personnel through external user accounts with deceptive display names like “Help Desk.”""These external users set their profiles to a 'DisplayName' designed to make the targeted user think they were communicating with a help-desk account,"" the report says.""In almost all instances we've observed, the display name included the string 'Help Desk,' often surrounded by whitespace characters, which is likely to center the name within the chat. We also observed that, typically, targeted users were added to a 'OneOnOne' chat,"" it added.They also create a convincing illusion of legitimacy, leading employees to believe they are interacting with internal support staff. Once the contact is established, the attackers then trick employees into installing remote access tools or enabling Quick Assist, eventually having access to the company system.","Hackers are exploiting Microsoft Teams to launch sophisticated ransomware attacks against corporations globally.
