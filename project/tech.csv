They are more than just brushstrokes or oil on canvas.From the enigmatic smile of the Mona Lisa to the haunting Scream by Edvard Munch, and the ethereal beauty of Shakuntala by Raja Ravi Verma, each painting reveals deeper meanings, symbolising the artist’s emotions, societal changes, and the conflicts of their time.Discover the fascinating stories behind these iconic works that have made a solid impact on the world of art here.The enigmatic smile of the Mona Lisa has fascinated viewers for centuries.

The painting’s mysterious expression, use of sfumato technique, and its theft in 1911 have only increased its fame.The Starry Night depicts a swirling night sky over a quiet town, capturing Van Gogh’s emotional turmoil. Painted in 1889 from the window of a mental asylum, it reflects his battle with mental illness. The painting’s vibrant brushstrokes and dreamlike quality make it one of the most iconic artworks ever.Painted between 1495 and 1498, The Last Supper portrays Jesus and his disciples during the moment of betrayal. Located in Milan’s Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie, it showcases Da Vinci’s innovative use of perspective and human emotion. Restoration efforts over the centuries have struggled to preserve its original grandeur.Shakuntala depicts the beautiful heroine from Kalidasa’s epic, Abhijñānaśākuntalam. Raja Ravi Varma captures her essence with delicate brushwork, showcasing her deep emotional connection with nature and the divine. The painting conveys a poignant moment of longing, emphasising the themes of love, fate, and the transient nature of beauty.Created in 1931, The Persistence of Memory is known for its melting clocks, symbolising the fluidity of time. Dalí’s surrealist masterpiece explores themes of dreams and the subconscious. Its bizarre yet captivating imagery has made it one of the most recognizable works in modern art history.Often referred to as the ""Mona Lisa of the North,"" Girl with a Pearl Earring (1665) features a young girl in a turban with a luminous pearl earring. Painted by Dutch artist Vermeer, its simplicity, use of light, and the subject's gaze evoke intrigue and mystery, capturing timeless beauty.Guernica (1937) is Picasso's powerful anti-war statement, depicting the horrors of the Spanish Civil War. The monochromatic, chaotic composition was inspired by the bombing of the town of Guernica. The painting’s distorted figures and intense emotion make it one of the most famous political artworks of the 20th century.Edvard Munch’s The Scream (1893) embodies human anxiety and existential dread. Inspired by a panic attack the artist experienced, its swirling sky and distorted figure reflect inner turmoil. The painting’s haunting expression and bold colours have cemented it as a symbol of modern emotional experience and psychological depth.In Bharat Mata, Abanindranath Tagore presents India as a goddess, symbolising the nation’s unity and strength. Draped in a saffron sari and holding a book, a sheaf of rice, and a mala, she embodies knowledge, prosperity, and spirituality. This painting became a powerful symbol of the Indian independence movement.The Night Watch (1642) is Rembrandt’s grand depiction of a militia company, praised for its dynamic composition and use of light. Once considered a night scene due to dark varnish, later restorations revealed it as a daytime setting. Its scale and intricate details showcase Rembrandt’s mastery of portraiture.Bride’s Toilet portrays the intimate moment of an Indian bride’s preparation, capturing the beauty and vulnerability of the ritual. Painted in 1937, Sher-Gil’s uses rich colours and expressive forms to depict the emotions of anticipation and femininity.American Gothic (1930) by Grant Wood depicts a stern farmer and his daughter, set against a rural backdrop. It has become a symbol of American rural life, though its meaning is debated. Some interpret it as a critique of small-town life, while others see it as a celebration of Midwestern values.Painted in the 1480s, The Birth of Venus depicts the Roman goddess Venus emerging from the sea. Botticelli's delicate use of colour and graceful figures evoke beauty and myth. Commissioned by the powerful Medici family, this Renaissance masterpiece has become an enduring symbol of classical beauty and humanism.Horses showcases M.F. Husain’s fascination with these majestic animals, which he often used as metaphors for freedom and energy. The vibrant colours and dynamic brushstrokes convey a sense of movement and vitality. This artwork reflects Husain's modernist approach, blending traditional Indian themes with contemporary artistic expression.Three Pujarins exemplifies Jamini Roy's unique style, blending traditional Indian folk art with modern aesthetics. The painting features three women engaged in ritualistic worship, adorned in vibrant colours and patterns. Roy’s emphasis on simplicity and expressive forms highlights the cultural richness of Indian traditions, celebrating the beauty of everyday life.","Discover the fascinating stories behind these iconic works that have made a solid impact on the world of art.

Diddy: 'We’re getting Diddy freaky tonight': Landon Barker slammed for baby oil theme at birthday party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/were-getting-diddy-freaky-tonight-landon-barker-slammed-for-baby-oil-party-theme/articleshow/114177323.cms,"Landon Barker and Sean 'Diddy' Combs

American musician Landon Barker has come under fire for attending a party that mocked the serious sexual assault allegations against Sean “Diddy” Combs. The backlash follows Barker’s 21st birthday celebration at Nobu Malibu, after which he headed to a friend's birthday bash at a Los Angeles club.Clips from the event surfaced online, showing servers delivering bottles of baby oil adorned with flashing lights—a reference to the thousands of bottles seized from Diddy ’s homes earlier this year.While some partygoers laughed at the reference, the “bottle girls” serving the drinks appeared uncomfortable with the situation. One attendee captioned a video, “Baby oil show for the bday boy loolololol.”Although guests began passing the bottles around, Barker was not seen participating and seemed somewhat uneasy about the entire affair. In another clip, a DJ announced, “We’re getting really freaky tonight. We’re getting Diddy freaky tonight"", as quoted by PageSixDiddy is currently under investigation for his alleged “Freak Off” parties, where he reportedly subjected victims to physical, emotional, and verbal abuse during substance-fuelled sex parties.Videos from the party quickly went viral, sparking outrage among viewers who called the theme “insensitive and gross.” One user said, “Does anyone think it’s weird af for rich/famous people to make a potential sex trafficking party ring (idk the deets sorry) an ongoing joke at their own parties?” Another user commented, “I’ve never seen something so uncouth and unclassy in all my days.” A third added, “this is disrespectful to the victims.”Numerous accusations of sexual assault against Diddy have emerged in recent months. In one upcoming lawsuit, a woman alleges that Combs doused her with drug-infused oil before raping her alongside his bodyguard. Ariel Mitchell-Kidd, an attorney for several accusers, shared “graphic” details of her client’s alleged assault, claiming Diddy threatened her with a knife and used an oil-like substance believed to contain a date rape drug.54-year-old rapper Diddy was arrested last month on multiple charges, including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. He has pleaded not guilty to these charges, and his bail requests have been denied several times. He is expected to remain in custody in Brooklyn , NY, until his trial, which is scheduled to begin on May 5, 2025.","Landon Barker attended a party that mocked the serious sexual assault allegations against Sean ""Diddy"" Combs.

She expressed her shock at being contacted by a man she had never met, as reported by PEOPLE.“I’m at the airport, and the creepiest thing just happened to me,” she explained while walking through the terminal.She then showed a screenshot of the message, which began, “Hi Kristen,” despite her name being Kirsten. The text continued: “My name is Nate. I saw you and thought you were so beautiful so I had to find a way to talk to you. I saw your number on your luggage tag and decided to text you. I promise this isn’t as weird as it seems! Give a guy a chance?”Kirsten was taken aback. “First of all, he spelled my name wrong. Second of all, if he wanted to talk to me so badly, why didn’t he come up and talk to me like a normal human being?” she said. “This just feels like such an invasion of privacy.”Kirsten became more concerned when she realised the stranger might have access to more personal information. “I’m extra weirded out because I have my address on my luggage tag, so he could potentially know where I live now,” she said.Kirsten concluded her video with advice for fellow travellers: “PSA to everyone out there: Turn your luggage tag inside out so that your personal information isn’t visible.”The incident sparked concern among her followers, with one user commenting, “My jaw literally dropped. I’m horrified.” Others shared similar experiences and recommended using luggage tags with covers to protect personal details.",Kirsten shared the incident on TikTok while waiting during her layover.

Exploding Pagers: How Israel’s Mossad convinced Hezbollah to buy its exploding pagers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/how-israels-mossad-convinced-hezbollah-to-buy-its-exploding-pagers/articleshow/113980318.cms,"In a covert operation by Israel's Mossad , Hezbollah was convinced to purchase and distribute pagers to thousands of its operatives. The scheme was designed to infiltrate the group's communication system, ultimately leading to the deaths and injuries of many members.The story began two years ago when Mossad devised a plan to use pagers as a Trojan horse to penetrate Hezbollah's network.The device in question, the AR924 pager , appeared to be an ideal tool for a militia group like Hezbollah. It was rugged, waterproof, and came with an oversized battery capable of lasting months without needing a recharge. The pagers were marketed as being immune to Israeli tracking, which appealed greatly to Hezbollah’s leaders, who were always wary of Israeli intelligence monitoring their communications.Follow: Live updates on Israel Hezbollah war In early 2023, Hezbollah made a bulk purchase of these pagers, convinced of their reliability. The devices were distributed to mid-level fighters and support personnel across Lebanon and Syria . What Hezbollah didn’t realise was that Mossad had designed the pagers themselves. Hidden within the battery pack of each device was a powerful explosive, which could be triggered remotely by Mossad or activated through a two-step process. The latter option involved pressing two buttons to decrypt messages, meaning the user would likely be holding the device with both hands when it detonated.On September 17, thousands of these pagers exploded simultaneously, killing or maiming an estimated 3,000 Hezbollah officers, fighters, and civilians. The operation is considered one of the most audacious and effective pieces of spycraft in recent history.Read more: How Israel's Mossad turned everyday pagers into deadly weapons against Hezbollah The plan originated in 2022 when Mossad, tasked with combating foreign threats to Israel, sought new ways to infiltrate Hezbollah, which had grown increasingly sophisticated in its communications.The organisation was desperate to avoid Israeli surveillance, and Mossad capitalised on this paranoia by offering Hezbollah what seemed to be secure, untraceable communication devices.To ensure the plan’s success, Mossad had to conceal the origins of the pagers. The devices were branded as Taiwanese and sold through a marketing official who had no knowledge of the true intent behind the sales. Hezbollah had been successfully misled into buying and distributing what were essentially bombs designed by their enemy.The first part of Mossad's pager plot was triggered on September 17. Explosions occurred simultaneously across Lebanon and Syria as Hezbollah operatives attempted to access encrypted messages. The two-step decryption process, which required both hands, ensured maximum casualties as fighters were directly exposed to the blasts. A day later, Mossad remotely triggered walkie-talkies that had been similarly booby-trapped, further adding to the chaos.This operation resulted in devastating consequences for Hezbollah, severely damaging its leadership and disrupting its communication networks. Israel followed up with airstrikes on Hezbollah’s key military infrastructure, intensifying the group's vulnerability. Despite the success of this operation, it also led to heightened tensions in the region, with Hezbollah and its backers, including Iran, retaliating and threatening further escalation.The attack is seen as a turning point in Israel’s ongoing conflict with Hezbollah, demonstrating the lengths Mossad is willing to go to neutralise threats and highlighting the profound risks of modern spycraft.","Israel's Mossad devised a plan to use pagers as a Trojan horse to penetrate Hezbollah's network.

The pink is due to a genetic mutation.""With infectious enthusiasm, Jamie explains the rarity of this encounter, noting that only 1% of people may have the chance to witness such a phenomenon in their lifetime.She goes on to reveal the scientific reason behind the grasshopper's unique coloration, attributing it to a genetic mutation that causes an overproduction of pink pigment and an underproduction of black.''Wow, I just found a pink grasshopper. There's like 1% of people can see pink grasshoppers in their lifetime. So, I am so lucky to be able to see it.

Known as the aurora borealis , the light show captivated stargazers from Scotland to East Anglia, with images of the breathtaking phenomenon flooding social media.The solar storm lit up skies across several US states, offering rare views of the northern lights.The stunning auroras were visible in places such as the Eastern Sierra mountains in California, Lewes in Delaware, St. Joseph by Lake Michigan, Falmouth in Maine, and even as far south as Shenandoah National Park in Virginia.The Met Office had predicted that the auroras might only be visible as far south as the Midlands. However, the spectacle extended further south, offering a rare opportunity for people to witness the phenomenon. In the US, parts of the northern states also experienced the dazzling light show.The display is the result of a powerful solar eruption that has sent charged particles from the sun hurtling towards Earth. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) had earlier issued a G4 geomagnetic storm watch, one of the most severe classifications. This storm, expected to hit Earth on Thursday, allows the Northern Lights to be seen far beyond their usual range. NOAA has been monitoring the coronal mass ejection, which could cause minor disruptions to power grids, GPS, and satellite communications.The aurora borealis occurs when these charged solar particles collide with Earth's magnetic field, exciting gases in the atmosphere. This interaction produces the vibrant colours seen in the night sky, with green hues being the most common, caused by oxygen in the atmosphere.For those hoping to capture the auroras, experts recommend using long exposure photography, as the lights are not always clearly visible to the naked eye.","The Northern Lights have illuminated the skies over the UK and parts of the US.

Ranging from 300 to 900, a higher score indicates a stronger likelihood of loan approval. Banks and financial institutions use this score to assess the risk associated with lending money.1. Go to the official CIBIL website and click on 'Personal CIBIL score,' then 'Get Your Free CIBIL score.' Follow the link provided and fill in all the required details.2. If you don’t have a PAN Card, you can use an alternative identification such as Passport, Voter ID, Driver’s License, or Ration Card. Enter the number of the chosen ID.3. Provide your date of birth, PIN code, and select your state. Finally, enter your mobile number and click on ‘Accept and Continue’.4. Authenticate your identity by entering the OTP (One-Time Password) delivered to your mobile device on the next screen. Click 'Continue' to proceed.5.

Upon successful registration, you will see a page confirming that 'You have successfully registered!'7. Click on ‘Go to Dashboard’ to access and view your CIBIL score.The factors influencing the new CIBIL score, as stated on the CIBIL website, include:1. Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5. Number of new accounts opened and number of accounts closed: Opening or closing accounts can affect your score, so managing these actions wisely is important.","Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

How this attack affected users



Users in multiple cities face similar issues



What the company said



Multiple Ecovacs Deebot X2 robot vacuums in US cities were recently hacked. This allowed attackers to remotely control the devices and broadcast racial slurs through their built-in speakers. This incident follows a report by the ABC, which demonstrated a critical security flaw in the Chinese-made robot vacuum model. The hackers exploited this vulnerability to gain unauthorised access to the Deebot X2s, enabling them to manipulate the vacuums' movements and utilise the speakers for malicious purposes.""It sounded like a broken-up radio signal or something. You could hear snippets of maybe a voice,” Minnesota lawyer Daniel Swenson said to ABC News. He said was watching TV when his robot vacuum started to malfunction.After resetting the device, the vacuum began moving on its own and broadcasting racist slurs through its speaker, exposing the family to hateful content. This incident highlights the serious privacy and security risks associated with smart home devices .""I got the impression it was a kid, maybe a teenager [speaking]. Maybe they were just jumping from device to device messing with families,” Swenson said.He also added that it could have been much worse as the attackers could’ve decided to quietly observe his family inside their home. The hackers could have easily spied on the family through the compromised robot vacuum, accessing its camera and microphone without their knowledge or consent. Finally, the device was taken to the garage and wasn’t switched on again.Multiple Ecovacs Deebot X2 robot vacuums in the US were reportedly hacked within days of each other. The attackers remotely controlled the vacuums, harassed pets, and yelled racist slurs through the speakers. These incidents follow an ABC News report that revealed security flaws in the Deebot X2, including a faulty PIN code system and the ability to disable the camera warning sound. Hackers could potentially access the camera and microphone without the owner's knowledge.Despite multiple reports of similar incidents, Ecovacs initially appeared dismissive of Daniel Swenson's complaint about his hacked robot vacuum. The company later conducted a ""security investigation"" and claimed that Swenson's account was likely compromised through a "" credential stuffing "" attack, where login credentials reused across multiple websites are stolen from a different platform. Ecovacs maintains that there is no evidence of a breach within their systems.","Multiple Ecovacs Deebot X2 robot vacuums in the US were reportedly hacked within days of each other.

How does it work?

Phishing: Scammers often use phishing emails or calls to impersonate legitimate organizations like banks, e-commerce websites, or service providers.

Tricking the victim: They create a sense of urgency, claiming that there's a suspicious activity on their account or a need for immediate verification.

Requesting OTP: The victim is then asked to share their OTP, which the scammer uses to access their account and steal money or personal information .



How to Stay Safe from OTP Scams

Be cautious of unsolicited calls and emails: Never share personal information or OTPs with anyone who contacts you unexpectedly.

Verify the sender: Before clicking on any links or replying to emails, double-check the sender's address and look for any signs of phishing, such as poor grammar or unusual requests.

Never share OTPs: Remember that legitimate organizations will never ask you to share your OTP over the phone or email.

Use strong passwords: Create complex passwords for your online accounts and enable two-factor authentication whenever possible.

Report scams: If you believe you've been a victim of an OTP scam, report it to the relevant authorities and your bank or service provider immediately.

With the growing influence of generative AI , India's quick commerce platforms are increasingly incorporating AI technology to enhance customer experiences and improve personalization. By deploying AI-driven tools, platforms such as Zomato , Swiggy , and BlinkIt have streamlined product recommendations, optimised delivery routes, and introduced virtual assistants to simplify user interactions.These advancements improve operational efficiency and cater to individual preferences. However, the adoption of AI also presents significant challenges, including high implementation costs and concerns surrounding data privacy, which these platforms must navigate while expanding their technological capabilities.Zomato introduced a personalised AI food assistant, available initially for Zomato Gold members. The AI assistant provides tailored restaurant and dish recommendations based on user preferences. It can answer specific queries, such as ""What should I eat when I’m hungover?"" or suggest low-carb, high-protein meals. Zomato's AI stack is built on OpenAI’s large language models (LLMs) and is powered through Microsoft Azure. Additionally, Zomato uses AI on the backend to optimise delivery times and improve customer support.However, Zomato has taken a firm stance against AI-generated content for restaurants, banning the use of AI-generated images in menus and promotional materials. The company has developed tools to detect such content, warning restaurants of removal if they fail to comply.BlinkIt, Zomato’s quick commerce arm, rolled out an AI-driven feature called ""Recipe Rover"" in May 2023. This tool helps users discover recipes and simplifies meal planning by offering curated recipe suggestions based on special occasions, such as Ganesh Utsav. The recipes also provide macro-nutrient information, making meal planning more health-conscious. Powered by Midjourney and OpenAI’s GPT models, Recipe Rover helps users not only find recipes but also directly source the ingredients needed.Swiggy launched its own AI-powered recommendation tool, ‘What to Eat,’ which personalises food suggestions based on user mood, past orders, and trending dishes. The neural search engine developed by Swiggy offers users transparency, explaining why specific recommendations are made. Swiggy plans to enhance this feature with voice-based and multi-language support, making it accessible across various regions of India.Swiggy is also focusing on optimising its operations through AI, with AI-powered route optimization for delivery agents. The company plans to introduce an AI chatbot to assist users within Dineout, as well as an AI-powered bot for restaurant partners to address onboarding and other operational concerns.Myntra, a leading fashion e-commerce platform, launched MyFashionGPT in partnership with Microsoft. This AI assistant goes beyond conventional keyword searches, allowing users to ask open-ended queries like ""Show me clothes for a beach vacation"" and receiving suggestions spanning multiple categories. Myntra has also introduced Maya, an AI fashion influencer, to enhance customer engagement.Myntra continues to experiment with generative AI for customer support and creative automation. Upcoming AI capabilities include full outfit previews and enhanced voice search functionalities.
