Apple is reportedly planning to roll out the iOS 26.1 update soon. While the official release date is not known yet, online rumours suggest that the upcoming iOS update may be introduced in early November. With the iOS 26.1 update, Apple is expected to bring a host of new features that may include an all-new Liquid Glass toggle, lock screen toggle, sony swipes in Apple Music and more. Here’s what we know about the iOS 26.1 so far – expected release date and features as rumoured online.Apple is yet to announce an iOS 26.1 Release Candidate – considered to be the final beta version before the wider rollout. Previous rumours hinted that the final beta of iOS 26.1 may be released in October. But it is now expected to come next month. In this case, iOS 26.1 is likely to be released next week with November 3 or November 4 as the expected dates.Apple has added a new customization option for the Liquid Glass interface in iOS 26.1.Users can now choose between two display styles under Settings → Display and Brightness → Liquid Glass — a more transparent Clear look or a slightly opaque Tinted one.A new setting under Settings → Lock Screen introduces the option to disable the quick swipe gesture that opens the Camera app. The toggle, labeled “Lock Screen Swipe to Open Camera,” prevents accidental camera launches when swiping left on the Lock Screen.The Clock app has received a small but meaningful usability tweak. Instead of a single Stop button, iOS 26.1 introduces a new “slide to stop” gesture for turning off alarms and timers.This reduces the chance of accidentally dismissing alarms — an issue that emerged after Apple enlarged the stop button in earlier iOS 26 builds.iOS 26.1 brings a smoother music experience with song swiping in the Apple Music player. Users can now swipe left or right to skip tracks directly from the player interface.Following Apple’s recent announcement, iOS 26.1 incorporates the company’s new branding for its streaming service. Apple TV+ is now renamed Apple TV, featuring a more colorful app icon that reflects its “vibrant new identity.”Apple Intelligence expands its multilingual support with the addition of Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, Portuguese (Portugal), Swedish, Turkish, Chinese (Traditional), and Vietnamese.This update makes Apple’s AI-driven features accessible to a wider global audience.The AirPods Live Translation feature now supports additional languages including Japanese, Korean, Italian, and both Traditional and Simplified Chinese.The feature is available on AirPods 4 with ANC, AirPods Pro 2, and AirPods Pro 3.Apple has introduced a new security feature under Settings → Privacy & Security → Security Improvements that automatically downloads and installs Background Security Improvements.These patches act as interim updates between major iOS releases, replacing the earlier Rapid Security Response mechanism to ensure faster protection against emerging threats.","iOS 26.1 is expected to be released next week with November 3 or November 4 as the expected dates.

OpenAI to offer ChatGPT Go subscription free to all users across India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openai-to-offer-chatgpt-go-subscription-free-to-all-users-across-india/articleshow/124864883.cms,"OpenAI's Master Plan for India





In a major push to consolidate its presence in the Indian market, OpenAI has announced that it will offer ChatGPT Go free to all users in India starting November 4. For the uninitiated, ChatGPT Go is OpenAI's mid-tier subscription plan for its AI chatbot ChatGPT. The move targets India, which the company identifies as its second-largest and fastest-growing global market. The year-long complimentary access to ChatGPT Go comes as a direct response to similar aggressive user acquisition tactics by rivals Google and Perplexity. Both companies recently waived fees for their premium AI features to appeal to the vast Indian consumer base.OpenAI's decision follows Google's move to make its AI Pro membership, priced at Rs 19,500$, free for students for a year. Similarly, Perplexity partnered with telecom giant Airtel to offer free access to its premium plan, intensifying the battle for AI market share in the country.ChatGPT Go, which initially launched in India in August at an affordable monthly price of Rs 399, was designed as a bridge between the free tier and the more expensive ChatGPT Plus subscription. The free ChatGPT Go tier will provide Indian users with significant benefits, including: Higher message limits; Increased daily image generation and uploads; Longer memory for more personalized and context-aware responses"".Since launching ChatGPT Go in India a few months ago, the adoption and creativity we've seen from users has been inspiring,"" said Nick Turley, Vice President and Head of ChatGPT, in a statement. ""Ahead of our first DevDay Exchange event in India, we’re making ChatGPT Go freely available for a year to help more people across India access and benefit from advanced AI.""OpenAI founder and CEO Sam Altman recently highlighted that India is not only the company’s second-largest market but also its fastest-growing. The company noted that since the introduction of the paid ChatGPT Go tier, its overall paid subscriptions in India have more than doubled, underscoring the demand for advanced AI services. The Go plan has since expanded its reach to nearly 90 markets worldwide.","ChatGPT Go is OpenAI's mid-tier subscription plan for its AI chatbot ChatGPT.

Confronted with allegations that they had cheated in an introductory data science course and fudged their attendance, dozens of undergraduates at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign recently sent two professors a mea culpa via email. But there was one problem, a glaring one: They had not written the emails. Artificial intelligence had, according to the professors, Karle Flanagan and Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider, an academic pair known to their students and social media followers as the Data Science Duo.The students got their comeuppance in a large lecture hall on Oct 17, when the professors read aloud their identical, less-than-genuine apologies from a projector screen, video from that class showed.

""And I was like, Thank you. They're owning up to it. They're apologising. And then I got another email, the second email, and then the third. And then everybody sort of sincerely apologising, and suddenly it became a little less sincere.""At a time when educational institutions are grappling with the intrusion of machine learning into classrooms and homework assignments, the university professors said they decided to use the episode to teach a lesson in academic integrity. They did not take disciplinary action against the students. ""You can hear the students laugh in the background of the video,"" Professor Fagen-Ulmschneider said. ""They very well knew that it was something that they could see themselves doing. ""Although the university's student code covers cheating and plagiarism, the professors said that they were not aware of specific rules applying to the use of AI.Allison Copenbarger Vance, a deputy associate chancellor, said in an email that the students would not be punished. ""At the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, it is the discretion of faculty to clearly define the boundaries in their syllabi for using AI in student work,"" she said.

That made it disheartening that some students had used AI, Bagdi said.

UAE Global Win: Dubai crowned for having the best AI governance strategy in the world,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-global-win-dubai-crowned-for-having-the-best-ai-governance-strategyintheworld/articleshow/124939282.cms,"Dubai’s GDRFA wins global AI award for smarter services / Image: AI World Series Awards

Dubai’s winning moment on the global stage

Zero Compromise on Privacy: Your personal data and identity records are protected by the world's most rigorously controlled AI framework.



Faster Service: The underlying AI systems are governed for peak efficiency, meaning smoother, quicker interactions at airports and during residency transactions.



World-Class Trust: Dubai is now officially recognized as having the safest and most ethical digital ecosystem for identity and travel services.

How does GDRFA's AI strategy work and why won?

How will services likely change?

Faster e-gates and document-free lanes for eligible travellers, decreasing wait times.



More accurate identity checks reducing manual errors at counters and during visa processing.



Expanded online self-service so residents can complete renewals, status checks and appeals faster through secure portals.



Why does this matter beyond Dubai?





If you’ve ever wished government services were as fast and smooth as your favourite app, Dubai just turned that wish into reality. In a proud moment for the UAE, the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA) has been crowned for having the Best AI Governance Strategy in the world, setting a new benchmark for citizen-first digital services.The award celebrates GDRFA’s standout success in building a transparent, responsible, and citizen-centric AI ecosystem, particularly in immigration, residency services, and smart travel solutions. The win places Dubai ahead of several major international competitors, marking a milestone moment not only for the UAE but also for the wider Gulf region, as the government proves it can outperform global tech powerhouses in AI excellence.GDRFA was judged as the global gold standard for how the government should manage smart technology. For you, the beneficiary, this means:GDRFA’s winning edge comes from a clear and responsible approach to using artificial intelligence across Dubai’s residency and travel systems. Instead of adopting AI just for speed or automation, the department built a framework focused on accuracy, data protection, transparency, and human oversight, the key criteria that impressed the judges at the AI World Series Awards 2025.At the heart of the strategy is GDRFA’s investment in smart border control, biometric verification, predictive analysis for travel flows, and AI-assisted visa services, which together ensure faster processing with fewer errors. What sets Dubai apart is that every AI tool in its ecosystem is ethically governed, meaning decisions affecting residents, tourists or visa applicants are monitored and validated to remain fair, secure, and unbiased.This approach not only helped GDRFA raise service efficiency, but also positioned Dubai as a global benchmark for safe, reliable, and future-ready AI in government services, the exact reason it outperformed many global contenders.Expect a few user-facing shifts in coming months:These improvements are the direct payoff when governance-focused AI moves from lab to live systems: better user experience without trading off transparency or legal safeguards.Dubai’s win is a signal to businesses and travellers across the Gulf that public-sector AI can be both innovative and accountable. Strong governance attracts international investment, reassures visitors, and encourages other government bodies to adopt similar safeguards, a virtuous cycle that can boost tourism, speed cross-border travel, and improve regional interoperability of digital ID systems. In short: better governance = better public trust = more people comfortable using digital services.","The General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA) has been crowned for having the Best AI Governance Strategy in the world.

From grape to glass: how the Romans made wine

A glimpse into late Roman life





Archaeologists in Turkey have unearthed a remarkably preserved 1,600-year-old Roman wine production site beneath the ruins of an ancient mountain castle. The discovery, made near the village of Oymakli in southeastern Turkey’s Kahta district, sheds light on the scale and sophistication of winemaking in the late Roman period. The site includes grape-crushing installations, cisterns, and grinding stones, all remarkably intact after more than a millennium. Experts believe the complex once operated as a large-scale industrial winery, serving both local residents and the nearby Kahta Castle, an important stronghold during the Kingdom of Commagene.The excavation, led by the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism, began after archaeologists discovered fragments of stone and pottery believed to be of historical value. The site spans nearly 37 acres and lies in a mountainous region overlooking the Euphrates River valley.Researchers found several installations used to crush grapes and channel juice into cisterns for fermentation and storage. Grinding stones and remnants of clay vessels suggest the factory also produced flour and possibly olive oil, hinting at a wider agricultural economy.According to Mehmet Alkan, provincial museum director, the site’s foundations survived “remarkably well” despite being built from irregular stones.“Its preservation offers an exceptional look into ancient craftsmanship and industrial-scale production,” he said.The ancient wineworks lie close to Kahta Castle, a fortress originally built in the 2nd century BC for the Kingdom of Commagene, a Greco-Iranian dynasty that thrived before Roman annexation. Archaeologists believe the site may have once served both as a production hub and as a residential settlement for those who worked at or supplied the castle.Given the castle’s position on a major trade route between Mesopotamia and Anatolia, experts say the winery could have played a key role in provisioning the garrison and exporting wine across the region. The discovery provides rare evidence of how local economies functioned under Roman rule in Anatolia’s remote mountain regions.The structures uncovered mirror other Roman-era wineries found across the Mediterranean. Grapes were likely pressed manually or with wooden beams, allowing juice to flow through carved channels into stone basins. From there, it would have been stored in large clay jars, or amphorae, to ferment.Archaeologists also uncovered cisterns carved directly into rock, which would have stored water essential for both winemaking and daily life in this dry region. The presence of such facilities suggests that the complex operated at an industrial scale, far beyond the needs of a single household.Dating to the 4th century AD, the site falls within a period when Christianity was spreading through the Roman Empire and Constantinople was emerging as its new capital. The discovery shows that even in remote provinces, life thrived through trade, agriculture, and craftsmanship.The blend of Roman engineering and local traditions in the architecture highlights the cultural fusion that defined this era. “This settlement reflects both Roman influence and Anatolian adaptation,” researchers noted in their preliminary report.","Archaeologists in Turkey have unearthed a remarkably preserved 1,600-year-old Roman wine production site beneath the ruins of an ancient mountain castle. The site includes grape-crushing installations, cisterns, and grinding stones, all remarkably intact after more than a millennium. Experts believe the complex once operated as a large-scale industrial winery, serving both local residents and the nearby Kahta Castle.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124921027,imgsize-168658,width-400,resizemode-4/1600-year-old-roman-wine-factory-discovered-beneath-ancient-castle.jpg"

Saudi Arabia’s 'Stadium in the Sky' for 2034 FIFA World Cup: separating fact from fiction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabias-stadium-in-the-sky-for-2034-fifa-world-cup-separating-fact-from-fiction/articleshow/124930769.cms,"The Fact: A NEOM stadium is planned — but not in the sky





FIFA Shuts Down Trump's 2026 World Cup 'Unsafe Cities' Threat With Bold Remark

The Fiction: The viral “sky stadium” videos are AI-generated





Fact vs Fiction





The Bigger Picture





The Bottom Line









The internet can turn a concept sketch into a global sensation. In late October 2025, millions of people across X, TikTok, and YouTube watched a video showing what appeared to be a floating football stadium — a glowing bowl suspended 350 metres above the desert, nestled within Saudi Arabia’s futuristic city, NEOM: The Line. The captions were breathless: this was, they claimed, the NEOM Sky Stadium, a billion-dollar venue for the 2034 FIFA World Cup.It looked like the future of football. It wasn’t.Saudi Arabia’s official bid book for the 2034 FIFA World Cup lists 15 stadiums across Riyadh, Jeddah, Al Khobar, Abha, and NEOM. One of them, the NEOM Stadium, is described as being “more than 350 metres above ground level, within The Line.”That last phrase — “within The Line” — is what caused all the confusion.The stadium isn’t floating on a tower. It’s designed to be inside The Line’s vertical structure, part of a multi-level megacity that stacks entire neighbourhoods in layers. The stadium will occupy the fourth and fifth levels of this vast mirrored structure, making it high-altitude, but still fully enclosed.As ESPN reported, “the actual stadium proposed for construction in NEOM has been officially listed as one of the 15 host stadiums being either renovated or built from scratch for the FIFA 2034 World Cup for almost a year, and the Saudis do plan for it to be 350 metres above the ground.That is because they plan for it to form part of The Line, a proposed smart, green city in NEOM that will eventually extend in linear fashion for over 100 miles across the northwest Saudi province of Tabuk by 2045, powered entirely by renewable energy. ”Planned to seat around 46,000 spectators, the venue will be powered entirely by renewable energy and surrounded by a sports and wellness district, complete with hotels, apartments, and an electric transport network. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2027 and finish between 2032 and 2039, though The Line itself remains in its early stages of development.The viral clips of a glowing stadium hovering above the desert are not official footage. They were created by AI artists and CGI design accounts using programs such as Midjourney and Unreal Engine, taking NEOM’s futuristic imagery and exaggerating it for dramatic effect.Architectural analysts have pointed out the visual giveaways: lighting that doesn’t behave naturally, impossible reflections, and looping crowds that repeat in perfect synchrony. Even the drone-like camera sweeps in these videos defy real-world physics.NEOM’s official social media channels have not commented on these viral clips, and no government or FIFA outlet has ever released or endorsed them. The denials have instead come from journalists and design experts who confirmed that no such renders appear in the official World Cup bid or in NEOM’s verified materials.Several viral claims have blurred the line between fact and fantasy. The notion that Saudi Arabia is building a floating arena is false — official documents make clear the stadium is built within The Line’s vertical city, not on top of it. The circulating videos aren’t real construction footage; they’re AI-created visuals shared by fan-art accounts. Some users claimed Saudi officials had released these renders, but there’s no public statement or official post confirming or denying them. And despite online speculation, no construction has started; the project remains in its design phase, with The Line itself still under early development.Saudi Arabia’s 2034 World Cup forms part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030, a massive plan to transform the Kingdom into a global hub for sport, tourism, and technology. Projects such as The Line, Qiddiya, and New Murabba symbolise this futuristic ambition.Yet these megaprojects also face heavy criticism. Human-rights groups have documented forced evictions, executions of displaced tribespeople, and labour exploitation linked to NEOM’s construction. For many, the shimmering renderings of desert utopias mask a harsher reality on the ground.So while the AI-generated “stadium in the sky” dazzles online, the real story is more grounded — a mix of breathtaking ambition, architectural experimentation, and moral controversy.Saudi Arabia’s “Stadium in the Sky” exists only on screens. There is a NEOM Stadium planned for the 2034 World Cup — a high-altitude arena built within a vertical city, not floating above it. The viral clips showing a glowing bowl suspended over the desert are digital illusions, not construction updates. Like much of NEOM itself, the stadium represents a dream halfway between technology and theatre — where aspiration meets illusion, and the future of football is still being rendered.","Saudi Arabia’s official bid book for the 2034 FIFA World Cup lists 15 stadiums across Riyadh, Jeddah, Al Khobar, Abha, and NEOM.

Indian passport in UAE hits historic moment

What the three designs are and why it matters?

The older paper-based booklet (standard booklet issued before migration to machine-readable passports).

A machine-readable version with upgraded security features and newer cover design.

The latest e-passport series with an embedded chip and digital security, under the Passport Seva 2.0 rollout.

How it affects Indian expats in the UAE

What you should do now

Check which booklet series you hold and keep all pages in good condition (especially first and last pages).

When renewing, consider opting for the e-passport with a chip that offers longer validity, enhanced security, and easier travel clearance.

Retain copies (digital and paper) of your older passport if you are transitioning between designs, this helps avoid hiccups in sponsorship or residency records.

Stay tuned to official announcements from the Indian Embassy and Consulates in the UAE, changes to fees, booklet formats and services often come with some preparation time.





Indian expats in the UAE are witnessing a first-of-its-kind change, as the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi confirmed on October 28, 2025, that three different Indian passport designs are now officially in circulation the older booklet, the machine-readable version, and the newly introduced chip-enabled e-passport. The announcement marks a historic moment for the UAE’s Indian community, as the latest design under India’s Passport Seva 2.0 initiative brings enhanced security features, a smart embedded chip, and a refreshed visual layout, while older formats remain valid until expiry.Indian citizens residing in the UAE are now witnessing a unique first: three completely different Indian passport booklet designs in circulation at the same time. The development was reported by Gulf News, noting that expulsions of earlier classes and renewals mean holders could possess booklets of different series concurrently.Until recently, most Indian passport-holders abroad typically carried one design at a time: the older booklets, the newer machine-readable ones, or the latest biometric e-passports. But now, especially for the large Indian expatriate community in the UAE, all three are valid and in use.This arrangement creates both opportunity and confusion: renewal options, travel formalities, and verification processes may differ depending on which booklet a holder owns.The three designs currently in use include:For Indian expatriates in the UAE that means several practical implications: if you hold an older design passport you might face a different renewal fee, you may be required to convert to the new format sooner, and immigration authorities may ask for extra verification when travelling. Gulf News emphasised that all three booklets currently remain valid—but you must ensure your travel and visa arrangements recognise them.The Indian community in the UAE is among the world’s largest diaspora groups, making this passport transition especially significant. The rollout of the e-passport series coincides with the digitalisation of consular services at the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate in Dubai, which announced new online portals and chip-embedded passports effective from 28 October 2025.For UAE-based Indian expats, key take-aways include: ensuring your passport booklet is valid for at least six months before travel; if you hold an older series consider upgrading to the e-passport to access newer services; keep an eye on renewal fee changes; and confirm that your visa or employer sponsorship remains valid even if your booklet changes design.If you’re an Indian passport-holder in the UAE:This simultaneous circulation of three distinct passport designs may feel unusual, but it clearly reflects India’s ongoing move toward technological and service upgrades for its expanding global citizenry. For Indian expats in the UAE, it’s less about which specific booklet you hold and more about ensuring your travel, residency, and renewal documents remain valid and widely recognised. Secure your booklet, stay informed, and you’ll be fully ready for this exciting new phase of passport evolution.","Indian citizens residing in the UAE are witnessing a unique first: three completely different Indian passport booklet designs in circulation at the same time.

It's called the 'Dream of the Desert,' and trust me, this isn't your average train ride, it’s the Middle East's first five-star luxury train, and it’s going to redefine desert travel.“Dream of the Desert” is Saudi Arabia’s new ultra-luxury train project designed as a moving palace, part hotel, part restaurant, part cultural showcase. It’s being built by Italy’s Arsenale Group in partnership with Saudi Arabia Railways and several Saudi authorities as part of the kingdom’s push to expand high-end tourism under Vision 2030The ‘Dream of the Desert’ project was officially announced in Riyadh by Saudi Arabia Railways (SAR) in collaboration with Italy’s Arsenale Group, the company behind several luxury train and hospitality concepts worldwide. The announcement was made as part of Saudi Arabia’s ongoing push to elevate tourism and luxury travel offerings under the Vision 2030 strategy.Senior SAR officials, along with Arsenale’s leadership, revealed key details of the project, highlighting Saudi Arabia’s ambition to bring a world-class rail tourism experience to the region for the first time.

Why the upgrade matters









The Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate General of India in Dubai have announced the rollout of a new digital passport system for Indian citizens in the UAE. Starting from 28 October 2025, all applicants will receive chip-embedded e-passports under the upgraded Global Passport Seva Programme (GPSP 2.0) — a step designed to make passport services faster, safer and globally compliant.The GPSP 2.0 rollout is part of the Indian government’s effort to modernise passport services for citizens abroad. Starting 28 October 2025, all Indian passport applications in the UAE — including new passports, renewals, and other related services — must be submitted through the upgraded online portal:At the centre of this upgrade is the introduction of e-passports, each embedded with a secure microchip that stores digitised personal data of the passport holder. The embedded chip conforms to international biometric passport standards, designed to ensure smoother and faster immigration clearance across global checkpoints.This digital enhancement brings Indian passports in line with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)’s benchmarks for biometric and machine-readable travel documents. The same ICAO standards also now apply to passport photographs — a requirement that has been in force for Indian expats in the UAE since 1 September 2025.The Indian missions in the UAE have outlined a detailed process for applying under the new system:The upgraded system offers several user-friendly improvements intended to make the passport process faster and more efficient:For the large Indian expatriate community in the UAE — one of the biggest overseas Indian populations in the world — this transition to e-passports represents a major step forward in security, efficiency, and global mobility. The embedded-chip passports align India’s travel documents with international standards, improving authentication and reducing risks of tampering or duplication.By digitising more critical stages of the application process, GPSP 2.0 not only significantly reduces tedious paperwork and waiting time but also ensures a safer, more secure, and transparent experience for applicants. For Indian missions in the UAE, it further streamlines backend operations and ensures far greater data consistency across interconnected systems.As the new system officially takes effect from 28 October 2025, both the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate General of India in Dubai have strongly urged all applicants to familiarise themselves early with the updated procedures and to transition smoothly to the enhanced GPSP 2.0 digital platform.","The Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate General of India in Dubai have announced the rollout of a new digital passport system for Indian citizens in the UAE.

Why UK government launched this plan



What is the use of ID?



How Veteran can use access digital IDs?



Is it similar to India?







The UK government launched the digital version of its ID scheme on Friday, intended for former members of the armed services.This ID will mean passports, driving licenses, national insurance cards, and many more being virtual, instead of—or as well as—being stored in a shoebox or under socks in a drawer, Sky News reported.The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.The govt claims the initiative is designed to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for those without status to secure employment.Ministers contend that the ability to obtain jobs is a primary attraction for migrants entering the UK unlawfully. Under the new system, employers will no longer be able to depend on National Insurance numbers—which currently serve as part of proof of the right to work—or on paper-based verification methods, BBC reported.""At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy—people sharing National Insurance numbers for example. The idea is that having a picture attached would make it—in theory—harder to abuse that system,"" a government spokesperson explained.The digital IDs, which will be app-based and stored on smartphones akin to the NHS App or digital bank cards, will contain information such as the holder's residency status, name, date of birth, nationality, and a photograph.Sir Keir, when announcing the scheme, stated: ""You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that.""From today, Friday 17 October, it will give ex-soldiers a seamless way to confirm their status in person and will include information already featured on their physical card with the security features that protect their personal information.Ministers hope the digital veteran card will show how the technology works and quash public concerns about privacy and security.Veterans will now be able to hold their credentials in a smartphone app called Gov.uk One Login. The govt had previously announced that digital credentials, including the veteran card, would be stored in an app named Gov.uk Wallet. It now states it will “transition to talking about [One Login] as the Gov.uk Wallet” as more govt-issued credentials become available digitally. The credential will be stored under encryption in the app, similar to how a train or concert ticket is held in an Apple or Google wallet, The Guardian reported.Verification using face ID or a fingerprint will be required to access it, and the govt claims it is safer than physical IDs. Another version of the credential will be held by the Ministry of Defence, and as more IDs are added, the information will remain with each issuer and in the citizens’ app, ensuring there is no central database of all ID data, thereby avoiding what some have feared could be a “honeypot for hackers”.India has well established digital ID system. India’s digital ID system, Aadhaar, is significantly larger and more detailed than the UK’s planned system.New Delhi stores citizens’ fingerprints, eye scans, photos, home addresses and phone numbers, with the system processing approximately 80 million authentications daily.Under Aadhaar, every Indian citizen receives a 12-digit number intended to replace numerous paper documents. All adults and children over the age of five must provide biometric information. The system verifies identities for activities such as opening bank accounts or applying for new SIM cards. It also aimed to streamline the disbursement of govt benefits, providing holders with instant proof of identity and access to basic services.Aadhaar and UK's digital ID seems to be same.India also have other apps like DigiLocker, where you can store all the important documents like Aadhar Card, Pan card, driving license digitally at one place, Digi Yatra and many more.The UK's digital ID seems to be following the similar model of India. Like DigiLocker, UK is introducing Gov.UK Wallet. Few days ago, UK PM Keir Starmer made his first trip to India and hailed India’s ID system as a “massive success”.During his trade-centric visit to Mumbai, Starmer also met with Nandan Nilekani, co-founder and chair of Indian tech services group Infosys, who led the govt body responsible for delivering the ID database more than a decade ago.",The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country. The govt claims the initiative is designed to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for those without status to secure employment. The digital IDs will be app-based and stored on smartphones akin to the NHS App or digital bank cards.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124632061,imgsize-139073,width-400,resizemode-4/veteran39s-digital-trust.jpg"
Monkey madness in Mississippi: Lab monkeys escape from truck after highway crash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/monkey-madness-in-mississippi-lab-monkeys-escape-from-truck-after-highway-crash/articleshow/124903577.cms,"Representative AI image

Panic In Mississippi As Herpes-Infected Monkey Escapes Crash Scene And Evades Massive Police Hunt

Law enforcement vs. banana bandits







It was meant to be just another shipment, a truck rumbling down Interstate 59 with lab monkeys headed to a future full of medical tests, needles and white coats. But fate had other ideas. A sudden crash flipped the truck on its side, doors flew open, and the once-caged primates suddenly found themselves staring at the greatest opportunity of their furry lives. What began as a tragic highway accident became, for a handful of escape artists, a jailbreak dream come true. While officers panicked and residents locked their doors, the monkeys saw only one thing: freedom, as reported by the Mississippi Free Press.Residents who passed by the overturned truck witnessed scenes normally reserved for comedy films or escape-the-zoo memes. Monkeys leapt from the trailer, darting toward the woods with the kind of excitement that only comes from illegally skipping medical research duty. Officials urged everyone to stay far away, while the monkeys clearly preferred to play far away.Soon the highway became a primate-tracking battleground.Sheriff’s deputies, wildlife officers and highway patrol agents fanned out, radios crackling as they attempted to locate “five missing monkeys”. The fugitives were small, speedy and absolutely uninterested in human authority. Meanwhile, memes were already being drafted.Rumours spread that the monkeys were infectious with all sorts of terrifying diseases. Tulane University quickly stepped in to say: absolutely not. No viruses. No zombie outbreak. No Planet of the Apes Part One. Just regular lab monkeys who got a little too curious about roadside adventure.While the monkeys imagined a new start in the Mississippi wilderness, reality eventually caught up. Professional animal handlers arrived, armed not with fear but with food. The dramatic standoff ended, free-range monkey life lasted only hours, and the fugitives returned to captivity with incredible stories to tell their cage-mates.In the end, no humans were harmed and no contagious chaos broke out. But locals may be checking the trees for weeks, just in case another tiny escape artist decides to test their luck.","A truck carrying lab monkeys was overturned on Interstate 59 in Mississippi.

Why Zohran Mamdani's aunt is a topic of discussion



Mamdani Under FIRE After Resurfaced NYPD–IDF Conspiracy Video Shocks Voters | WATCH





After New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani clarified that the 9/11 anecdote was not about his Masuma Mamdani , his father's sister, but someone called Zehra Fui who was his father's cousin and is not alive any more, a new debate started on social media delving into who all brown people address as aunts. ""Your 'father's cousin' is not your aunt,"" New York Post's Miranda Devine wrote, only to receive a strong pushback from many Asian-origin commentators that a father's cousin is indeed an aunt.In a recent speech where Mamdani spoke about Islamophobia, Mamdani said his aunt felt unsafe in her hijab in the US after 9/11. The comment became a laughing stock for MAGA as they derided how Mamdani made 9/11 about his family, projecting his aunt as the real victim of 9/11.MAGA supporters delved deep and then found out that Mamdani's aunt Masuma Mamdani did not even live in the US during 9/11 and does not wear hijab in any of the publicly available photos. Mamdani was called a liar for cooking up a false story about his aunt.""I was speaking about my aunt, Zehra Fuhi, my father's cousin who sadly passed away a few years ago, and for the takeaway from my more-than-10-minute address about Islamophobia in this city to be the question of my aunt tells you everything about Andrew Cuomo and his inability to recon his crisis,"" Mamdani clarified.A major social media debate erupted over whether a father's cousin can be called an aunt, with Mehdi Hasan pitching in and speaking for all the brown people that a parent's cousin is indeed an aunt. Sana Ebrahimi, a social media user who first called out Mamdani for lying about his aunt, slammed Mehdi Hasn and claimed that Iranians do not call their parents cousins, uncles or aunts -- there are separate terms, but that claim too came under attack.","New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani made a 9/11 anecdote about his aunt.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Super senior citizens (80 and above) can submit theirs starting from October 1, with the same deadline.If the life certificate is not submitted by the deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting the following month.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online via the Jeevan Pramaan portal, through doorstep banking agents, using biometric devices at post offices, or in person at bank branches.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online by using the Jeevan Pramaan portal and completing biometric verification through designated apps.Yes, pensioners can submit their life certificates in person at their respective banks or post offices.Generally, you will need your Aadhaar number for biometric verification, along with any other identification or pension-related documents as required by your pension disbursing authority.Pensioners can check the status of their life certificate submission through the Jeevan Pramaan portal or by contacting their bank or pension disbursing authority.Yes, if your submission fails, you can reapply and submit your life certificate again using the same methods available to you.",Submission window for 'Jeevan Pramaan Patra' opens for pensioners under 80 with a deadline of November 30. Pensioners can opt to have a bank agent visit them at home to facilitate the submission of their life certificate. This method is particularly beneficial for those with mobility issues.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114942014,imgsize-53514,width-400,resizemode-4/114942014.jpg"
"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky has warned companies against replacing entry-level workers with artificial intelligence (AI), arguing that failing to hire young employees today will create a leadership crisis tomorrow.""[AI] can do a lot of lower-level, more entry-level position jobs. But if no young people can get jobs, then you have no one in the future to do the highly strategic leadership positions,"" Chesky told ABC News in a recent interview (via Fortune).“So we need to make room for people early in their careers, even if AI can do the interns' work,” he added.Chesky’s comments come as companies including Amazon, Meta, and Salesforce cut workers to make way for AI investments and job automation, raising fears that technology could permanently replace human jobs, the report said, adding that employers are using AI to automate simpler, lower-level tasks, managers express hesitance to hire Gen Z professionals, and internship opportunities are dwindling.Despite AI's capabilities, Chesky maintained that humans don't “realize how smart people are relative to AI,” and that workers will always be needed for novel and operational tasks.More importantly, he argued, chatbots lack the human touch necessary for effective leadership.“People are going to still want relationships. Leadership is still going to matter. I think AI is mostly going to be a tool. I don't think it's magic,” Chesky noted.However, for Gen Z to develop these leadership capabilities, they need opportunities to work their way from the bottom up and learn the ropes—especially as millennials and Gen Xers eventually age out of their positions.","Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky warned companies against replacing entry-level workers with artificial intelligence.

Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses





Meta has reportedly urged the US district court to dismiss a copyright lawsuit from adult-film producer Strike 3 Holdings, which accused the tech giant of illegally torrenting thousands of its videos to train an unannounced AI model. In a court filing, Meta described the allegations as resting on “guesswork and innuendo” and labeled Strike 3 a “‘copyright troll’ that files extortive lawsuits.” “These claims are bogus,” a Meta spokesperson told Ars Technica. Strike 3 had traced roughly 2,400 downloads of its titles to Meta corporate IP addresses over seven years, plus additional activity it alleged Meta hid behind a “stealth network” of 2,500 obscured addresses. The plaintiff speculated the files fed a secret adult version of Movie Gen, Meta’s video-generation AI, and sought damages potentially topping $350 million.Meta countered that the downloads began in 2018 -- four years before its multimodal and generative-video research—and totaled just 22 titles annually, “intermittently obtained one file at a time.” Such “meager, uncoordinated activity,” the company wrote, points to “private personal use” by individuals, not a coordinated data-harvesting effort.“[T]hefar more plausible inference… is that disparate individuals downloaded adult videos for personal use,” Meta’s motion states.The company noted that its terms of service prohibit generating adult content, “contradicting the premise that such materials might even be useful for Meta’s AI training.” Strike 3, Meta added, “cite[d] no facts to suggest that Meta has ever trained an AI model on adult images or video, much less intentionally so.”Meta also disputed any firm link to its employees. “Tens of thousands of employees,” plus contractors, visitors, and third parties, access its network daily, the filing says. One cited incident involved a contractor allegedly torrenting at his father’s house; Meta called this “plainly indicative of personal consumption” and noted the engineer’s automation role offered “no apparent basis” for sourcing training data. On the “stealth network” claim, Meta asked: “[W]hy would Meta seek to ‘conceal’ certain alleged downloads… but use easily traceable Meta corporate IP addresses for many hundreds of others?”Meta noted that Strike 3 cannot claim that Meta should have been better at “policing” its network for illegal activity. “Monitoring every file downloaded by any person using Meta’s global network would be an extraordinarily complex and invasive undertaking,” Meta argued, citing precedent that only requires Meta employ a “simple measure” to monitor such activity.Meta further argued it cannot be expected to minutely police every download across its global network, citing legal precedent requiring only “simple measure[s]” to curb infringement. “We don’t want this type of content, and we take deliberate steps to avoid training on this kind of material,” the Meta spokesperson told Ars Technica.Strike 3 has two weeks to respond, per TorrentFreak. A victory for Meta means that it not only avaoids hefty damages but reinforce its stand that its video AI tools are designed to stay away from explicit material.","Adult-film producer accused Meta of illegally torrenting thousands of its videos to train an unannounced AI model.

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix.

A robotics company is now accepting pre-orders for Neo, a humanoid robot designed to handle household tasks—but there's a catch. The $20,000 machine won't actually be working alone. Instead, a human operator will remotely control it through cameras while peering into your home.1X Technologies showed off its robot, named Neo, as a 5-foot-6-inch, 66-pound assistant capable of folding laundry, loading dishwashers, and fetching groceries. The robot is built with a patented tendon-driven actuator system that its makers say allows gentle, quiet movement—they go on to promise it to be quieter than a refrigerator. The Neo has a soft polymer body and 3D lattice structure that help it move smoothly around humans, without posing a safety hazard. Neo can lift up to 154 pounds and carry 55 pounds, with IP68-rated waterproof hands for wet tasks. The robot can run for four hours on a single charge. It also supports WiFi, Bluetooth, and 5G—just pop in a SIM card for cellular access.But here's where things get interesting. While Neo can handle basic autonomous tasks like opening doors or turning off lights, anything more complex requires human intervention—literally.CEO Bernt Børnich told The Wall Street Journal that Neo's AI system still needs real-world training data to improve. That means early adopters must agree to let human teleoperators see inside their homes through the robot's cameras to teach it new tasks.""If we don't have your data, we can't make the product better,"" Børnich explained. Owners can schedule when operators take control through an app, specify tasks, and designate no-go zones. The company also promises to blur humans from the operator's view and has implemented security measures to prevent unauthorized access.The company's bet is that enough people will trade privacy concerns for convenience—and contribute to training an AI that might eventually work independently. Whether households are ready to invite remotely operated robots into their daily routines remains to be seen.The company promises deliveries will begin in 2026, with a $499 monthly subscription option also available. Early buyers need only put down a $200 deposit to secure their spot. Neo comes in tan, gray, and dark brown.","Neo is a 5-foot-6-inch, 66-pound robot designed to handle household tasks.
