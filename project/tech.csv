Ten-year-old Renad Attallah has become an unexpected beacon of hope through her cooking tutorials on Instagram, shared from the heart of the Gaza Strip . Despite the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, Renad’s cheerful videos showcase creative ways to prepare meals using the limited ingredients available in a conflict-ridden region. “We stay up without caffeine; coffee is just a bonus,” she says while demonstrating her version of iced coffee.Renad’s tutorials cover a range of dishes, including a burger made with luncheon meat from aid packages, caramelised sugar lollipops, and a honey cake improvised with powdered milk.Cooking, for her, is a source of comfort. “Whenever I’m sad, I try to make a chocolate mug cake,” she says, using her kitchen as a refuge from the harsh realities of life in Gaza.Living in a shelter with her mother and sisters, Renad has continued to post videos from their temporary home, often seen unboxing aid packages or whipping up a "" War Sandwich "" using sparse ingredients. In one tutorial, she prepares fish tenders, explaining, “Normally we use fillet fish, but it hasn’t been available for 11 months. I got hold of some un-fresh fish which became available only in the last two months. But for me, I prefer fish more than chicken—what about you?”Her recipes and captions not only highlight the food but also the emotional weight of life in a conflict zone. In one post, Renad reflects on a vermicelli dish that reminds her of peaceful Friday breakfasts before the war. “Now, there are no studies, no work, and no Friday celebrations—only the vermicelli and the tiredness remain.”Renad has garnered a global following, using her platform to encourage donations for feeding families in Gaza.

Exploding Pagers: How Israel’s Mossad convinced Hezbollah to buy its exploding pagers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/how-israels-mossad-convinced-hezbollah-to-buy-its-exploding-pagers/articleshow/113980318.cms,"In a covert operation by Israel's Mossad , Hezbollah was convinced to purchase and distribute pagers to thousands of its operatives. The scheme was designed to infiltrate the group's communication system, ultimately leading to the deaths and injuries of many members.The story began two years ago when Mossad devised a plan to use pagers as a Trojan horse to penetrate Hezbollah's network.The device in question, the AR924 pager , appeared to be an ideal tool for a militia group like Hezbollah. It was rugged, waterproof, and came with an oversized battery capable of lasting months without needing a recharge. The pagers were marketed as being immune to Israeli tracking, which appealed greatly to Hezbollah’s leaders, who were always wary of Israeli intelligence monitoring their communications.Follow: Live updates on Israel Hezbollah war In early 2023, Hezbollah made a bulk purchase of these pagers, convinced of their reliability. The devices were distributed to mid-level fighters and support personnel across Lebanon and Syria . What Hezbollah didn’t realise was that Mossad had designed the pagers themselves. Hidden within the battery pack of each device was a powerful explosive, which could be triggered remotely by Mossad or activated through a two-step process. The latter option involved pressing two buttons to decrypt messages, meaning the user would likely be holding the device with both hands when it detonated.On September 17, thousands of these pagers exploded simultaneously, killing or maiming an estimated 3,000 Hezbollah officers, fighters, and civilians. The operation is considered one of the most audacious and effective pieces of spycraft in recent history.Read more: How Israel's Mossad turned everyday pagers into deadly weapons against Hezbollah The plan originated in 2022 when Mossad, tasked with combating foreign threats to Israel, sought new ways to infiltrate Hezbollah, which had grown increasingly sophisticated in its communications.The organisation was desperate to avoid Israeli surveillance, and Mossad capitalised on this paranoia by offering Hezbollah what seemed to be secure, untraceable communication devices.To ensure the plan’s success, Mossad had to conceal the origins of the pagers. The devices were branded as Taiwanese and sold through a marketing official who had no knowledge of the true intent behind the sales. Hezbollah had been successfully misled into buying and distributing what were essentially bombs designed by their enemy.The first part of Mossad's pager plot was triggered on September 17. Explosions occurred simultaneously across Lebanon and Syria as Hezbollah operatives attempted to access encrypted messages. The two-step decryption process, which required both hands, ensured maximum casualties as fighters were directly exposed to the blasts. A day later, Mossad remotely triggered walkie-talkies that had been similarly booby-trapped, further adding to the chaos.This operation resulted in devastating consequences for Hezbollah, severely damaging its leadership and disrupting its communication networks. Israel followed up with airstrikes on Hezbollah’s key military infrastructure, intensifying the group's vulnerability. Despite the success of this operation, it also led to heightened tensions in the region, with Hezbollah and its backers, including Iran, retaliating and threatening further escalation.The attack is seen as a turning point in Israel’s ongoing conflict with Hezbollah, demonstrating the lengths Mossad is willing to go to neutralise threats and highlighting the profound risks of modern spycraft.","Israel's Mossad devised a plan to use pagers as a Trojan horse to penetrate Hezbollah's network.

The pink is due to a genetic mutation.""With infectious enthusiasm, Jamie explains the rarity of this encounter, noting that only 1% of people may have the chance to witness such a phenomenon in their lifetime.She goes on to reveal the scientific reason behind the grasshopper's unique coloration, attributing it to a genetic mutation that causes an overproduction of pink pigment and an underproduction of black.''Wow, I just found a pink grasshopper. There's like 1% of people can see pink grasshoppers in their lifetime. So, I am so lucky to be able to see it.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Nintendo surprised fans today by announcing not Switch 2 , but a $100 alarm clock, named Alarmo that brings Nintendo game sounds to your morning routine.Alarmo isn't just any alarm clock. It can sense your movements, letting you snooze or turn off the alarm without pushing buttons. The clock plays music and sounds from five Nintendo games like Super Mario Odyssey , Splatoon 3, Legend of Zelda : Breath of the Wild, Pinkmin 4, and RingFit Adventure to wake you up.You can choose between two main alarm types. ""Steady Mode"" gets louder if you don't wake up quickly. ""Gentle Mode"" keeps the same volume for a calmer wake-up. Alarmo plays sound effects as you wake up, sort of cheering you up to get up from bed, and the moment you are up, the alarm will stop automatically.There are a total of 35 different wake-up scenes, seven from each game -- that combines the music and sound. It will get even more sounds later on, adding music from Mario Kart and Animal Crossing games.Alarmo does more than just wake you up. It can play soft game music to help you fall asleep. It also tracks how much you move while sleeping, showing this information in its Records section.Some fans were hoping for news about a new game console. Instead, they got this playful alarm clock. It's an unusual move for Nintendo, but lately Nintendo is trying things beyond just making video games and consoles. Last month, they opened aNintendo museum in Kyoto, Japan. Now, with Alarmo, they're bringing their games into people's daily lives in a new way, which could make waking up a little less miserable.Nintendo Switch Online members in the US and Canada can buy Alarmo now, before anyone else. Other people will have to wait until next year to get one (and also for the Switch 2).","Alarm clock plays music and sounds from five Nintendo games to wake you up.

How this outage affected users



Thousands of TSB customers across the UK have been facing disruptions as the bank's mobile app and online banking services experienced widespread outages. Reports of login failures and difficulties accessing accounts began flooding as the banks’ online services left many customers unable to manage their finances. According to a report by The Standard, customers have complained that during the outage they were unable to make payments, check balances and manage their daily banking needs.In a post on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), TSB has assured customers that their money remains safe and that it is working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.TSB Bank , which serves over five million customers and operates more than 220 branches across the UK, has acknowledged the issue and is working to restore services. This latest disruption adds to a series of recent technical challenges faced by the bank, raising concerns about the reliability of its digital platforms.According to Down Detector UK, more than 2,000 issues were reported at one point earlier today. However, the reports have gone down with time.TSB customers have taken to social media to reveal how they were affected during the recent outage. As per their reports, the outage left them unable to access their accounts and make payments. Some users even mentioned that the timing of the outage was poor as they urgently needed to manage their finances.“The @TSB app is down or being updated more times than it is working,” wrote one user.Another added: “Well done @TSB on my payday of all days when I need to pay all my bills I can’t. Because you’ve decided to mess about with the app and I can’t approve payments. Cheers.”In some cases, the app suggested that users don’t have accounts at all. Others also highlighted that they’ve struggled to connect with customer services to resolve the issue.A third user noted: “It’s one thing to have technical issues, but if it’s followed up by no available customer service or a public statement/update… well, that really shows your true colours as a company I guess.”",Thousands of TSB customers across the UK have been facing disruptions as the bank's mobile app and online banking services experienced widespread outages.

Take a look at Tejasvi Surya’s post

“Hello Deepinder, in Bengaluru South, we've taken few key measures to better the working conditions of delivery executives.

When we set up a resting point for delivery partners at the Vega City Mall in June 2023, we ensured that they have convenient access to the mall & are able to enjoy a break during the wait for the order.

With essential amenities such as first-aid, drinking water, and clean restrooms, the point provides a place for all delivery partners to rest, rejuvenate, and recharge. We were the first to do this in Bengaluru South, understanding the daily struggles that delivery partners go through.

Also happy to inform that under the MPLADS, we set up the first resting point for wheelchair delivery partners outside the MP office in Jayanagar. Here, we welcome delivery partners and provide them drinking water, restrooms & mobile charging points.

We will further work on building such spaces for the benefit of gig workers in Bengaluru South, making it a model for the rest of the country.”
