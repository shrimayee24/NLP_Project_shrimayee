Sydney Sweeney humiliated online as Swifties insist she’d be forbidden from Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s wedding guest list,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/sydney-sweeney-humiliated-online-as-swifties-insist-shed-be-forbidden-from-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelces-wedding-guest-list/articleshow/125146773.cms,"A viral clip of Sydney Sweeney and Scooter Braun kissing in Central Park has sparked widespread disbelief and accusations of a staged romance online. Fans are comparing the perceived lack of chemistry and performative nature of their relationship to the genuine public reception of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's romance, casting doubt on the couple's authenticity.

Fans accuse the romance of being staged and drag Taylor Swift into the discourse

More coverage on NFL:

Hollywood is rarely short of a headline-grabbing romance, but the Sydney Sweeney–Scooter Braun storyline has hit a different level of disbelief on social media. A new viral clip showing the pair kissing on a rock in New York’s Central Park sent the internet into defense mode and in 2025, few celebrity narratives spark skepticism faster than anything involving Braun.The rumored couple has reportedly been moving quickly since September, but fans are questioning everything from their chemistry to the timing. Many are convinced the relationship is built for cameras, not connection. And yes, because everything in pop culture eventually loops back to it, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s names have now been dragged into the conversation too.As the video circulated, the tone of the comments wasn’t playful, it was almost unanimously uncomfortable. One user wrote, “This looks so staged.. it’s awkward.” Another added, “Omg so performative.”And the one-liner that instantly went viral, “Definitely not on Taylor Swift's wedding list.” That single sentence reminded everyone that Braun still sits in the same pop-culture shadow that started when he purchased Swift’s masters. The moment fans referenced Taylor Swift, the relationship became more than just a maybe-celebrity fling, it became part of a larger cultural villain narrative.Braun has been photographed with Sweeney at events, reported yacht days, and private parties. Sources insist the romance has been “full throttle” since late September. But the internet isn’t buying the dream. They’re treating it like a PR sequence, especially with the timing aligning with her rising Hollywood earnings and his ongoing public image cleanup.Meanwhile, Swift, enjoying the softer, happier cultural reception of her real-life romance with Travis Kelce, remains the unspoken standard fans compare any Braun-centric storyline against. And in that comparison? The internet’s verdict is cold, sharp, and clear, if this new couple wants to be taken seriously, they’ll need more than park PDA.At this point, the backlash isn’t about a kiss, it’s about credibility. Until they show genuine connection beyond staged optics, the internet isn’t offering either of them the benefit of the doubt.",A viral clip of Sydney Sweeney and Scooter Braun kissing in Central Park has sparked widespread disbelief and accusations of a staged romance.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification







Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Banality of evil: German nurse kills 10 patients,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/banality-of-evil-german-nurse-kills-10-patients-to-reduce-workload/articleshow/125132828.cms,"



It sounds like a line from a Kafka play rewritten by Kafka’s nurse. A man whose job was to ease suffering decided the easiest way to do that was to remove the sufferer entirely.According to a BBC report, a palliative care nurse in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering 10 patients and attempting to kill 27 others. His motive? Not money. Not mercy. Just the mundane — to lighten his workload during overnight shifts.Between December 2023 and May 2024, this nameless nurse — anonymous by law, infamous by act — played God with a syringe. Prosecutors said he injected elderly patients with morphine and midazolam, not to relieve their pain but to make his rounds quieter, his night easier, his burden lighter. He showed, the court heard, “irritation” at those who demanded too much care — as if suffering were an inconvenience on the shift roster.The court in Aachen called it a crime of “particular severity of guilt,” ensuring he will never walk free again. But what’s truly chilling is not just the scale of his actions — it’s their ordinariness. A man trained since 2007 to heal became, by 2024, an executioner in scrubs, armed not with malice but with indifference.Investigators are now exhuming more bodies, probing whether this was just the visible tip of a career-long pattern.If confirmed, he could rival the grim legacy of Niels Högel — the German nurse sentenced in 2019 for killing 85 patients in northern hospitals between 1999 and 2005. Högel wanted to play hero: inject, cause cardiac arrest, then resuscitate — a perverse performance of saviourhood.This new killer? He wanted peace and quiet.That’s the most terrifying part. Evil, it turns out, doesn’t always come snarling. Sometimes it sighs, glances at the clock, and reaches for the morphine. It isn’t ideological or even sadistic — just tired, overworked, and catastrophically devoid of empathy.In that sense, this case isn’t only about a man who murdered ten people. It’s about the slow erosion of compassion in systems that reduce care to shift patterns and metrics. When life becomes data, death becomes a shortcut.Germany has seen this before. It will see it again. Because as Hannah Arendt might have said of this nurse, it wasn’t the devil in him that killed those patients — it was the paperwork.","A palliative care nurse in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering 10 patients and attempting to kill 27 others.

Password for Louvre’s security system was ‘LOUVRE’ — and social media can’t stop laughing: ‘Not even L0uvr3?!’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/password-for-louvres-security-system-was-louvre-and-social-media-cant-stop-laughing-not-even-l0uvr3/articleshow/125117435.cms,"Watch: Louvre Jewels Stolen In Seconds: Thief Caught On Camera

Social media reactions:





A post-heist security audit has revealed shocking details about the Louvre’s cybersecurity, revealing that the password protecting France’s most famous museum’s video surveillance system was simply “LOUVRE. ”French newspaper Libération first reported the revelation.The revelations come weeks after the daring October 18 heist, in which thieves made off with crown jewels worth $102 million (£76 million) from the Galerie d’Apollon in broad daylight in a few minutes. The robbers entered via a balcony using a stolen mechanical lift, smashed display cases, and escaped.The findings about the security system are part of a wider trove of documents from the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI), which has been auditing the museum’s systems for more than a decade.In a 2014 review, ANSSI warned that the Louvre’s IT systems that are responsible for alarms, access control, and video surveillance were dangerously vulnerable. “An attacker who manages to take control of it would be able to facilitate damage or even theft of artworks,” the report said.Cybersecurity advisor Javvad Malik of software firm KnowBe4 described the museum’s defences as “shockingly simplistic.” He told the Daily Mail, “The museum's video surveillance systems were protected by shockingly simplistic passwords.Whether this weakness played a role in the heist is still under review. But the lesson is clear. When systems safeguarding priceless cultural treasures rely on guessable credentials, it's not a policy gap – it is an invitation, serving as an indicator that the overall culture of security may be weak. ”Adding to the embarrassment, the report found the museum was still using outdated versions of Windows, which experts say is equivalent to “leaving your front door unlocked.” Later reviews, including those as recent as 2025, suggested the Louvre continued to suffer from major cybersecurity flaws.Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau told Franceinfo radio that the suspects were likely “petty criminals rather than professional members of an organised crime group.”The French daylight heist has since resulted in the endless ridicule of the Louvre across social media, including from billionaire CEO Elon Musk.","Post-heist security audit reveals shocking details about the Louvre's cybersecurity.

"UAE debuts VR reconstruction of Makkah and Madina from the Prophet’s era, rendered in amazing detail",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-debuts-vr-reconstruction-of-makkah-and-madina-from-the-prophets-era-rendered-in-amazing-detail/articleshow/125124834.cms,"At Sharjah Book Fair, visitors wearing VR headsets explore ancient Makkah streets and the Holy Kaaba/Representative Image

Reconstructing the streets of ancient Makkah





Witnessing the birth of a community





Madina and the principles of early islam





An educational and emotional experience









Visitors to the Sharjah International Book Fair are now able to experience the heart of early Islam as never before. A new virtual reality (VR) installation, developed by Ana Al Madina, transports participants more than 1,400 years back in time, offering an immersive encounter with the streets, homes, and spiritual landmarks of Makkah and Madina. The experience blends meticulous historical reconstruction with advanced VR technology, allowing users to witness the life, culture, and transformative events of the Prophet Muhammad’s era in vivid, almost tangible detail.The VR journey begins in the very heart of pre-Islamic Makkah, the city of the Prophet’s birth. Participants descend through space before landing in a bustling metropolis, where narrow alleys and open markets unfold around them. Rough stones form the Kaaba, surrounded by the idols that once stood there. Traders sell goods, residents move through crowded streets, and the narration provides insight into daily life, including social norms and the position of women and young girls prior to Islam.The simulation then leads viewers through the early life of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Key moments include his spiritual retreat in the Cave of Hira, where Angel Jibreel revealed the first message of Islam.The visual and auditory elements are designed to create an overwhelming sense of presence, with visitors often instinctively reaching toward the cave walls as if to confirm the reality of the experience.Dr Adil Abdul Qadir, Manager of Ana Al Madina, explained the intent behind the project: “This VR set is designed purely for educational purposes. People who experience it understand what Makkah and Madina were like 1,400 years ago—the culture, the lifestyle, and the way people interacted.”The simulation continues by showing the early Muslim armies forming in Makkah, followed by the city’s transformation after the spread of Islam. These sequences provide both historical context and emotional resonance, culminating in the transition to the modern-day Kaaba. At this stage, users can virtually step inside the Holy Kaaba itself, observing its structure, golden lamps, and the serenity that defines the sacred space. For many, the experience is profoundly moving.“The feeling of watching or experiencing this is amazing,” Dr Adil said. “Many people come out with tears in their eyes because it feels so real, as if they have truly travelled back in time. It helps them understand the message of peace and unity that the Prophet brought.”The VR journey then transports participants to Madina, highlighting the Prophet’s migration and the construction of Masjid Al Nabawi. Users catch glimpses of his home, community life, and the societal structures he established. The simulation emphasises the core values of early Islamic society: compassion, equality, and justice. Every visual and narrative element is designed to reinforce how these principles shaped both the community and the broader trajectory of Islam.Dr Adil summarised the broader purpose of the project: “This remarkable journey connects people to faith through deep knowledge. We want visitors not just to see history, but to truly feel it, to experience the timeless values that shaped our world.”The Ana Al Madina VR experience represents more than a technological marvel; it is an educational tool and a spiritual bridge. By combining historical accuracy with immersive storytelling, it allows users to engage with the earliest days of Islam in a way that is both intellectually enlightening and emotionally resonant. Visitors leave with a deeper understanding of Makkah and Madina’s heritage, the life of the Prophet, and the enduring values he imparted.","Ana Al Madina has created a virtual reality installation at Sharjah International Book Fair.

The announcement and immediate action

Your responsibility

The takeaway





The days of waking up and frantically checking local news for a last-minute school cancellation are officially over. The Saudi Ministry of Education has issued a formal and highly detailed ministerial order for the 1447 academic year, establishing clear, scientific benchmarks for when in-person studies must be suspended. This decisive policy removes all guesswork, ensuring that the health and safety of every student and teacher are prioritized the moment weather conditions become dangerous. Crucially, the order confirms that suspension (تعليق الدراسة) does not mean a holiday; it means an immediate, seamless pivot to remote learning, guaranteeing the educational process remains continuous.The Ministry of Education (and regional education directorates) set clear, limited situations when in-person schooling may be suspended. These decisions are not ad-hoc: they follow coordination with the National Meteorological Authority (or regional weather services) and Civil Defence, and they focus on actual risks to students’ and staff’s safety for example heavy rain/flooding, severe sandstorms, major infectious outbreaks, or national events that disrupt normal travel. Announcements are only official when released by the Ministry or the local education office.In a significant upgrade from previous policies, the Ministry now relies on specific, quantifiable metrics before authorizing a change in attendance. Regional education departments are expected to coordinate with weather services, automatically triggering a switch to remote learning when any of these nine conditions are met:While the new policy addresses unexpected weather disruptions, the Ministry has also confirmed the foundational academic schedule for the current year. Students should keep these dates locked in as they prepare for the first semester's official examinations:The seamless shift to remote learning, enabled by this new ministerial order, means that even severe weather events will not compromise the integrity or timing of these critical academic milestones.The notification process is designed to be fast and authoritative: The official announcement will come directly from the regional directorates of the Ministry of Education, often in coordination with the local Civil Defense authorities who monitor the weather. News is typically shared via official social media channels (like X/Twitter) and through local news outlets. Parents and students should also rely on official announcements from their individual schools. Once the suspension is announced, the school day is not cancelled; it is immediately converted into a remote learning day.Students are expected to be ready to transition instantly to digital learning to prevent any interruption in their studies. Students must immediately log onto their designated online learning platforms, such as Madrasati (مدرستي) or other approved digital tools used by their school. Just like in-person attendance, logging into the remote classes is mandatory. Teachers will take attendance, and students must follow the regular class schedule from home. The goal is to keep education flowing while ensuring safety. Students should treat the remote day with the same seriousness as a physical school day.This official ministerial order guarantees two things for the 1447 school year: students' safety is now backed by clear scientific data, and their education will never be truly interrupted. By standardizing these rules, Saudi Arabia has built a more stable and responsive system, ensuring that learning continues, rain or shine.","The Saudi Ministry of Education has issued a formal and highly detailed ministerial order for the 1447 academic year.

Step-by-step: Subscribing to Cloud Miner

Step 1: Get Ready to Bid the initial contracts are made available through an online auction hosted at the designated platform. You must be a UAE resident with a verified ID to participate.

Step 2: Participate in the Auction Bidding for the limited-capacity 24-month contracts runs for a specified period (The initial window was November 3 to 9). You will need to secure a contract through this process to gain access to the service.

Step 3: Account Verification (KYC/AML) To ensure regulatory compliance and security, du requires a strict verification process for all high-value transactions:

UAE Pass: Access to the platform requires verification through your official UAE Pass digital identity. This ensures adherence to local Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Mandatory 2FA is required for all account access, bolstering your security.

Step 4: Commence Mining Once your subscription is secured, your account is verified, and the fixed fees are paid, your cloud mining operation begins immediately from du's secure data centers in the UAE. You receive Bitcoin rewards based on the rented computational power.

What residents should weigh before signing up?

Costs vs rewards: Cloud mining reduces setup costs but fees, uptime, and pool efficiency affect returns read the fee and payout formulas closely.



Payout mechanics: Payouts are reported to be in Bitcoin and routed to users’ wallets ensure you have a compatible wallet and understand tax/reporting requirements in your emirate.

Contract terms & refunds: Check contract length, maintenance fees, and what happens if network difficulty rises or BTC price changes.

Security & trust: Using a large incumbent (du) gives more operational transparency than anonymous cloud-mining sites, but always verify service terms and regulatory disclosures.

Want to mine Bitcoin without the drama of hardware, heat or high bills? UAE residents can now click, subscribe and start earning BTC - no tech skills needed. Du 's new Cloud Miner service, the UAE's first official Cloud Mining as a Service (MaaS) offering from a telecom company, has made Bitcoin mining accessible and compliant for residents.This guide breaks down exactly what the service is, how to get started, and the key benefits of this regulated opportunity.MaaS stands for Mining as a Service. It's a business model that dramatically simplifies the process of cryptocurrency mining, particularly for digital assets like Bitcoin.In a MaaS model, a provider (like Du, with its Cloud Miner) owns and operates all the necessary, specialized mining hardware. They maintain the equipment, manage the high electricity consumption, and ensure the entire operation remains compliant and connected to the blockchain. Essentially, Cloud Miner allows UAE residents to participate in Bitcoin mining by simply subscribing to the output of a professional mining operation, making it an easy-to-digest investment product rather than a technical endeavor.The digital finance landscape in the UAE just got a major upgrade.Telecom giant Du has officially launched a new, revolutionary platform called Cloud Miner, offering residents a straightforward way to participate in the booming world of Bitcoin mining. Revealed on November 2, 2025, during a high-profile launch event at the Burj Khalifa, this service marks a massive first: it is the initial official Cloud Mining as a Service (MaaS) offering from a UAE company.Cloud Miner is a “mining-as-a-service” product under du’s du Tech arm. Each contract sells a fixed amount of hashing power (plans start at 250 terahashes per second (TH/s)), and the mining results are paid out directly in Bitcoin to users’ crypto wallets. du runs the hardware, handles electricity and technical management, and shares the mined Bitcoin with subscribers according to the capacity they hold. This removes the need for users to buy ASIC rigs, arrange power, or manage complex cooling and maintenance.This move is exclusive to UAE residents and instantly expands the digital options available to those looking to grow their investment portfolio within a fully transparent and locally compliant framework. It aligns perfectly with the country’s push to develop robust digital asset and blockchain infrastructure.The initial phase of securing a Cloud Miner contract is done through a specific online process, designed for UAE residents only.A mainstream telecom company offering cloud mining services lowers the entry barrier for ordinary UAE residents and signals the UAE’s continued push to integrate digital-asset services into mainstream infrastructure, while also highlighting the need to strictly follow local rules about where mining can physically operate.","Telecom giant Du has officially launched a new, revolutionary platform called Cloud Miner.

UAE health authorities urge residents aged 50+ to take shingles vaccine for protection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-health-authorities-urge-residents-aged-50-to-take-shingles-vaccine-for-protection/articleshow/125017520.cms,"Turning 50?

Understanding Shingles

Two-Dose Shingrix schedule and coverage

Abu Dhabi Citizens: Eligible citizens holding a Thiqa card can receive the vaccine free of charge at authorized healthcare facilities.

Insured Residents: While not fully subsidized in all emirates, leading health insurers like Daman have recently expanded their coverage to include the Shingrix vaccine under their DHA Compliant Enhanced schemes, making it more accessible to residents with premium policies.





If you’re 50 or older in the UAE, there’s a new health reminder to add to your checklist: the shingles vaccine is now available to help protect you from the painful rash and nerve-related complications caused when the chickenpox virus resurfaces later in life.In a major step to strengthen public health, the UAE's Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP) officially announced the inclusion of the Herpes Zoster vaccine—known commercially as Shingrix—into the national adult vaccination programme. This initiative ensures protection against the highly painful viral infection known as Shingles. The vaccine is now easily accessible at health facilities across all seven emirates. The primary target group for this vital preventive measure includes all UAE residents aged 50 years and older. However, those aged 18 and above who have a weakened immune system due to medical conditions or therapy are also strongly advised to get vaccinated, reflecting a robust, proactive approach to health.Shingles, or herpes zoster, is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, the very same virus responsible for chickenpox.After a person recovers from chickenpox, the virus remains dormant within the nerve tissue and can reactivate years later, often as the immune system naturally weakens with age. The condition typically manifests as a painful skin rash and blisters that emerge on one side of the body. The pain is often described as burning or stabbing. Crucially, Shingles can lead to severe, long-lasting complications, most notably Postherpetic Neuralgia (PHN), a form of chronic nerve pain that can persist for months or even years after the rash has cleared, significantly impacting the quality of life. The vaccine is recommended even for individuals who have previously experienced a Shingles outbreak.The Shingrix vaccine is administered as a two-dose series, maximizing its effectiveness. The second dose is typically scheduled to be received two to six months after the first. Health officials are dedicated to raising public awareness about the importance of adhering to this full two-dose schedule for maximum protection.Regarding cost, coverage varies by emirate and policy:The UAE’s nationwide shingles vaccination rollout reinforces the growing importance of adult immunisation as a core pillar of long-term public health. By proactively prioritising prevention for those most at risk, the country aims to significantly reduce severe cases and improve the overall quality of life for older adults. Individuals aged 50 and above are strongly encouraged to consult their healthcare provider and take timely vaccination to ensure complete and sustained protection.","UAE launches national adult vaccination drive for ages 50+.

Emily Austin’s “Hot Girls for Cuomo” Campaign





""Hot Girls""

The 0,10 and 20 rationale: A misstep in messaging

The New York Post.

The domain fiasco and the campaign’s collapse

The New York Post

A final reckoning: Campaigns and Influence in the digital age





As Zohran Mamdani’s historic victory as New York City’s first Muslim mayor came to fruition, making him the 111th mayor after defeating former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa, an unexpected subplot played out in the final stretch of the campaign: The emergence of “Hot Girls for Zohran,” a movement driven by young women seeking change, was met by a rival “Hot Girls for Cuomo” campaign, launched by conservative influencer Emily Austin. What followed was an ironic spectacle, a classic case of a copycat campaign gone wrongZohran Mamdani’s rise in the mayoral race wasn’t just a victory of ideas, but of a movement. Unlike other campaigns that rely heavily on top-down strategy, Mamdani’s appeal lay in his ability to tap into an undercurrent of frustration felt by many young New Yorkers. Rising housing costs, stagnant wages, and a widening income gap had created a generation of voters who felt shut out of the city they called home.The phrasedidn’t emerge in a vacuum. It was inspired by the viral momentum ofwhich gained traction during Bernie Sanders's 2020 presidential campaign. That movement was born out of a desire to counter the “Bernie Bro” stereotype, an image of Sanders supporters as predominantly male, gruff, and internet-obsessed. Spearheaded by model Emily Ratajkowski , the hashtag aimed to show that young women could be just as invested in Sanders's vision for progressive change.Mamdani’s campaign revived theslogan, but with a twist. It wasn’t about appearance or exclusivity. Instead, it offered a cheeky, non-gendered way for voters to identify with Mamdani’s progressive vision.Typical of New York’s chaotic, impromptu energy, the movement even sparked a Zohran Mamdani lookalike competition, showcasing the candidate’s unexpected stardom and celebrity reach. The movement gained traction fast, spilling out of the ivy-covered walls of Columbia and Barnard and into the streets of New York City as students, celebrities, and everyday New Yorkers helped turn Mamdani’s campaign into a cultural phenomenon, vibrant, unpredictable, and impossible to ignore.What started as a handful of passionate students quickly snowballed, with volunteers canvassing door-to-door, hosting meet-ups, and flooding social media with posts. It wasn’t just a campaign; it became a grassroots groundswell. Merchandise and printed tees bearing the ""Hot Girls for Zohran"" slogan went viral on Instagram, adding a layer of digital fervour to the city's streets.Celebrity endorsements and local activists joined the cause, and soon it wasn’t just about one candidate, it was about a community on fire, united by the belief that Mamdani was the messiah who would deliver them from a city drowning in overpriced rent, artisanal lattes, and $15 avocado toasts.The rise of “Hot Girls for Zohran” did not go unnoticed, especially by the Cuomo camp. With former governor Andrew Cuomo trailing behind Mamdani in the polls, and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa seen as too far removed from the race to be a real contender, there was a sense of urgency in the air. It was at this point that Emily Austin, a 24-year-old conservative influencer, stepped into the fray.Austin, a media-savvy Long Island native known for her right-wing views, launched the “Hot Girls for Cuomo” campaign in late October. Unlike Mamdani’s grassroots movement, Austin’s attempt at creating a political coalition felt more like a branded marketing campaign, aimed at taking advantage of the growingtrend.Her pitch was straightforward, if not a little contrived: “If you’re a hot girl for Andrew Cuomo, I want to hear from you,” she announced in a video posted on X (formerly Twitter). Austin’s use of the term “hot” was designed to grab attention and create a sense of exclusivity. But for her, being “hot” wasn’t just about physical appearance; it was about intelligence and aligning with what she viewed as common sense.She tried to frame Cuomo as the antidote to Mamdani’s “socialism,” repeatedly voicing her belief that Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa should drop out to give Cuomo a better chance of defeating Mamdani. In her view, voting for Sliwa was, effectively, voting for Mamdani, a sentiment she voiced on X, insisting that Cuomo was the only viable option to stop the socialist candidate.But therein lay the flaw in Austin’s approach. Where Mamdani’s campaign had successfully mobilised people based on shared political goals and values, Austin’s initiative came across as a surface-level stunt. The idea that political allegiance could be reduced to physical attractivenes, however tongue-in-cheek—undermined the sincerity of the movement. Austin’s branding took the slogan literally: “Hot Girls” were to be identified by their looks, and, by extension, their support for Cuomo was tied to their perceived “common sense. ” The implication was that anyone who supported Mamdani was, quite simply, a “zero.”Austin’s campaign was grounded in the idea that supporting Cuomo would somehow elevate women, casting them as more desirable and intellectually sound in comparison to those backing Mamdani. “I don’t care if you’re the hottest girl physically, if you’re voting for Mamdani, you’re a zero because clearly you lack IQ,” she toldOne could argue that Mamdani’s campaign also attracted its share of attractive figures, but for Austin, the focus was different. Her approach revolved around leveraging beauty as political capital, casting voting for Cuomo as a way to increase one’s perceived worth. In Austin’s equation, a “10” who voted for Mamdani became a “0,” while a “10” backing Cuomo became a “20.” It was a logic rooted in appearance, not policy, attempting to turn attractiveness into an endorsement of political ideology.It’s likely that Austin, much like some of the influencers who backed Mamdani, was hoping for a bandwagon effect, a trend of beauty queens and “tens” following along to sway the voter base. The idea was that by seducing the electorate with the right looks, she could push Cuomo into a stronger position. However, this strategy backfired, reducing the political conversation to superficiality and undermining any substantive engagement with the issues at hand.In the end, Austin’s focus on beauty, rather than substance, only alienated potential supporters, turning her campaign into an object lesson in how not to mobilise voters.But the campaign's missteps didn’t end with Austin’s messaging. In a move that perfectly encapsulated the disorganised nature of her campaign, Austin forgot to secure the domain name for “Hot Girls for Cuomo.” In an era where digital presence is just as crucial as the message itself, this was a critical oversight. As she admitted to, “I didn’t know ‘Hot Girls for Cuomo’ needed a site… and if I had ever foresaw that, of course I would’ve bought the domain.”Before she could even begin to build a website or establish a legitimate digital platform, an anti-Cuomo activist swiftly snatched up the domain name HotGirlsForCuomo.com. Instead of leading to Austin’s campaign, the website redirected visitors to a page detailing the New York Attorney General Letitia James's investigation into Andrew Cuomo’s sexual harassment allegations.The 2021 report, which Cuomo has denied, revealed a pattern of inappropriate behaviour, including unwanted touching, sexually suggestive comments, and other advances made by Cuomo towards multiple women during his time in office. The report also stated that Cuomo’s actions were not limited to staff members but extended to state employees and members of the public, including a State Trooper assigned to his detail.This catastrophic blunder added to the growing irony surrounding Austin’s campaign. She had been outmanoeuvred by a domain name purchase, and what was intended to be a catchy political stunt was now inexorably tethered to one of the darkest chapters of Cuomo's career, thrusting his sexual harassment scandal, which resulted in his resignation as governor, back into the spotlight.Emily Austin’s “Hot Girls for Cuomo” campaign, which was meant to rival “Hot Girls for Zohran,” quickly unravelled under the weight of its own contradictions. While Mamdani’s movement grew organically, with a focus on tangible political change, Austin’s influencer-led campaign collapsed under its own superficiality.For all her media-savvy, Austin underestimated the depth of political engagement in New York City, particularly among young women who felt a deep connection to Mamdani’s promises. The focus on looks and intelligence made her campaign seem dismissive of voters' genuine concerns. Mamdani, on the other hand, mobilised his supporters with a clear message of change and inclusivity, not with slogans built around physical appearance.While “Hot Girls for Zohran” was about rallying diverse supporters behind Mamdani’s vision for a fairer city, “Hot Girls for Cuomo” fell flat, exposed by a lack of authenticity and an ill-conceived strategy. In the end, Mamdani’s victory was a testament to the power of genuine political movements, while Austin’s campaign served as a cautionary tale of how a shallow, copy-paste campaign can fail when it misses the real issues that matter most.However, Austin still, undeterred by her campaign's failure, has already hinted at her next project: “Hot Girls for Vance,” aiming to back JD Vance in a potential 2028 presidential run. She commented, “I’m starting a ‘Hot Girls for Vance.’ I’m now gonna ride this wave.”","Zohran Mamdani became New York City’s first Muslim mayor after defeating former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.





When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

What Spotify said about the lawsuit



“nonsense.”

Spotify is facing a new class action lawsuit. Filed in the New York federal court, the lawsuit alleges that the Swedish music streaming company uses asystem that dictates music recommendations and playlist placement. The suit claims this system favours major-label tracks, causing problems for users who expect recommendations based on their listening history. The issue came to light when a Spotify user, Genevieve Capolongo, noted that despite her interest in lesser-known indie artists, the platform repeatedly recommended mainstream tracks from artists like Drake , Zach Bryan, and Justin Bieber According to a report by The Hollywood Reporter, the lawsuit alleges that Spotify engaged in deceptive practices and false advertising, among other claims. It seeks unspecified damages and a court order to block Spotify from using paid arrangements to influence playlist and recommendation placements. This lawsuit also requests that Spotify be required to disclose when promotions influence songs on the platform.Spotify has become an important platform for music discovery through two kinds of playlists: editorial, curated by staff, and algorithmic, generated by its recommendation system.Both influence what listeners hear, as being featured on major playlists such as Rap Caviar or Today’s Top Hits can significantly increase an artist’s visibility and earnings.According to the lawsuit, placement on playlists can cost between $2,000 and $10,000, with some payments labelled asThe complaint says independent artists are at a disadvantage because major labels, through licensing agreements, gain better access to these playlists and receive preferential treatment in recommendations.The lawsuit also targets Spotify’s Discovery Mode, which was introduced by the company in 2020. This feature allows artists to promote songs on algorithmic playlists in exchange for reduced royalty payments rather than direct fees.Critics have compared this to the pay-for-play schemes that once affected the radio industry. Drake referenced this feature in a lawsuit against UMG, criticising lower royalties for greater exposure.The House Judiciary Committee has also expressed concern that Discovery Mode couldpushing artists to accept lower payouts to remain visible in a competitive environment.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai celebrates new breakthrough in quantum algorithm; Elon Musk replies: ‘Looks like…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-celebrates-new-breakthrough-in-quantum-algorithm-elon-musk-replies-looks-like/articleshow/124754841.cms,"



What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently shared a post on X, formerly Twitter, announcing a new breakthrough in quantum algorithms. “Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage,” Pichai wrote in the post, adding it is “13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers”. Pichai’s post caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk . The tech billionaire replied to Pichai’s post saying “Congrats. Looks like quantum computing is becoming relevant.”Announcing the major breakthrough, Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote:The achievement marks a historic breakthrough in quantum computing. For the first time ever, a quantum computer has performed a complex, verifiable calculation faster than any supercomputer could — about 13,000 times faster. This moment is being called a “verifiable quantum advantage.""Using Google’s Willow quantum chip, researchers ran an advanced algorithm called Quantum Echoes (or OTOC — out-of-order time correlator).This algorithm helps scientists study how information spreads in quantum systems — things like molecules, magnets, or even black holes.The key part: the result was verifiable and repeatable, meaning other quantum computers could confirm it independently.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently shared a post on X, formerly Twitter, announcing a new breakthrough in quantum algorithms.

‘Rough news but…’: Netflix shuts down studio behind game that hit number 1 in 26 countries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/rough-news-but-netflix-shuts-down-studio-behind-game-that-hit-number-1-in-26-countries/articleshow/124805503.cms,"Netflix shift in gaming strategy







Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including Squid Game Unleased which hit #1 in 26 countries. You’ll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles – they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through. As for Bill, Scott and me – we’re going to take a little breather before tackling whatever is next. Love to hear from you if there’s anything interesting going on, workwise or otherwise.Another employee, David Luehmann, a director of game development at the studio, also posted on LinkedIn, saying, ""After 10+ great years working at Boss Fight, the last few as part of Netflix, the time has come for the studio to close down.""“I am very proud of all the people, work, and games we've released. I wish you could see what we had cooking! There are many talented people that have been impacted by this. If anyone is looking to grow, I'll have many recommendations for you!” he added.Netflix acquired Boss Fight Entertainment in 2022 as part of its effort to diversify revenue streams by building out its video game offerings, news agency Reuters reported.The studio was known for developing two games available on the platform: Netflix Stories and the highly successful Squid Game: Unleashed, which reportedly hit the number one spot in 26 countries.The streaming giant's move follows an earnings call earlier this week where Co-CEO Greg Peters specifically praised Squid Game: Unleashed as an example of the kind of narrative game the company wanted to create based on its original shows.However, the company, which named Alain Tascan as president of games last year, is implementing a new strategy that will focus on four specific categories: party, narrative, kids, and mainstream games, the report added. The studio’s closure signals a realignment of resources toward this updated focus.Despite the shutdown, Boss Fight's two games, Netflix Stories and Squid Game: Unleashed, will continue to be available on the Netflix platform.","Boss Fight Entertainment's co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week.

Engineers’ biggest 'headache' is now Collins Dictionary’s Word of the Year 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/engineers-biggest-headache-is-now-collins-dictionarys-word-of-the-year-2025/articleshow/125135909.cms,"The numbers tell a startling story about AI's takeover





The term that sent shivers down programmers' spines just months ago has become Collins Dictionary's word of the year for 2025: ""vibe coding."" It describes something once unthinkable—building apps and websites by chatting with AI instead of writing code line by painstaking line. OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy coined the phrase in February, urging developers to ""give in to the vibes"" and ""forget the code even exists."" Collins picked it after usage exploded across tech circles and beyond.Anyone can now spin up basic software by telling AI what they want: ""Build me a meal planner"" or ""Create a fitness tracker."" Even Google's CEO Sundar Pichai is dabbling, using tools like Cursor and Replit to build a custom news aggregator. ""It feels so delightful to be a coder in this moment,"" he told Bloomberg Tech in June, his enthusiasm barely contained.The shift is rewriting Silicon Valley's rules. Y Combinator chief Garry Tan puts it bluntly: 10 vibe coders can now match the output of 100 traditional engineers. His accelerator's numbers back it up—a quarter of current startups let AI write 95% of their code. Where founders once needed armies of engineers and mountains of venture capital, they're now launching with lean teams and AI doing the heavy lifting.""That's such a powerful moment in software,"" Tan told CNBC.But here's where it gets serious. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella dropped a bombshell in April: AI now writes up to 30% of the company's code, and that figure keeps climbing. At Google, Pichai revealed in October that more than a quarter of new code springs from AI, not human fingers on keyboards. These aren't experimental side projects—this is production code running services used by billions.Meta's Mark Zuckerberg is betting even bigger. He predicts half of his company's development will be AI-driven within a year, with the company building AI models specifically designed to develop other AI models. The tech giants aren't just using AI as a helper—they're fundamentally rewiring how software gets made.Not everyone's celebrating. OpenAI's Sam Altman warned in March that demand for software engineers could eventually dip as AI handles more grunt work. Each developer will simply ""do much, much more for a while,"" he said, before adding the stark reality: ""And then at some point, yeah, maybe we do need less software engineers.""The shift is already visible in corporate cuts. Companies from Amazon to Salesforce have cited AI when slashing thousands of jobs. Still, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang argues AI is the ""great equalizer,"" turning natural language into a new programming tool. ""There's a new programming language,"" he told London Tech Week. ""It's called 'human.'""""Vibe coding"" beat out other tech-flavored contenders including ""clanker""—slang for frustrating AI bots—""broligarchy"" for tech billionaires wielding political power, and ""aura farming"" for performing coolness on camera.Collins' Alex Beecroft called it a snapshot of ""how language is evolving alongside technology,"" marking the moment when talking to machines became as natural as typing commands.","""Vibe coding"" is Collins Dictionary's word of the year for 2025. It describes building apps and websites by chatting with AI instead of writing code. The shift is rewriting Silicon Valley's rules.
