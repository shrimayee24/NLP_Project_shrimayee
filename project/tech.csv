Vlog 19: Ups And Downs

The former New York Giants star and TV personality broke down in tears as he shared the most terrifying chapter of his life‚Äîwatching his daughter fight brain cancer. In Life Interrupted, an ABC special to be released soon, Strahan shares the raw and painful emotions of watching his 19-year-old daughter get diagnosed with medulloblastoma-an aggressive form of brain cancer-in October 2023. The trailer of the documentary captures his heartbreak as he recalls the moment he first heard the diagnosis:Strahan, known for his dominance in the NFL, found himself in unfamiliar territory‚Äîone where his strength and skills meant nothing. His daughter‚Äôs battle wasn‚Äôt one he could fight for her. The seven-time Pro Bowler admitted his fear, saying,No game plan, no strategy‚Äîjust helplessness as he watched Isabella struggle through a grueling fight for her life.Before cancer sent her world spinning, Isabella was cutting out a niche for herself in the modeling world, strutting down the Sherri Hill runway with poise. After then enduring torturous brain surgery, she had to learn to walk and talk again‚Äîan utterly impossible hurdle for an otherwise vibrant young woman whose entire future lay before her. In the movie trailer, Isabella's poignant words strike like a sledgehammer:Isabella never let the cancer diagnosis define her. She attacked chemotherapy and radiation treatments with a determination that mirrored her father once battling relentless NFL defenses. By July 2024, it paid off. Doctors declared her cancer-free, and she didn't waste a minute returning to USC for her sophomore year, ready to reclaim her dreams.However, her journey did not only change her; it changed her dad. According to Strahan: ""This gave him a new life perspective:Isabella isn't just moving forward; she's turning her journey into a source of inspiration and support for others. Through her YouTube vlogs, she shares her experiences with honesty and resilience, offering hope to those facing similar battles. But she doesn‚Äôt stop there‚Äîshe‚Äôs also actively raising funds for the, ensuring that patients and their families have access to the resources, treatment, and support they need. By using her voice and platform, Isabella is making a real impact, proving that even in the face of adversity, one person can spark meaningful change.As for Strahan, life has thrown him plenty of challenges, but none compare to this. Now a proud grandfather and an even prouder father, he watches Isabella move forward‚Äîstronger, wiser, and ready to take on the world.And if there's one thing we can learn from Isabella Strahan, it's that true strength isn't just about surviving‚Äîit's about thriving.

When and where to watch tonight‚Äôs game between the Memphis Grizzlies and the Houston Rockets (January 30, 2025)?

is officially listed as ‚Äúquestionable‚Äù for Thursday night's game against the Houston Rockets due to a lingering shoulder injury. The Grizzlies, currently sitting at 31-16, will face the Rockets (32-14) at FedEx Forum at 9:30 PM ET in a crucial Western Conference matchup. Ja Morant ‚Äôs uncertain status adds to Memphis‚Äô growing injury concerns. Cam Spencer (thumb), Marcus Smart (finger), and Vince Williams Jr. (ankle) are already ruled out, leaving the Grizzlies shorthanded against a formidable Rockets squad. If Morant is unable to play, Memphis will have to rely more on Jaren Jackson Jr. and Desmond Bane, who have been key contributors over the last 20 games.Jackson Jr. is averaging 23.9 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 3.1 assists, while Bane has been a playmaking force with 19.9 points and 6.3 assists per game. With Ja Morant's potential absence, the backcourt responsibilities could shift further to Luke Kennard and Scotty Pippen Jr.Morant, a two-time All-Star, is a game-changer for Memphis, providing elite scoring and playmaking. His explosiveness allows the Grizzlies to push the pace, something they‚Äôve thrived on while averaging 123.3 points per game‚Äîthe highest in the NBA. Without him, Memphis could struggle to generate the same level of offensive efficiency.Additionally, the Memphis Grizzlies face a Houston team that excels defensively, ranking fifth in the league in points allowed (108.2 per game). The Rockets also dominate the boards, leading the NBA with 48.1 rebounds per game, which could pose challenges for Memphis‚Äô smaller lineup if Ja Morant sits out.The Rockets have their own injury struggles, with Jabari Smith Jr. (hand) ruled out, while Alperen Sengun (calf) and Steven Adams (ankle) remain questionable. Sengun, Houston‚Äôs leading rebounder at 10.1 boards per game, would be a major loss if unavailable.The Memphis Grizzlies will likely make a game-time decision on Ja Morant‚Äôs availability. If he plays, Memphis will have a much-needed boost in their backcourt battle against Jalen Green (24.3 PPG) and Fred VanVleet (5.6 APG). If not, they‚Äôll have to adjust their game plan and lean on Jackson Jr. and Bane to carry the offense.Also read: Will Darius Garland play tonight against the Atlanta Hawks?

Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic. In his memoir, Spare, the Duke of Sussex talks about reaching out to a medium with supernatural abilities to communicate with Diana, who passed away in a car accident in Paris in 1997, just before his 13th birthday, The Mirror reported.The Duke received a message from his mother through the psychic, who told him, ""You're living the life she wanted for you."" Harry, now 40, says that the medium also told him his mother was with him ""right now,"" which made his neck warm and his eyes fill with tears. The psychic shared that Diana knew Harry was ""looking for clarity"" and ""feels your confusion."" She added that Diana understood Harry had ""so many questions"" and that answers would come in time.Another anecdote involved Prince Harry‚Äôs son, Archie. The psychic reportedly described how Diana‚Äôs spirit witnessed Archie accidentally breaking a Christmas tree ornament shaped like Queen Elizabeth. When asked, Harry admitted the incident had occurred, adding that Archie had attempted to fix the ornament.The medium suggested Diana found humour in the situation, delighting in the antics of her grandson she never had the chance to meet.In Spare, Prince Harry also recounts an extraordinary encounter with a leopard during a trip to Botswana with his brother, Prince William. He interpreted the animal‚Äôs presence as a comforting sign from his late mother, suggesting that ""everything will be fine."" However, the experience was not without fear, as he briefly worried the leopard might attack.Harry has been candid about the psychological toll of losing Diana so young.

'Forgot to change the label': DeepSeek AI accused of copying ChatGPT,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/forgot-to-change-the-label-deepseek-ai-accused-of-copying-chatgpt-the-best-memes-and-jokes/articleshow/117741027.cms,"Here are the best memes from the internet

If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, OpenAI might be feeling very flattered right now. Social media is ablaze with accusations that China's DeepSeek AI is essentially ChatGPT with a new coat of paint‚Äîor maybe not even that new. Users quickly noticed some suspiciously familiar design choices, with one even spotting an alleged OpenAI reference left in the code. Naturally, the internet responded in the only way it knows how: with a flood of memes, jokes, and plenty of Spider-Man pointing references.One user shared a screenshot of DeepSeek‚Äôs chat options, highlighting that one of them still mentioned OpenAI. ‚ÄúThe Chinese dudes forgot to remove the OpenAI ChatGPTapp reference from the code they copied or reverse-engineered,‚Äù the user wrote, tagging OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Others quickly piled on, mocking DeepSeek‚Äôs resemblance to ChatGPT. ‚ÄúDeepSeek is impressive, but the app is so shamelessly a 1:1 copy of ChatGPT. Even the border radius, colours, iconography, and font just scream ChatGPT,‚Äù another user remarked.The discussion also sparked debates on AI censorship , with some users noting how both ChatGPT and DeepSeek refuse to answer certain queries, albeit on different topics. ‚ÄúChatGPT refuses to write on certain topics. DeepSeek refuses to write on other topics. When ChatGPT rejects your request, ask DeepSeek, then copy the response to ChatGPT, and it‚Äôll answer. Competition is good for free speech,‚Äù one user pointed out.Memes flooded the discussion, with users comparing DeepSeek to a ‚Äúcopy of a copy.‚Äù One meme featured the famous Spider-Man pointing meme, captioned: ‚ÄúSame, same but different! Did DeepSeek copy ChatGPT's UI verbatim? LOL.‚Äù Others speculated about how DeepSeek was trained, with one user joking, ‚ÄúDeepSeek sometimes thinks it‚Äôs ChatGPT and sometimes Claude. It shows DeepSeek is using ChatGPT and Claude without spending R&D costs for its training.‚Äù Another user quipped: ‚ÄúCopying efficiency from DeepSeek, who borrowed ChatGPT IP with smuggled NVIDIA hardware via Singapore.‚ÄùThe uproar comes as OpenAI and US officials raise concerns over DeepSeek‚Äôs rapid advancements, questioning whether its AI was developed using OpenAI‚Äôs proprietary data. OpenAI has not directly accused DeepSeek of intellectual property theft but has warned that Chinese companies are attempting to ‚Äúdistill‚Äù knowledge from US AI models. This practice involves using an existing AI model to train another, a technique OpenAI explicitly bans in its terms of service.David Sacks, an AI adviser to former President Donald Trump, weighed in on the matter, stating, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs substantial evidence that what DeepSeek did here is they distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI‚Äôs models. And I don‚Äôt think OpenAI is very happy about this.‚Äù Meanwhile, DeepSeek has not responded to requests for comment, coinciding with China‚Äôs extended Lunar New Year holiday.Despite OpenAI‚Äôs concerns, some users mocked the company's stance, pointing out its own history of scraping data without permission. ‚ÄúOpenAI thinks that only OpenAI should be allowed to train on data without permission,‚Äù one user noted. Another shared a meme featuring the rage face, captioned: ‚ÄúWe will obviously deliver much better models.‚Äù","China's DeepSeek AI is accused of copying OpenAI's ChatGPT chat app. One user even spotted an alleged OpenAI reference left in the code.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

DeepSeek is a hot topic on earnings calls this quarter. And it was no different at AT&T's earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2024. AT&T CEO John Stankey was asked about DeepSeek that shocked US stock market earlier this week, wiping out billions from market capital of technology companies led by AI chip giant Nvidia.AT&T CEO Stankey was asked about the impact of Deepseek and if the company planned to use cloud and AI to both improve relationships with customers, improve product and lowering their overall expenses.To this Stankey replied, ""We‚Äôve used it a lot internally in our operations. We‚Äôre seeing demonstrative improvements in our code effectiveness. And I shared this on a previous call, we‚Äôre spending less right now to develop new code internally and getting more. And it‚Äôs through the application of AI and the technology and what we‚Äôre able to do with generative AI.""Commenting further on the impact of DeepSeek, he said,""I would expect for a nascent technology like this that we‚Äôre going to have those moments because necessity is the mother of invention.

Italy has become the first country to block DeepSeek . A report claims that the Chinese artificial intelligence app has been removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in the country. This action follows a request for information from the Italian data protection authority about the app's use of personal data.A notice on Apple's App Store started informing Italian users that the DeepSeek app was ""currently not available in the country or area."" Similarly, Google's Play Store also displayed a message stating that the download was ""not supported"" in Italy, the report noted.However, DeepSeek remained accessible for Italian users who had previously downloaded it and was still available for download and functioning in other European Union countries and the UK, the report added.In a statement to the news agency ANSA (seen by Reuters), Pasquale Stanzione, the head of the Italian data regulator confirmed the removal of the DeepSeek app from Apple and Google‚Äôs respective app stores.He said:Stanzione also mentioned that the EU‚Äôs leading AI watchdog that previously temporarily banned ChatGPT over suspected privacy violations, Garante, has requested details on the collection of personal data. This includes its sources, purposes, legal basis and whether it is stored in China. DeepSeek and its affiliated companies have been given 20 days to respond.He also emphasised that the regulator is seeking assurances regarding safeguards for underage users, measures to prevent bias, and protections against electoral interference, the report added.DeepSeek, which launched a free AI assistant last week, quickly gained popularity, even surpassing ChatGPT in downloads on Apple's App Store. However, concerns about data privacy have led to this ban in Italy, the report claims.Apart from this, Ireland's Data Protection Commission has also requested information about DeepSeek's data processing practices.Moreover, a spokesperson for the interior ministry of Germany stated that the government is monitoring AI apps for potential interference ahead of the national election on February 23.Without naming any specific models, the spokesperson said:",Italy has become the first country to block DeepSeek.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle‚Äôs theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you‚Äôve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you‚Äôve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.
