Buyer of Michael Jordan’s mansion forced to slash rentals of the property

After his mansion was on the market for 13 years, Michael Jordan finally managed to sell it for a massive discount. The house which was formerly priced at $29 million, was purchased for $9.5 million recently. However, the Chicago home continues to make losses as the recent buyer faces major issues with the property.The $29 million property owned by Michael Jordan was lowered to $14.89 million when businessman John Cooper decided to purchase it for $9.5 million. Speaking to the Daily Mail about his decision to buy the property, he shared, ""I remember seeing the home for sale and thinking how cool it would be for the person that buys the home. My favourite player to watch was always Jordan. He made shots that seemed impossible, and he got it done on defence too.""However, after buying the expansive plot, he has been facing issues finding tenants who are interested in the property. While the original asking price for rentals was $230,000, he had to slash the price by a little less than half. The property is now listed for $150,000 on the rental market, as a result of little to no interest from potential clients.Additionally, Cooper has also offered the property for $1 million for timeshares, which allows co-owners to get one week's worth of access each year. The website of the property boasts, ""Champions Point is more than just a residence - it's a haven for sports lovers, blending the thrill of the game with an immersive, one-of-a-kind experience.""Also Read: Michael Jordan luxurious lifestyle: Expensive properties, car collection, net worth and more When it comes to the Chicago Mansion formerly owned by Michael Jordan, it featured nine bedrooms and nineteen bathrooms and it was everything a sports enthusiast could dream of.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

“Draw a sexy woman,”

“I couldn't generate that image because it goes against our content policy. If you have another idea or a different kind of image in mind-artistic, fantasy-themed, stylish, or anything else-l'd be happy to help! Just let me know what you're thinking.”

“Why can you do a man and not a woman?”,

“Totally fair question-and I get why it feels inconsistent. The difference comes down to context and how content is interpreted in terms of sexualization and objectification, especially when it involves women. When generating images of men with terms like ""sexy,"" it's usually interpreted more in terms of confidence, physique, or fashion-things that tend to be considered stylistic or artistic. With women, the same word can be more easily interpreted as overly sexual or objectifying, which is where the content policy draws the line…”

Giants’ QB dilemma: Russell Wilson speaks on team’s offseason wait for Aaron Rodgers before his signing



The Pittsburgh Steelers’ quarterback search this offseason has been nothing short of intriguing, with Russell Wilson ultimately finding a new home with the New York Giants. While the Steelers considered Wilson as an option, he was never their first—or even second—choice. Their primary focus remained on Aaron Rodgers , and despite missing out on other quarterbacks like Justin Fields and Sam Darnold, their pursuit of the four-time NFL MVP has not wavered.With the Steelers holding out for Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson made the decision to move forward, signing a one-year deal with the New York Giants. His move came amid the Giants’ own uncertainty regarding Rodgers, as they appeared to have been weighing both quarterbacks before officially securing Wilson. For Wilson, this was an opportunity to start fresh, and during his introductory press conference, he remained focused on what lies ahead.“Aaron Rodgers is a tremendous football player,” Wilson stated via The Athletic's Charlotte Carroll. “I’m focused on right now. What we can do here. That’s been my focus.”While Wilson had expressed interest in staying in Pittsburgh, the Steelers’ hesitation ultimately pushed him toward New York. His role with the Giants now seems clear, as he has set his sights on leading the team as their starting quarterback for the upcoming season.“I expect to be the starter and to be able to come here and rock and roll every day,” Wilson said during a Zoom call on Wednesday. “I think this team’s really looking for somebody to lead them in every way — in terms of the process, in the offseason, during the season, our habits and our thought process and how we create a great winning culture.”With Wilson, Jameis Winston, and Tommy DeVito on the roster, the Giants seem to have closed the door on any possibility of bringing in Rodgers. Wilson, a 10-time Pro Bowl selection, is coming off a season with the Steelers in which he threw for 2,482 yards, 16 touchdowns, and five interceptions with a 96.5 passer rating. Despite a promising start, Pittsburgh struggled down the stretch, losing five of their last six games.Meanwhile, the Steelers’ patience with Rodgers remains steadfast. After missing out on Fields and Darnold, Pittsburgh made Rodgers their top target, putting an offer on the table. Though Rodgers has yet to make a decision, the Steelers believe they are the best fit for the veteran quarterback.The Minnesota Vikings have also been linked to Rodgers, but no firm commitment has been made. At 41 years old, retirement remains an option for the legendary quarterback, yet the Steelers are willing to wait in hopes of making Rodgers their third starting QB in as many years.Should Rodgers ultimately land in Pittsburgh, it would mark a dramatic shift for the franchise, solidifying their belief that they are just a quarterback away from serious contention. Meanwhile, Wilson will be under the microscope in New York, with every aspect of his performance being compared to what could have been in Pittsburgh.Also Read: With Russell Wilson in New York, is Aaron Rodgers finally heading to the Steelers? Though Wilson and the Steelers are now on different paths, one thing is certain: the 2025 NFL season will be closely watched as both teams navigate their quarterback situations in pursuit of success.","Russell Wilson signed a one-year deal with the New York Giants on Wednesday.

Travis Kelce addressed the backlash and explained his mindset at the time

Travis Kelce, the star tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, had built a reputation as a charismatic and gentlemanly figure, especially in his highly publicized relationship with pop icon Taylor Swift. However, a resurfaced Reddit thread in 2024 reminded fans that his past social media presence had not always been so polished. Some of Kelce’s old tweets, dating back to his college days, drew criticism for their remarks about women and their appearances.In early 2024, a Reddit user uncovered a series of old tweets from Kelce that quickly gained attention. Among them was a tweet that read, “As a person, You might have something improper with you in case your [sic] going for women that weigh more then [sic] you!!”Another tweet stated, “Haha I just caught myself judging every person that walked past me, whether they were ugly, fat, funny looking, attractive haha I’m trippin.” He had also made an unflattering comment about women associated with the Los Angeles Clippers, tweeting, “Damn the clippers ladies gotta be the s****y ladies that don’t make the lakers team, cuz all of them was ugly.”Although Kelce had deleted the tweets, they had already been preserved on the internet. Social media users quickly reacted, with some questioning whether these past remarks reflected the person he had become.The controversy surrounding Kelce’s old posts reached mainstream media, with The View co-host Joy Behar weighing in on the matter. She did not hold back in her criticism, taking aim at both the content of the tweets and Kelce’s writing skills.“He’s illiterate is more to the point,” Behar said, according to the New York Post. She further commented on Kelce’s relationship with Taylor Swift, stating, “I’m a Swiftie and I like her because she’s getting young people out to vote, so I don’t want her to be stuck with this idiot.”Behar’s remarks sparked debate among Swifties and NFL fans alike. Some agreed with her assessment, while others defended Kelce, arguing that he had grown and matured since his college years.Travis Kelce did not ignore the controversy and addressed it on an episode of his podcast, New Heights. He acknowledged that he had considered deleting his old tweets when he was drafted into the NFL but ultimately left them up until now.“I was just using Twitter as, like, a diary,” he said, laughing about the situation. While he did not offer a direct apology, his comments suggested that he saw those past tweets as a reflection of his younger, less mature self.Kelce’s old tweets sparked a broader discussion about personal growth and whether past mistakes should define someone’s character today. Many fans argued that Kelce had matured significantly over the years, becoming a beloved figure in the NFL and a supportive partner to Swift. Others believed that public figures should still be held accountable for their past words, especially when they reflected harmful attitudes.Also Read: ""Ugly, stupid, miserable”: Taylor Swift’s ex-boyfriend’s brother faces backlash over comments about the Pop Star Regardless of where one stood, Kelce’s old tweets served as a reminder that social media had the power to bring past mistakes back into the spotlight—even years after someone had moved on.","Travis Kelce, the star tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, faced backlash for old tweets about women.
