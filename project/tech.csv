Inside Josh Allen’s SUPER SIZED Car Collection

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen has built a reputation as one of the NFL’s most dominant player, but his success off the field is just as visible - especially when it comes to what’s parked in his garage. From rugged trucks built for harsh Buffalo winters to high-end luxury and speed machines, Allen’s car collection reflects both his personality and his journey from small-town roots to NFL superstardom.Allen’s rise in the NFL has been matched by a major financial leap. After signing a six-year, $258 million contract extension with the Bills in 2021, the quarterback gained the freedom to indulge in his love for powerful vehicles. Yet, his choices suggest balance rather than excess. Many of Allen’s cars are built for utility and durability, fitting for a quarterback who plays in one of the league’s coldest markets.One of the cars of his garage is the Jeep Grand Wagoneer, a full-size SUV powered by a twin-turbo V8 engine. With all-wheel drive and a spacious, luxury-filled interior, it’s a practical choice for Buffalo winters while still offering premium comfort.Allen has never hidden his appreciation for trucks, a nod to his upbringing in Firebaugh, California. His Ford F-150 Raptor, customized in an all-black finish, stands out as one of the most rugged vehicles he owns. Equipped with a powerful V8 engine and impressive ground clearance, the Raptor is built for tough terrain and poor weather, ideal for Western New York conditions.Adding to the SUV-heavy lineup is the Range Rover Sport, which blends performance, off-road ability, and luxury. With a refined interior and strong engine options, the Range Rover offers Allen a smoother, more polished driving experience without sacrificing strength.Allen’s garage also features vehicles that lean more toward style and speed. The Mercedes-Benz G-Wagon, known for its boxy design and elite status, brings both luxury and brute force. Its V8 engine and plush interior make it a favorite among elite athletes, and Allen is no exception.Josh Allen also owns a Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat. With nearly 800 horsepower under the hood, the Hellcat is the most aggressive car in his collection, designed for straight-line speed and raw performance.Rounding out the collection is Allen’s most exotic ride, the Aston Martin Vantage. Sleek, fast, and unmistakably premium, the Vantage represents Allen’s taste for high-end performance cars. With a 0-60 mph time in just three seconds, it stands apart from his trucks and SUVs, highlighting a taste for refined speed.Josh Allen’s car collection isn’t about flash alone. It mirrors his journey grounded, powerful, and versatile.","Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen has built a reputation as one of the NFL’s most dominant player.

The state of AI adoption





American billionaire and entrepreneur Mark Cuban has now urged the young engineers entering the job market to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (MNCs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI). Cuban feels that smaller companies offer better platform for new graduates to make an immediate impact, while large corporations often dilute individual contributions.Speaking in an interview with CNBC and on his podcast The Dumbest Guy in the Room, Cuban explained that smaller companies are mainly entrepreneur-driven and they lack the deep IT departments or larger corporations. This gap creates opportunities for fresh graduates which directly contribute to the AI projects.“Small- to medium-size companies don’t have that depth. They are typically entrepreneurially driven and don’t have the flexibility to have people research things. Bringing a new graduate on to work on agentic AI projects is inexpensive for them and can get them immediate results,” Cuban said.Cuban also used the example of his own company, Cost Plus Drugs, noting how AI can automate processes to boost productivity, competitiveness, and profitability.Cuban argued that in big organisations, AI skills may not stand out as they are common among thousands of IT employees. On the other hand, in smaller firms often lack such expertise, making new graduates with AI knowledge invaluable. He also compared the present wave of AI with early days of the internet, when young engineers were hired to implement new technologies because they were more comfortable with them than older executives.Cuban also highlighted that 95% of companies have not yet seen measurable revenue returns from AI investments. The exceptions, he said, are mostly early-stage startups led by young entrepreneurs who design their processes around AI models tailored to their businesses.He urged his children and other young people to learn as much as possible about AI, stressing that companies are still grappling with how to use the technology for competitive advantage.",Mark Cuban has urged young engineers to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (MNCs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence.

Gates believes artificial intelligence could be a solution to misinformation





Microsoft founder Bill Gates has now acknowledged that he was ‘very wrong’ in assuming that making information widely available would naturally lead people to seek out accurate facts. Speaking in an interview with CNBC, Gates said that the had been quite naive to believe that access to information alone would curb misinformation. But now he sees that as a growing problem which is being passed on the younger generation. Gates admitted that he underestimated the appeal of confirmation bias, the tendency for people to gravitate toward platforms and connect which reinforce their present views. ““When we made information available, I thought people would want correct information,” Gates said. “But even I wallow. If there’s a politician I don’t like, and there’s an article criticizing him—even if exaggerated—I enjoy reading it.”Gates perspective further shifted after heading his daughter Phoebe Gates description. Phoebe described how she was harassed online underscoring the personal toll of misinformation and online abuse. Phoebe who is also the co-founder of AI shopping tool Phia, has previously spoken about being “memed” for her interracial relationship, highlighting how misinformation and online ridicule can distort public perception.Gates believes that artificial intelligence could play an important role in combating misinformation and handling deepfakes. He emphasised that AI systems might be used to enforce rules and regulations around harmful content such as incitement to violence or vaccine misinformation available online.“We should have free speech. But if you’re inciting violence, if you’re causing people not to take vaccines, where are those boundaries? Even the U.S. should have rules. And if you have rules, is it some AI that encodes those rules?” Gates asked.Gates also acknowledged that the fight against misinformation will be cyclical, with new detection methods constantly challenged by countermeasures. In a 2023 blog post, Gates wrote: “It won’t be a perfect success, but we won’t be helpless either.”","Gates believes that artificial intelligence could play an important role in combating misinformation and handling deepfakes.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu was recently asked by an X (formerly Twitter) user why there is no talk about Arattai now?

We are geared for it.”To recall, the Arattai app debuted in 2021 as a rival to Meta’s WhatsApp. Years after its launch, the app recently gained momentum after senior government ministers like Piyush Goyal joined the platform.

Microsoft CEO 'Thrilled' About India's Growing Data Centre Capacity, Details Meet With PM Modi

Microsoft reorganizes leadership for AI-first future







Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is shaking up how the tech giant approaches artificial intelligence with an unconventional leadership strategy: keeping executives out of the room. The CEO has launched a weekly AI accelerator meeting that deliberately excludes senior managers from presenting, instead giving the floor to lower-level technical employees working directly on AI projects.According to internal memos obtained by Business Insider, Nadella created the new meeting format along with a corresponding Teams channel to speed up AI development and gather unfiltered insights from across the company. The approach is intentionally ""messy and chaotic,"" designed to avoid top-down AI leadership and get real-time feedback from engineers in the trenches.The move reflects Nadella's view that AI represents both an existential threat and a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Microsoft. He's pushing the company to operate with unprecedented ""intensity and urgency,"" according to Business Insider sources familiar with the matter.This grassroots meeting structure is part of broader organizational shifts at Microsoft. Nadella recently promoted sales chief Judson Althoff to CEO of commercial business, freeing up his own time to focus on technical AI work. In internal messages to corporate vice presidents, Nadella urged leaders to ""work and act like ICs"" (individual contributors) rather than traditional managers.""We all have to work and act like ICs in our own orgs, constantly learning and unlearning,"" Nadella wrote in a Teams channel for executives, Business Insider reported.The CEO is also having direct conversations with executives about whether they're willing to commit to the ""mountain of work"" required for Microsoft's AI transformation—or leave. ""You've gotta be asking yourself how much longer you want to do this,"" one Microsoft executive told Business Insider.Nadella has shifted his language from saying Microsoft is in the ""early innings"" to the ""middle innings"" of AI, signaling his determination to see the transformation through to completion.","Satya Nadella has launched a weekly AI accelerator meeting that deliberately excludes senior managers from presenting.

The United Arab Emirates is currently in the grip of a notable weather disturbance that is bringing rainfall, strong winds, cooler temperatures and rough seas across much of the country. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has been issuing regular forecasts and alerts as this system moves through, affecting daily life from road conditions to marine safety.Forecasters describe the situation as unstable weather, with convective cloud formations driving intermittent to heavy rain, moderate to strong winds and variable skies, from partly cloudy to overcast. Residents from Fujairah to Abu Dhabi should expect these conditions to persist through at least Friday, with a gradual easing anticipated over the weekend.The ""main rainfall wave"" is expected to reach its height between Thursday, December 18, and Friday, December 19. The NCM reports that the system began in the western regions and is gradually moving eastward.Authorities confirm that this instability is driven by a deep low-pressure system moving from the Red Sea, colliding with a cold air mass in the upper atmosphere.With visibility expected to drop significantly due to blowing dust and heavy rain, Dubai and Abu Dhabi Police have issued urgent safety warnings. Beyond the physical danger of wet roads, motorists face stiff penalties for reckless behavior. Officials have highlighted several ""non-negotiable"" rules to keep the public safe:The unsettled weather coincides with a historic milestone for Dubai International Airport (DXB), which is expecting a record-breaking 8.7 million passengers this month.Travelers are being urged to head to the airport much earlier than usual to avoid road delays on major highways like the E11 and E311. While flight operations are generally resilient, heavy thunderstorms could lead to minor schedule adjustments or gate holds.At sea, the situation is even more precarious. The NCM has issued a ""rough to very rough"" warning for the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman. Winds are expected to gust up to 65 km/h, whipping up sand and causing waves to swell. Marine enthusiasts and boat owners are strictly advised to stay on shore until conditions stabilize.As the rain clouds begin to clear toward the end of the weekend, a noticeable chill will settle over the Emirates. Temperatures are set to drop steadily, with daytime highs falling to 24°C in Dubai and 23°C in Abu Dhabi. The inland city of Al Ain could see the mercury dip as low as 21°C during the day and a crisp 10°C at night.By Saturday evening, the heavy downpours are expected to finally subside, leaving only scattered clouds over northern and eastern areas. Sunday will bring a much quieter end to the week, though rising humidity could still lead to misty mornings in western regions.","The United Arab Emirates is currently in the grip of a notable weather disturbance that is bringing rainfall, strong winds, cooler temperatures and rough seas.

A pleasant and peaceful performance at Hangzhou Safari Park in East China’s Zhejiang Province on Saturday turned terrifying when a black bear suddenly attacked its keeper.Several videos are going viral on social media, showing audience members watching as two keepers guided two black bears onto the stage for another round of performance. One bear successfully performed, while the other, nearing the stage, pounced on its keeper and knocked him to the ground, Global News reported.The fallen keeper struggled to escape while nearby staff grabbed chairs and poles to separate the animal. After the bear was pulled away, it lunged at the keeper again, and staff had to use force to separate them.This footage prompted an online debate over whether animal performances should be banned. Other staff immediately intervened and used props to separate the bear from the keeper. Multiple social media users posted videos of the incident recorded during the bears’ show.The park explained that the incident occurred as the keeper was carrying a large bag of carrots and apples; the bear saw the bag, became excited, and pounced on the keeper in an attempt to get the food, according to the notice. The notice also stated that the keeper said the incident reminded him to be more careful in dealings with the bear in the future.The official social media account of Hangzhou Safari Park posted a notice on Saturday stating that neither the keeper nor the bear was injured.One user, Momo, on the China's social media platform commented, “Safety must be a priority, and we should have respect for animals. Never think of them as cute and docile, or that we can control them.”Another user, Zero Geqian Qianqian, also emphasised the need to focus on safety. Many others have called for the cancellation of animal performances. A user named “Don’t Call Me Ma Ma Ma” asked, “When will animal performances be canceled? Isn’t it in animals’ nature to be food-driven and protective of their food?”Some users expressed sympathy for the bear. A user named “The Girl is Out, I’m at Home” said, “A small bear is like a little baby. How could we make it perform? If it has apples, let it eat! If it were your child, would you make it perform first and then eat? If it’s hungry, then let it perform how to eat, it would be happier, the keeper and the bear would be more harmonious, and the audience would still enjoy it.”On the X also, several users commented on the video. One of the user said, ""I see why the Russians train with them 🤣🤣🤣 that bear is a professional grappler.""Another said, ""Maybe if we didn't lock these animals up for our own amusement they wouldn't attack people.""After the video of the bear attack went viral online and sparked debate, the park released a follow-up video showing that the bear and the keeper have since “reconciled.” While feeding the black bear carrots, the keeper gently petted its head and said, “If you want carrots, why did you snatch mine? [Even if you didn’t], I’ll still give you some.” The black bear stood calmly and ate peacefully, displaying a gentle demeanour.",A black bear suddenly attacked its keeper at Hangzhou Safari Park in East China's Zhejiang Province on Saturday.

Transport alerts in the UAE





When the skies open up and heavy rains sweep across the UAE, the aftermath often leaves motorists facing soggy carpets, stalled engines, or worse. Historically, getting an official police report for these ""natural disasters"" meant towing your vehicle to a police station and waiting for a manual inspection. That has officially changed. Dubai Police have launched a fully automated digital service specifically for vehicle damage caused by weather conditions.Dubai Police have introduced a new online service that allows motorists to obtain a ‘To Whom It May Concern’ certificate for vehicle damage caused by weather conditions, without needing to visit a police station in person. This certificate is often required when motorists file insurance claims for damage inflicted during heavy rain, floods or other natural events.Previously, drivers had to apply online and then take their vehicle to a police station for inspection before receiving the certificate. With this update, vehicle owners can skip the station visit entirely. They simply visit the Dubai Police website, upload photos of the damaged vehicle, apply for the natural disasters certificate, and receive the document electronically within one to two business days for a fee of AED 95.Brigadier Mansour Al Qargaoui, Director of the General Department for Administrative Affairs at Dubai Police, explained that the automated process reflects the authority’s commitment to smarter, faster public services in response to increasing extreme weather events in the UAE.The UAE has recently experienced heavy rainfall, strong winds, thunderstorms and occasional hail, affecting roads and vehicles across several emirates. Dubai Police and other authorities have been issuing weather safety advisories, urging motorists to stay alert, reduce speed, and avoid flood-prone areas as visibility decreases during adverse weather.As part of this context, many drivers have reported rain-related damage to their vehicles, from water leakage and engine issues to electronics malfunctions. With weather impacting travel and property, the automated certificate service comes at a much-needed time to help motorists secure proper documentation for insurance processes without the traditional hassle.The process has been designed to be quick and straightforward for users:Dubai Police also provide support via their hotline at 901 for those who have questions about the service or need assistance during the application process.This digital process reduces time, eliminates the need for police station visits, and allows motorists to move forward with their insurance claims efficiently and safely after extreme weather impacts.Alongside this certification service, Dubai Police have been active in issuing weather safety reminders and advisories as unstable weather continues across the region. Motorists are urged to exercise caution when driving, avoid non-essential travel during storms, and follow instructions from emergency services to ensure personal safety and reduce accident risks on slippery roads.Authorities have also cautioned against visiting beaches or flood-prone valleys during weather disturbances and regularly update residents about expected conditions via alerts to mobile phones and official social media channels.","Dubai Police have introduced a new online service that allows motorists to obtain a ‘To Whom It May Concern’ certificate for vehicle damage caused by weather conditions.

Saudi Arabia ’s new electric transit system

Hajj and Umrah pilgrims in 2026

Smart, cool, and comfortable



Smart Ticketing: No more fumbling for cash. Use your smartphone or on-site vending machines to secure your ride instantly.

Climate-Controlled Sanctuary: Each bus is a high-tech refuge from the heat, equipped with high-efficiency air conditioning, Wi-Fi, and USB charging ports at every seat.

Accessibility for All: A specialized hydraulic system allows the buses to ""kneel"" for level boarding, making the service fully accessible for elderly pilgrims, wheelchair users, and families with strollers.

Real-Time Data: Digital displays at every stop and inside the buses provide live updates on arrival times and destination info in multiple languages.





If you are planning your journey to the Holy City in 2026, your experience on the ground is about to feel significantly smoother, quieter, and more sophisticated. Following its official inauguration in late 2025, the Masar BRT was officially launched as the first fully electric bus rapid transit network in the Middle East.This project isn't just a fleet of new vehicles; it is a total transformation of how millions move through the heart of Makkah, blending deep spiritual tradition with cutting-edge 21st-century sustainability.Saudi Arabia has launched its first fully electric bus network in Mecca, marking a major upgrade to pilgrim transport as the Kingdom prepares for rising Hajj and Umrah numbers in 2026 and beyond. The new system is designed to make movement around the holy city faster, cleaner, and more reliable, especially during peak pilgrimage seasons when crowd pressure is at its highest.The electric bus network has been introduced along the Masar corridor, a key urban route that connects major transport hubs with areas close to the Grand Mosque. Officials say the project reflects Saudi Arabia’s wider push to modernise pilgrimage services while reducing congestion, emissions, and travel stress for millions of visitors.At the heart of the project is a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system powered entirely by electricity, replacing conventional diesel buses on one of Mecca’s most heavily used corridors.The route stretches for around four kilometres, linking the Haramain High-Speed Railway station with central Mecca, bringing pilgrims closer to Masjid Al Haram through a dedicated, high-capacity transport line.The network includes multiple modern stations and stops, allowing pilgrims to board and exit easily without long walks or repeated vehicle changes. Dedicated lanes help buses avoid traffic bottlenecks, a major challenge during Hajj and Umrah seasons, ensuring more predictable travel times for worshippers.For pilgrims planning to visit Mecca in 2026, the new electric bus network promises a noticeably improved experience. Large numbers of Hajj and Umrah visitors traditionally rely on buses to move between hotels, prayer areas, and transport hubs, often facing delays during peak hours.The electric buses are designed to carry high passenger volumes, operate quietly, and offer smoother rides, a significant benefit for elderly pilgrims and families. Authorities expect the system to reduce road congestion, shorten journey times, and make daily movement within Mecca more manageable during the busiest pilgrimage periods.Officials have also highlighted the system’s role in crowd management, helping distribute pilgrim flow more evenly and easing pressure on surrounding road networks.The days of navigating crowded, aging buses are over. The new network, managed by Electromin, utilizes an ""Intelligent Transport System"" (ITS) that provides a passenger experience more akin to a modern metro than a traditional bus:This shift to electric power is a cornerstone of the Saudi Vision 2030 goals to improve the quality of life for residents and visitors. By replacing traditional diesel engines with 420kWh high-capacity batteries, the project will prevent over 31.5 million kilograms of CO2 emissions over its lifespan.The electric bus launch is not a standalone project but part of a broader transformation of Mecca’s transport ecosystem. It complements the Haramain High-Speed Railway, pedestrian improvements, and future public transport expansions aimed at serving millions of annual visitors more efficiently.","Saudi Arabia has launched its first fully electric bus network in Mecca, marking a major upgrade to pilgrim transport.

Advice for daily commuters





As unstable weather conditions continue to sweep across the UAE, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has taken decisive action to ensure public safety.In a recent announcement, the authority confirmed the temporary suspension of several vital intercity bus routes connecting Dubai to the neighboring emirates of Sharjah and Ajman.With heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, and reduced visibility affecting the nation’s highways, here is a comprehensive look at the changes and what you need to know for your daily commute.The suspension primarily targets the busy corridors between Dubai, Sharjah, and Ajman.While internal Dubai buses are still running, albeit with some delays, the following intercity lines are currently on standby:The RTA emphasized that these measures are proactive, designed to prevent commuters from being caught in traffic gridlock or dangerous road conditions as water levels rise in certain areas.The decision comes as the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) issued alerts for thunderstorms, lightning, and even hail in parts of the country.For the RTA, the logic is simple: ""Your safety is our priority.""Heavy rain often leads to water accumulation on major arterial roads, such as Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road and Emirates Road. By suspending these services, the RTA reduces the number of large vehicles on the road, allowing emergency teams better access to manage drainage and clear obstructions.Dubai Police have also echoed this sentiment, urging motorists to avoid unnecessary travel and stay indoors until the peak of the storm passes.Service will only resume once the RTA and police authorities deem the roads completely safe for heavy vehicle transit. There is currently no fixed ""end time"" for the suspension, as it depends entirely on the moving weather patterns.The RTA has issued a formal apology for the inconvenience, thanking the public for their understanding and cooperation. To stay updated in real-time, commuters are advised to:For those who rely on public transport to cross emirate borders, the suspension can be a significant hurdle. However, several alternatives and safety measures are in place:While some delays are possible, the Dubai Metro remains a reliable backbone for travel within the city. Operating hours are often extended during severe weather to help those stranded at the airport or major hubs.Following government advisories, many private and public sector employees are encouraged to work from home. This is the most effective way to avoid the logistical challenges of the current weather. The RTA’s Command and Control Centre is operating 24/7, using a dedicated ""Flood Management Room"" to monitor every corner of the city’s transport network.","Dubai’s RTA has suspended intercity bus services to Sharjah and Ajman due to heavy rain.

Saudi Arabia Earthquake 2025

The epicenter



Impact

No injuries or casualties have been reported.

No structural damage to buildings or infrastructure was observed.

Neighboring countries, including the UAE, were completely unaffected. The NCM specifically noted that the tremor was not felt by residents in the Emirates and posed no threat to the country’s coastal areas.

The bigger picture

The fourth notable tremor

April 2025: A 4.0 magnitude quake struck 55 km east of Jubail.

July 2025: A stronger 5.1 magnitude tremor was recorded near the Farasan Islands in the south.

October 2025: A 4.34 magnitude quake hit the Arabian Gulf, northeast of Khafji.

December 2025: The current 4.3 magnitude event in the Eastern Province.





Residents of Saudi Arabia ’s Eastern Province experienced an unexpected start to their Wednesday morning as a moderate earthquake rippled through the region, briefly unsettling communities while remaining under close monitoring by authorities. The tremor was felt across several areas, prompting residents to share their experiences online, while official monitoring agencies confirmed that no immediate damage or injuries were reported.In the early hours of Wednesday, December 17, 2025, a 4.3-magnitude earthquake shook the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The tremor was recorded at 2:11 am (UAE time) at a depth of about 50 kilometers beneath the surface, according to the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) of the UAE and seismic data from Saudi authorities.Seismologists describe this level of earthquake as moderate, strong enough to be measured clearly by instruments but unlikely to cause significant damage at the surface.The quake’s epicenter was in Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province, a region that sits near the Arabian Gulf. While Saudi Arabia isn’t commonly thought of as a hotbed of seismic activity, the Arabian Plate and adjacent fault systems are geologically active, making smaller tremors a routine scientific observation.Past quakes of similar strengths, including earlier 4.3-magnitude events detected offshore near Jubail, have been tracked by monitoring networks without causing harm.Experts explain that these events often reflect the slow movement of tectonic plates, such as the Arabian Plate pushing against neighboring plates like the Eurasian Plate. This stress occasionally releases as minor tremors across the wider Gulf region.Despite the 4.3 magnitude, which is classified as a ""light"" to ""moderate"" earthquake, authorities have been quick to reassure the public. The Saudi Geological Survey (SGS) and regional weather centers confirmed that:While Saudi Arabia isn’t typically known for frequent major earthquakes, the region does experience occasional seismic activity, particularly along its fault lines in the Red Sea and near the Arabian Gulf.Experts from the Saudi Geological Survey emphasize that the National Seismic Monitoring Network is constantly active, tracking every minor shift in the earth's crust. This network provides real-time data to ensure that any potential threats are identified and communicated to the public instantly.Understanding the science behind small tremors helps communities stay informed without unnecessary alarm.This midnight event marks the fourth notable seismic occurrence within the Kingdom or its immediate coastal waters this year. This series of minor quakes highlights the ongoing tectonic adjustments in the region:Geologists explain that these frequent but minor events are often caused by the Arabian Tectonic Plate slowly colliding with the Eurasian Plate. Rather than a cause for alarm, experts see these as natural ""pressure releases"" that prevent the buildup of much larger, more destructive energy.For those living in the Eastern Province, this event serves as a gentle reminder of nature’s power. Geologists suggest that small tremors like these are often just the earth releasing built-up pressure in a safe, non-destructive way. As of now, the situation is entirely stable, and daily life continues as normal across the Kingdom.","A 4.3-magnitude earthquake shook the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia.

UAE launches its first Licensed Sports Wagering and iGaming Website,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-launches-its-first-licensed-sports-wagering-and-igaming-website/articleshow/125972366.cms,"UAE enters regulated online sports betting market officially / AI Generated Image

for its upcoming integrated resort on Al Marjan Island in Ras Al Khaimah. Vendor licences to international gaming suppliers, allowing them to offer equipment, software and technology to licensed operators in the UAE market.

Supplier licences like the one obtained by Sportradar, a major sports data and betting services provider, further strengthening the ecosystem for regulated online sports wagering and gaming.

How to download Play971?





The United Arab Emirates has taken a major step into the world of regulated online gaming and sports betting with the launch of its first licensed internet gaming and sports wagering website. The platform, called Play971, is officially authorised and regulated by the General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA), the federal body responsible for supervising all commercial gaming activity in the country.Play971 is operated by Coin Technology Projects LLC, a firm incorporated in Abu Dhabi with its main base at Twofour54 Yas Creative Hub, and claims to be fully “located, licensed and regulated in the UAE.” This launch marks a significant milestone for a country that has long been known for strict anti-gambling laws rooted in cultural and religious norms.Play971’s debut represents more than just a new website. It introduces a regulated environment for real-money online games and sports wagering that did not exist before under UAE law. The platform includes a range of casino-style games and sports betting markets, including popular events like football and tennis.Under the supervision of the GCGRA, players and operators must follow strict responsible gaming standards, including systems to verify user identity and ensure that only eligible participants within the UAE can access the service. This controlled launch currently applies in certain emirates such as Abu Dhabi and Ras Al Khaimah, with broader availability expected in early 2026 as the regulatory framework and licensing system evolves.This early rollout serves as a test case for future operators, and regulators continue to refine licensing categories, supplier approvals and compliance rules so that the market expands safely and transparently.The UAE’s move toward regulated online gaming builds on multiple earlier steps. In 2024, the first official lottery licence was awarded to The Game LLC, beginning regulated draw operations with major prizes.According to the General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA), internet gaming is considered a form of “commercial gaming conducted via the internet, using computers, mobile phones, or other digital devices with access to websites or apps that offer games and bets involving chance, skill, or a combination of both.” The regulator notes that these games include bingo, casino games such as slots and poker, eSports, fantasy games, peer-to-peer games, skill-based games, sports betting, and more.On sports wagering specifically, the GCGRA explains that it “involves betting on the outcome of sports events or the performance of athletes or teams,” and that wagers can only be placed legally through licensed operators and sportsbooks.Separately, the GCGRA has also issued:Together, these moves show the UAE modernising its commercial gaming landscape with a regulated, consumer-safe framework rather than a permissive or unregulated market.At launch, Play971 is accessible primarily through its official website, rather than via public app stores. Users can register and play directly online, following identity verification and eligibility checks required by the UAE’s gaming regulator.As of now, no standalone mobile app has been publicly listed on major platforms such as Apple’s App Store or Google Play. This cautious approach aligns with the UAE’s tightly controlled regulatory rollout, ensuring compliance with responsible gaming and digital licensing standards before wider distribution.According to industry observers and regulatory context shared in official announcements, any future mobile app rollout, whether on iOS or Android, would require separate approvals from the General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA), as well as compliance with platform-specific policies.The availability of Play971 is also being introduced in phases, with access currently aligned to emirates and jurisdictions where regulatory readiness has been confirmed, including Abu Dhabi and Ras Al Khaimah. Wider nationwide access is expected to follow only after regulators complete further reviews of system performance, consumer safeguards, and operational compliance.Officials have stressed that users should avoid unlicensed apps or websites claiming to offer UAE-approved betting services, as Play971 remains the only legally licensed online sports wagering and iGaming platform in the country at this stage.With the national lottery, casino-resort projects, vendor license and now Play971, the UAE is slowly but deliberately building a regulated commercial gaming ecosystem that is secure and transparent for consumers and operators alike.","The United Arab Emirates has taken a major step into the world of regulated online gaming and sports betting.

Pilgrim safety during Hajj 2026

What should parents do?





The General Authority for the Care of the Grand Mosque and the Prophet’s Mosque in Saudi Arabia has launched a new child safety initiative at the holy site in Makkah this December. Under this programme, identification bracelets for children are now being issued to families as they enter the Grand Mosque complex. The goal is simple but powerful: ensure young pilgrims are quickly recognised and reunited with their guardians if they become lost or separated in the crowds.This initiative extends earlier versions of child wristband systems that were trialled and operated at key entrances in previous Umrah and Hajj seasons.The child safety bracelets are provided free of charge to families visiting the Grand Mosque with children. There is no online pre-registration required and no payment involved at any stage.Parents or guardians can obtain the bracelets on arrival at the Grand Mosque, where dedicated counters have been set up at key entry gates, including the King Abdulaziz Gate and King Fahd Gate (Gate 79). Trained staff from the mosque authority assist families at these points.The registration process is quick and done on the spot. Guardians are asked to provide basic contact details, such as a mobile phone number, which is then recorded on the bracelet.The bracelet is securely fastened to the child’s wrist before entry, ensuring the child can be easily identified if separated from their family.There is no age restriction specified, but the initiative is primarily aimed at young children, who are more vulnerable in dense crowds during Umrah and Hajj. Authorities strongly advise families with children to collect the bracelet before entering the prayer areas, especially during peak hours.Mosque officials have reiterated that the service is part of broader crowd-management and safety measures, and families are encouraged to use it as a preventive step rather than waiting for an emergency.The initiative is strongly encouraged for all guardians to utilize, especially during peak seasons when visitor numbers surge, such as the Holy Month of Ramadan and the annual Hajj pilgrimage. Authorities note that the system has successfully reduced reports of missing persons during these congested periods.Speaking on the objective of the program, officials have emphasized the importance of the service. Eng. Amjad Al-Hazmi, Deputy Head of the Presidency for Social and Voluntary Services, highlighted the organization’s ""utmost keenness on the provision of the finest and best services for the pilgrims"" and its commitment to ""raise the level of social responsibility."" Similarly, Khalid bin Fahad Al-Shalawi, Undersecretary-General for Social, Voluntary and Humanitarian Services, stated that the initiative ""supports parents and their children to perform their rituals peacefully. ""By providing this safety net, the Authority aims to give parents peace of mind, allowing them to focus fully on their spiritual obligations without the constant worry of losing their child in the crowd.Saudi authorities advise parents not to panic if a child becomes separated inside the Grand Mosque. With the safety bracelet in place, the recovery process is designed to be quick and orderly.If a child goes missing, parents should immediately inform the nearest security officer or mosque staff member and provide a description of the child. Staff are trained to look for the ID bracelet, which allows them to contact guardians directly using the information provided.Lost children are typically taken to designated assistance points inside the mosque complex, where trained personnel care for them until parents arrive. Authorities stress that most separations are resolved within a short time due to the coordinated system in place.This guidance helps parents understand that the bracelet works as part of a larger safety network, not as a standalone measure.Together with these innovations, the child bracelet programme reflects Saudi Arabia’s ongoing commitment to enhancing visitor experience while preserving safety, tradition, and hospitality at one of the world’s most sacred sites.","Saudi authorities advise parents not to panic if a child becomes separated inside the Grand Mosque.

It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

If you have any queries for Dhirendra Kumar you can drop us an email at: toi.business@timesinternet.in

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This is part of an annual cycle during which pensioners must reaffirm their eligibility for pension disbursement. The deadline for submitting the life certificate is November 30.

Biggest Tech Layoffs of 2025: Job Cuts at TCS, Intel, Microsoft, Google and more

Microsoft

Salesforce

IBM





AI-related job cuts crossed 50,000 in 2025 in the US alone, according to new data from consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas (via CNBC). The firm said that companies directly cited artificial intelligence (AI) as the reason for 54,883 job cuts this year – making it one of the biggest drivers of layoffs across the tech industry. The job cuts come at a time when AI is being used as a cost-cutting tool by the companies to deal with inflation, high tariffs, and pressure to improve profitability. A recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) study released in November also suggested that AI can handle 11.7% of U.S. jobs and could save companies $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, healthcare, and professional services.However, some experts question whether AI is the real reason for such widespread layoffs. Fabian Stephany, assistant professor of AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, told CNBC that many companies overhired during the pandemic and may now be using AI as a convenient “excuse” for downsizing.Despite the debate, many companies, including world’s biggest tech companies explicitly named AI as a reason for restructuring this year. Here we look at four big tech companies that called out AI in their job cuts announcementThe e-commerce giant laid off 14,000 corporate employees this year, one of its largest.Announcing the job cuts, Amazon’s senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti said that the company is ‘making organizational changes … which will include reducing in some areas and hiring in others’.“This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,” Galetti explained.Though days later at the company’s earnings call, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy explained “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least. It really — it's culture”.Microsoft conducted at least four major rounds of workforce reduction, cutting around 15,000 jobs this year. Julia Liuson, president of Microsoft's Developer Division, then instructed managers that artificial intelligence usage ""should be part of your holistic reflections on an individual's performance and impact."" In internal emails, Liuson then declared that ""using AI is no longer optional — it's core to every role and every level"".The company also said that it is considering adding formal AI usage metrics to performance reviews as it pushes for greater adoption of its Copilot AI services, adding some teams are exploring including specific AI usage benchmarks in next fiscal year's employee evaluations, according to sources familiar with the plans.In September, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff confirmed that 4,000 customer support roles were cut with the help of AI automation. Benioff then said AI is already doing “up to 50% of the work” at the company and that fewer staff are needed for many support functions. During an appearance on the ""Logan Bartlett"" podcast, he also described it as ""eight of the most exciting months of my career"" explaining how AI technology has transformed the company's operations.""There were more than 100 million leads that we have not called back at Salesforce in the last 26 years because we have not had enough people,"" he explained. ""But we now have an agentic sales that is calling back every person that contacts us.""The company uses an ""omnichannel supervisor"" system that coordinates collaboration between human and AI agents, allowing AI to recognise when tasks require human intervention.In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna revealed that AI chatbots had replaced several hundred HR roles. The company eliminated job roles in marketing and communications and also replaced around 200 human resources positions with AI agents. Krishna said IBM is hiring in areas that require deeper critical thinking such as engineering, sales, and marketing.","AI-related job cuts crossed 50,000 in 2025 in the US alone, according to new data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

Government warns WhatsApp users about ‘GhostPairing’ attack: What is it and how to stay safe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-warns-whatsapp-users-about-ghostpairing-attack-what-is-it-and-how-to-stay-safe/articleshow/126104420.cms,"The WhatsApp Scam That Gives Hackers Your Phone!

What is GhostPairing

How to stay safe





The Indian computer emergency response team (CERT-In) has issued an advisory for WhatsApp users warning them of a ‘device-linking’ feature that can allow attackers to take ‘complete’ control of their account. The advisory, accessed by news agency PTI says that the vulnerability called ‘GhostPairing’ put users’ messages, photos, and videos on the web version at risk. “It has been reported that malicious actors are exploiting WhatsApp's device-linking feature to hijack accounts using pairing codes without authentication requirement,” the cyber agency said in the advisory.“This newly identified cyber campaign called GhostPairing enable cyber criminals to take complete control of WhatsApp accounts without needing password or SIM swaps,” the advisory said.For those unaware, CERT-In is the national technology arm under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (Meity) to combat cyber attacks and guarding of the Indian Internet space.GhostPairing is a type of WhatsApp attack where hackers secretly link their own device to a victim’s WhatsApp account, giving them almost full access without the victim noticing. The attack works by tricking users into entering their phone number on a fake website that looks like Facebook or WhatsApp.According to the advisory, the scam usually starts with a message such as “Hi, check this photo” that appears to come from a trusted contact. The message includes a link with a Facebook-style preview. When users click it, they are taken to a fake Facebook viewer page that asks them to “verify” to see the content. At this stage, attackers exploit WhatsApp’s “link device via phone number” feature by convincing users to enter their number.
