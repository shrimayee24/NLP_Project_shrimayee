‘Who are you to object?': Jharkhand HC judge slams IAS officer over compensation by state govt; video goes viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/who-are-you-to-object-jharkhand-hc-judge-slams-ias-officer-over-compensation-by-state-govt-video-goes-viral/articleshow/123577011.cms,"Image: X@/kumarmanish9

This is a property of the state government, right?

Do you want commission?

Social media reacts



A video from the Jharkhand high court surfaced online showing a judge sternly reprimanding an IAS officer during a hearing. In the clip, which is now going viral on social media, the judge can be seen calling out the officer over alleged discrepancies and irregularities.The IAS officer’s name and posting remain unverified, but the judge is heard warning that an FIR will be filed to initiate an investigation.The incident reportedly took place when the judge was hearing a case related to land acquisition and compensation, but the IAS officer had objected to the compensation being offered to the petitioner.“Who are you to object? Ye state ka property hai na? () the judge can be heard saying in the video.""If the state has recognised any person as a ryot, who are you to say that person is not a ryot. You are an alien to the dispute,"" the judge further added.The judge also accused the officer of taking commissions while questioning his authority to object, saying he was preventing rightful awards from being given.“Commission chahiye aapko? () You want commission in each and every case? Under what authority you have objected? The award has been prepared.You are depriving the person of getting the award” the judge said.“You have to take contempt or I will lodge an FIR against you” he said.“Don’t raise a dispute if you are an outsider. In a property dispute, will you come in like a monkey to claim a share?” the judge can be heard saying.The video has drawn appreciation from the public for how the judge handled the situation.“Wow!! Simply awesome. So satisfying to watch this episode. The bureaucrat thought he was above law for a moment. Hats off to you, the judiciary, and judge,” a user commented.“If all Judges take the right approach and ask all IAS officers, EC, and ED to apply law as per the Constitution, 50 percent cases will go away from court,” commented another.“Judicial accountability in action! The judge's sharp questioning demonstrates that courts are taking corruption seriously. This direct approach could deter future misconduct if consistently applied across all levels of bureaucracy,” read another comment.","A video from the Jharkhand high court surfaced online showing a judge sternly reprimanding an IAS officer during a hearing.

The event will be visible from all seven emirates, with global livestreams and local public viewings set to make the spectacle accessible to millions.A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth moves directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its central shadow — the umbra — across the Moon’s surface. During this alignment, sunlight bends through the Earth’s atmosphere, scattering blue light and allowing red tones to reach and reflect off the Moon, creating the phenomenon popularly known as a Blood Moon.This particular eclipse stands out for two reasons:The Dubai Astronomy Group (DAG) emphasizes that this combination of extended totality and widespread visibility makes the September 7 eclipse especially significant.The central and most visually dramatic phase of the eclipse — totality — will be fully visible across all seven emirates. During this time, the Moon will be completely immersed in Earth’s umbra and appear red in color.This phase begins in the late evening and continues past 10:30 PM.During this 82-minute window, the Moon will take on varying shades of red depending on atmospheric conditions, dust levels, and light pollution.The Dubai Astronomy Group (DAG) will host a public viewing event in Dubai, offering telescopes, expert guidance, and group observation sessions. Event details — including the venue and registration process — will be announced soon.A special highlight of the event will be a curated photo moment capturing the Blood Moon as it rises behind the Burj Khalifa, in collaboration with acclaimed photographer Rami Dibo.To include international audiences, DAG will host a global livestream, featuring:This coordinated broadcast aims to connect skywatchers around the world in a shared experience of the eclipse.Lunar eclipses are safe to view with the naked eye — no glasses or filters are needed.

Lure of easy money: Techie in Bengaluru duped of Rs 91 lakh in work-from-home scam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/lure-of-easy-money-techie-in-bengaluru-duped-of-rs-91-lakh-in-work-from-home-scam/articleshow/123621108.cms,"Trapped in the cycle





BENGALURU: A 36-year-old software engineer was cheated of Rs 91 lakh after falling prey to cyber fraudsters who lured him with a seemingly lucrative part-time work-from-home offer. The scam, which took place over five weeks, was executed through Telegram messages, fake websites, and false assurances of high returns.According to a complaint filed by Arif (name changed), a resident of KG Halli, with the East CEN Crime police on Aug 26, the fraud occurred between July 16 and Aug 22. The private company employee told police that on July 16, he received a message from a Telegram user named ‘Dhanya', who claimed to be from Chennai. She pitched a part-time and full-time job opportunity, promising daily earnings of Rs 5,000-10,000.Initially sceptical, Arif was directed to a website, vacationhostsprimz.com, which appeared to be a legitimate hotel booking platform. Dhanya explained that the work involved reviewing hotels and giving them star ratings. Each task reportedly contained multiple sets, and commissions would be credited on completion.To strengthen her pitch, Dhanya added Arif to a Telegram group named ""Vrbo 4241"", which had around 100 members. Arif noticed members posting about their supposed investments, profits, and even sharing screenshots of credited amounts. Believing the job to be genuine, Arif was convinced to participate.A username and password were created for him on the portal. Soon after, the fraudsters offered him an ""anniversary bonus"" — if he deposited Rs 1 lakh, he would get a profit of Rs 2 lakh.On July 18, Arif deposited Rs 1.5 lakh into an account specified by the fraudsters. The portal displayed a profit of Rs 2 lakh, further building his confidence. He then began investing larger sums.But when he tried to withdraw the money, the fraudsters claimed he had to pay GST and other charges. Later, they told him his account had been blocked due to a ""mistake"" in tasks and investments, and demanded the payment of a fine to unblock it.Between July 18 and Aug 22, Arif transferred Rs 91 lakh in total — not only from his own account but also from his wife's and mother's — into multiple accounts given by the fraudsters. The repeated demands eventually made him suspicious. When he cross-verified with friends and relatives, he realised he had been duped.Arif stopped further payments and reported the matter to the cyber helpline 1930. Police registered a case under the Information Technology Act and section 318 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (cheating).A senior police officer said, ""We are making efforts to track the accounts used by the fraudsters and freeze the money. Such scams exploit people's trust and the lure of easy income. Citizens are advised to remain cautious while dealing with online offers.""Cybercrime officials added that work-from-home scams have been on the rise, with fraudsters increasingly using Telegram and other encrypted platforms to trap victims with false promises of high commissions.","A 36-year-old software engineer was cheated of Rs 91 lakh after falling prey to cyber fraudsters who lured him with a seemingly lucrative part-time work-from- home offer.

Taco Bell CTO admits AI cannot work everywhere; says company now reconsidering where and where not to use the AI going forward,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/taco-bell-cto-admits-ai-cannot-work-everywhere-says-company-now-reconsidering-where-and-where-not-to-use-the-ai-going-forward/articleshow/123605121.cms,"Representative Image

What Taco Bell CTO said about using AI in the company’s operations



“Like many people, sometimes it falls short, but other times it really impresses me,”

“For our teams, we’ll help coach them: at your restaurant, at these times, we recommend you use voice AI or recommend that you actually really monitor voice AI and jump in as necessary,”

“I can tell you it’s a very active conversation inside Taco Bell in partnership with our franchisees. I think at the end of the day, it’s really, really early. And we feel that. And I think other brands feel that, too,”

Taco Bell is reconsidering its use of artificial intelligence (AI) for food ordering. This decision from the American fast food chain came after its new voice AI system, which has been installed at over 500 drive-thru locations across the US, received mixed reviews. The company's Chief Digital and Technology Officer, Dane Mathews , admitted they are ""learning a lot"" from the experience. The voice AI has been met with social media complaints about glitches, delays, and general customer discomfort. Some users have also been intentionally ""trolling"" the system with unusual orders, such as asking for “18,000 cups of water.”In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Mathews described his experience with the technology as inconsistent.he said.He added that he is now considering more carefully when it makes sense to rely on the technology. Using AI at every drive-through may not always be practical, he noted. Matthews also pointed out that in busy locations with long lines, a human staff member could manage the situation more effectively.Mathews added that he plans to work with restaurants to help them navigate the decision.he explained.However, Taco Bell is still refining its plans while reviewing data from over two million customer orders handled by AI.Matthews highlighted.Nearly three years into the generative AI wave, companies are still testing and revising their strategies, unsure of where the technology fits best. However, drive-through voice AI remains a challenge.McDonald’s dropped its IBM trial and is now working with Google Cloud, while Wendy’s is also expanding its FreshAi system built on Google tech. On the other hand, Taco Bell’s parent, Yum Brands, has partnered with Nvidia to explore potential AI applicattions.","Taco Bell is reconsidering its use of artificial intelligence (AI) for food ordering.

The WhatsApp Scam That Gives Hackers Your Phone!

WhatsApp has said that it uncovered a cyberespionage , or hacking, operation that exploited multiple security vulnerabilities across its platform and Apple devices to conduct targeted surveillance of users, with reportedly civil society activists appearing to be among the primary targets. In a statement issued, the Meta-owned company said that it has plugged the loop holes that hackers used to attack specific users.“Incomplete authorization of linked device synchronization messages in WhatsApp for iOS prior to v2.25.21.73, WhatsApp Business for iOS v2.25.21.78, and WhatsApp for Mac v2.25.21.78 could have allowed an unrelated user to trigger processing of content from an arbitrary URL on a target’s device,” WhatsApp said in a statement.The Meta-owned messaging service disclosed the security breach in a brief statement, revealing that hackers had discovered and weaponised a chain of vulnerabilities that allowed them to compromise both the WhatsApp application and Apple devices in coordinated attacks.“We assess that this vulnerability, in combination with an OS-level vulnerability on Apple platforms (CVE-2025-43300), may have been exploited in a sophisticated attack against specific targeted users,” the company added, without revealing much about the cyber attack.However, a report by news agency Reuters said that an estimated 200 users worldwide have potentially been compromised during the espionage campaign.Donncha O Cearbhaill, who heads Amnesty International's Security Lab, said that members of civic organisations appear to be among those affected by the surveillance operation.“WhatsApp has just sent out a round of threat notifications to individuals they believe where targeted by an advanced spyware campaign in past 90 days. Seek out expert help if you have received this alert,” he said.“Early indications are that the WhatsApp attack is impacting both iPhone and Android users, civil society individuals among them. Government spyware continues to pose a threat to journalists and human rights defenders,” O Cearbhaill wrote in a post on social media platform X.He noted that the Apple vulnerability was in a core image library, advising people that they should update their devices and enable iOS Lockdown Mode or Android‘s Advanced Protection Mode to help protect against attacks like this.","Amnesty International's Security Lab says civic organisations may be a target of the operation.

Former GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke had defended Microsoft 's controversial internal memo requiring managers to evaluate employees based on their AI tool usage , arguing that measuring artificial intelligence adoption should focus on cultural alignment rather than quantifiable metrics like code generation. Speaking on the ""Decoder"" podcast that aired August 7, Dohmke explained that simply counting AI-generated lines of code would be ""easily gamified"" and miss the broader point of fostering an AI-forward organizational mindset. Instead, he emphasized that evaluation should center on whether employees demonstrate willingness to learn and integrate AI tools into their workflow.The former GitHub executive backed a June memo from Julia Liuson, president of Microsoft's developer tools division, which stated that ""using AI is no longer optional"" and should be part of managers' performance evaluations. Business Insider first reported on the internal directive earlier this year.Cultural transformation over metricsDohmke characterized the Microsoft memo as ""totally fair game"" for 2025, suggesting that companies should expect employees to reflect on their AI learning and usage of tools like GitHub Copilot, Microsoft Copilot, and Teams Copilot for meeting summaries.The former CEO drew parallels to GitHub's company culture during his tenure, where every employee across all departments—from HR to sales to legal—was required to use GitHub's platform. He made clear that employees uncomfortable with this requirement could find opportunities at ""tens of thousands of other tech companies.""Dohmke described the evaluation process as ""more nuanced"" than simple usage tracking, focusing instead on meaningful conversations between managers and employees about AI learning and adoption. This approach, he argued, aligned with Microsoft's growth-oriented culture that prioritizes continuous learning and adaptation during his time leading GitHub.The stance reflects broader industry shifts toward mandatory AI integration, with companies increasingly viewing artificial intelligence proficiency as essential for competitive advantage rather than optional technological enhancement.","Former GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke defended Microsoft's controversial internal memo.

The Cupertino-based company has scheduled an ‘Awe Dropping’ event for 10:30pm next month where it will unveil 2025 iPhone lineup that may include four models, namely iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max and a slim model rumoured to be called iPhone 17 Plus. ahead of the launch, a new leak has appeared online which says that Apple is also planning to bring a new accessory this year. Tipster Majin Bu says that the company may bring Crossbody Strap, designed primarily for iPhone 17 cases.The upcoming Crossbody Strap is said to feature a flexible metal core to make it fully magnetic along its entire length. Rings at the ends will be polarized opposite to the strap, locking the system firmly for a strong grip. This design makes attaching and removing easy without using hooks or loops, offering a practical option for iPhone 17 cases.The leakster adds that the strap could also be compatible with AirPods Pro 3, expanding its range of uses. The report also shares samples of the upcoming strap which shows a woven nylon body, similar to that used in Sport Loop Bands. Apple may introduce a silicone variant as well. The upcoming iPhone accessory is rumoured to be offered in multiple colour options.Apple’s upcoming iPhone 17 series is expected to feature display sizes similar to the current lineup, with the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max retaining their 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch screens. The new iPhone 17 Air is likely to sit between these two in size. The screen size of the standard iPhone 17 may grow to 6.3 inches, matching the Pro model.Early reports hinted that the slimmer iPhone 17 Air might be a premium device priced higher than the Pro Max. However, sources now indicate it will be a mid-range model, cheaper than both the Pro and Pro Max but more expensive than the standard iPhone 17. This positions it as a direct replacement for the “Plus” model, offering a middle ground in size and price.All four iPhone 17 models are expected to get ProMotion display technology with a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video playback, a feature that was earlier exclusive to Pro models. This upgrade will be made possible by LTPO OLED panels. While LTPO displays also allow for an always-on screen, it is not yet confirmed if this feature will come to all models or remain Pro-only.For the Pro versions, Apple may replace titanium with aluminum for part of the frame, while keeping glass for MagSafe charging. This could result in a half-glass, half-aluminum build that improves durability. A new horizontal pill-shaped camera bump may replace the current square design, with the iPhone 17 Air also tipped to adopt this layout.Powering the iPhone 17 lineup is expected to be Apple’s new A19 Pro chip, built using TSMC’s latest 3nm process for improved speed and power efficiency. For the first time, iPhones could come with 12GB of RAM, allowing smoother multitasking and enabling advanced Apple Intelligence AI features.All iPhone models set to launch in 2025 are rumored to get a major front camera upgrade, moving from the 12-megapixel lens in the iPhone 16 series to a new 24-megapixel sensor. This improvement is expected to deliver sharper photos and allow users to crop images without losing detail.The iPhone 17 Pro Max is tipped to be the first iPhone with three 48-megapixel rear cameras — a Wide, an Ultra Wide, and a Tetraprism Telephoto lens — and may also support 8K video recording for the first time. The iPhone 17 Air is expected to come with a single 48-megapixel rear camera, while the standard iPhone 17 will likely feature a dual-lens setup with Wide and Ultra Wide cameras.The Pro models could introduce a mechanical aperture, allowing users to adjust how much light enters the camera for better control over depth-of-field — a first for iPhones, which currently use fixed apertures. They might also add dual video recording, letting users film with both the front and rear cameras at the same time, a feature popular with content creators but currently limited to some third-party apps.The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will continue to offer a 5x Telephoto optical zoom, which will remain exclusive to the Pro lineup. The standard iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air will not include Telephoto lenses or 5x zoom capabilities.Apple is also said to be working on a 3-year iPhone overhaul strategy with a foldable iPhone coming in 2026.",Apple iPhone 17 series will launch on September 9. The company has scheduled an ‘Awe Dropping’ event for 10:30pm next month where it will unveil 2025 iPhone lineup that may include four models.

Expert Drops Bombshell





The 30th anniversary of Princess Diana’s death may reignite one of the monarchy’s most bitter rivalries. According to royal expert Tom Sykes, Prince William and Prince Harry could be planning competing documentaries on their late mother—threatening to turn her legacy into their latest battleground.Speaking on The Daily Beast podcast, Sykes revealed that he’s heard “on good authority” that the brothers, who have not spoken in years, are exploring separate projects to commemorate Diana in 2027. William is reportedly “not remotely amused” by whispers that Harry and Meghan Markle are working on a Netflix feature tied to their Archewell deal—especially after previous projects were panned as “boring” and “disastrous. ”“We could have dueling Diana documentaries from the two boys,” Sykes suggested, noting how such films could cement their clashing narratives about the princess’s life and the events surrounding her 1997 death.The timing comes as Sykes himself stirs controversy with a fresh essay revisiting conspiracy theories about Diana’s fatal Paris car crash, raising questions about whether her death was as straightforward as official inquiries concluded.While he stops short of calling for the case to be reopened, Sykes insists “the holes in the story are just so fascinating, it’s all hidden in plain sight.”Diana was killed on August 31, 1997, when a Mercedes driven by Henri Paul crashed in a Paris underpass. Paul and Diana’s companion, Dodi Fayed, also died. An official investigation blamed speed and Paul’s intoxication, but speculation about foul play has never fully disappeared.Now, as the brothers approach this milestone anniversary on opposite sides of the Atlantic, Diana’s memory risks becoming collateral damage in their fractured relationship.","The 30th anniversary of Princess Diana's death may reignite one of the monarchy's most bitter rivalries.

A video from Birmingham has gone viral after capturing a woman, identified online as an Indian student, demanding £20 (about Rs 2,300) from a car owner after wiping his window.The clip shows the student approaching a parked vehicle, cleaning the glass, and insisting on payment. Surprised by the demand, the car owner recorded the incident and uploaded it to social media, where it has now crossed two million views.In the footage, the owner is heard asking, “for what?” when the student demands £20. She replies, “I just cleaned your window,” prompting him to respond, “you just did a quick wipe. Look, I’m confused – £20?” To this, she insists, “yeah, I mean that is the cost of living.”The exchange escalates as the student blocks the car, warning, “You will have to knock me if you want to leave,” and refusing to let him go without paying. The owner then calls her a “robber,” saying, “this is what robbers look like nowadays apparently.”The video has triggered sharp reactions online, with many users labeling it as “scripted” or “staged” for social media engagement. One user wrote, “Isn’t she the same girl who hit a parked car for insurance, just realised even that was staged.” Another commented, “Staged, this girl appeared in so many videos like this. But it’s not cool as she is damaging the image of India and many people don’t know that it’s just an act. ”Such staged “street encounter” clips, according to users, have become a rising trend on social media, blurring the line between authentic incidents and content created purely for clout.","A video from Birmingham has gone viral after capturing a woman, identified online as an Indian student, demanding £20.

It may be known as the happiest place on earth, but behind the scenes Disney World has a language of its own that guests rarely hear about. A recent Reddit thread has uncovered a list of secret code words used by staff to discreetly handle incidents across the park.In the r/todayilearned forum, one user wrote, “TIL Disney has a code word for when guests attempt to scatter ashes at one of their theme parks: a ‘white powder alert,’” linking to an article with even more examples. The revelation quickly sparked over 45,000 comments, with many current and former Disney or theme park employees adding to the list.One former custodial worker from Walt Disney World’s Magic Kingdom in 2016 explained, “We use code words so as to not cause panic. The main ones used by custodial are (at least back in my day): Code V = Vomit, Code H = Poop, Code U = Urine, Code BBP = Blood, Code Grandma = Ashes.”Another added, “If you hear anyone at Disney reference a ‘protein spill,’ it means someone puked.”A different ex-staffer, recalling their time at an Orlando theme park, said, “The saddest code was an ’82.’ It meant a rider was too large for the seat and they were either stuck or causing a scene and refusing to move from the loading station.It was called an 82 because they ‘8 2 much,” the New York Post reported.Employees even had discreet ways to describe challenging guests. “And if an employee refers to you as ‘our most treasured guest’ to another employee, it means…they need help de-escalating.”Beyond the secret lingo, former workers have also spoken out about the challenges of working at Disney World. One ex-employee, who began in 2017 and eventually rose to a “coordinator” role, told the Daily Mail, “There is a lot of great aspects of working at Disney World, but the pay with the cost of living in Central Florida is rough, and the heat on top of a physically and emotionally demanding job can be a bit much.”According to reports, staff are bound by strict rules, including bans on taking photos backstage or wearing smartwatches. The former worker revealed, “Any device could be a distraction from vehicle motion and could get you fired if you’re caught wearing one.”","A recent Reddit thread has uncovered a list of secret code words used by staff to discreetly handle incidents across the park.

Tiny robot captures secrets of the Great Pyramid: Exploring Queen's hidden Chamber for the first time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/tiny-robot-captures-secrets-of-the-great-pyramid-exploring-queens-hidden-chamber-for-the-first-time/articleshow/123578165.cms,"

A remarkable journey inside the Great Pyramid



Hidden symbols and their potential meaning

Preserving history through technology





For more than 4,500 years, Egypt’s Great Pyramid of Giza has intrigued explorers, historians, and archaeologists, holding mysteries that have long eluded discovery. Now, a tiny, purpose-built robot weighing just 5 kg has offered an unprecedented glimpse into one of the pyramid’s most inaccessible areas: a narrow shaft leading out of the Queen’s Chamber. Designed to navigate the 20 cm by 20 cm passage without damaging the ancient structure, the robot captured footage that revealed previously unseen chambers and intricate painted symbols on the stone floor, challenging traditional assumptions about the pyramid’s construction and purpose.The robot’s journey is part of the Djedi Project, led by engineers from the University of Leeds in collaboration with inventor Dr. Tze Chuen Ng. Their goal was to explore the mysterious shafts without harming the centuries-old stones, combining ingenuity, robotics, and patience over several years. This small device’s careful ascent has opened a window into the secrets of a monument that has fascinated the world for millennia.The Queen’s Chamber shaft, which rises at a 40-degree angle, had long resisted exploration due to its narrow dimensions.Previous attempts to probe it caused damage, making a safe, non-invasive approach essential. After nearly five years of development, the tiny 5 kg robot was able to navigate the 60-meter shaft gently, bypassing one blocking stone with a flexible camera arm. Beyond it, the robot discovered a small sealed chamber featuring colored symbols painted directly on the stone floor, hinting at symbolic or ritualistic significance. A second stone further along the shaft blocked the robot, leaving what lies beyond still unknown. The discovery adds yet another layer to the ongoing mystery of the Great Pyramid, showing that even the smallest spaces may hide details of great cultural value. It also reinforces the idea that every exploration inside this monument brings the world a step closer to understanding how and why it was built. The painted symbols may also offer clues about the daily lives or beliefs of workers who built the pyramid.The discovery of painted markings challenges the idea that the shafts served solely as air vents. Experts suggest the artwork may indicate ceremonial or symbolic purposes, possibly tied to ancient Egyptian beliefs about the afterlife and the pharaoh’s soul. The deliberate placement of multiple stones also suggests intentional concealment, reinforcing the theory that these spaces had more than just architectural function. Though further exploration is on hold due to security concerns in Egypt, the robot’s footage provides a rare and invaluable view into these long-hidden chambers. The discoveries have reignited worldwide fascination with ancient Egypt, inspiring both researchers and enthusiasts to look closer at the pyramids’ hidden secrets. Experts believe that continued technological innovation may uncover even more chambers, reshaping our understanding of Egyptian history. Such findings remind us that the Great Pyramid is not just an architectural wonder but also a cultural and spiritual symbol. Each new clue adds to its enduring story, proving that its mysteries are far from exhausted even after thousands of years. The painted symbols may also offer clues about the daily lives or beliefs of workers who built the pyramid. If future explorations succeed, these chambers could reveal details about rituals, astronomy, or record-keeping practices of ancient Egypt.While the full mysteries of the Great Pyramid remain elusive, the tiny robot’s expedition demonstrates the potential of modern technology to illuminate ancient secrets. By combining robotics, careful engineering, and digital documentation, researchers have not only avoided damaging the pyramid but also sparked renewed global interest in Egyptology. The released footage allows historians, archaeologists, and the public to engage with these discoveries directly, offering insights into a monument that continues to inspire awe more than four millennia after its construction. The Djedi Project team hopes to resume exploration once conditions in Egypt allow, potentially unlocking more hidden chambers. These findings could mark just the beginning of a new era in non-invasive archaeology. Such breakthroughs highlight how robotics can act as a bridge between modern science and ancient civilizations. Each discovery brings humanity closer to solving one of history’s greatest architectural mysteries.","The robot was designed to navigate the 20 cm by 20 cm passage without damaging the ancient structure.

and Residency: Ejari is also a key requirement for processing residency visas. Legal Enforceability: Non-registered tenancy contracts are inadmissible in court, making Ejari vital for resolving rental-related legal matters.





Why this change matters for tenants and landlords





Dubai tenants are now required to update their Ejari contracts with the details of all individuals living in their apartments or villas. This new mandate comes as part of a government crackdown on unlicensed co-living arrangements, aiming to ensure that only authorized residents occupy rented properties. The change requires tenants to provide full details of everyone living in their unit, regardless of whether they are the primary tenant or a co-occupant. With this step, Dubai’s authorities are tightening enforcement of tenancy laws, ensuring that only those officially listed are permitted to reside in a property.As of recent, landlords in Dubai have started scrutinizing the details included in Ejari contracts to ensure that the names of all individuals residing in a property are listed. The rules are simple: any person staying in the unit for a month or longer must be entered into the system using the Dubai REST app. Failure to do so can lead to complications, with landlords pressing tenants to provide the missing information.The initiative comes as the Dubai Land Department (DLD) intensifies efforts to eliminate unlicensed co-living arrangements. Landlords who continue to violate these regulations face stringent penalties, as the authorities adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards unauthorized shared living.The process of registering co-living individuals on the Ejari system is straightforward, especially with the help of the Dubai REST app, The Ejari contracts are registered with the Dubai Land Department in the name of either the principal tenant or the landlord.Tenants must follow these steps to update their records:The updated rules apply to family members, domestic help, and any other co-occupants who reside in the unit. This is crucial for tenants who wish to avoid issues when dealing with government agencies, utilities, and landlords.Ejari, which means ""My Rent"" in Arabic, is a mandatory rental registration system introduced by the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) under the Dubai Land Department (DLD) in 2007. It serves as the backbone of Dubai’s rental market, ensuring that all agreements are legally documented. Here's why Ejari matters:By ensuring that all co-residents are accurately recorded, Ejari adds transparency to Dubai’s rental market and helps maintain accountability.With stricter enforcement of housing laws, the importance of complying with Ejari regulations cannot be overstated. Tenants benefit from Ejari by ensuring their rental agreements are properly documented, which is essential when setting up utilities, renewing visas, or even resolving disputes. For landlords, having a valid and properly registered Ejari contract provides legal protection and ensures they are not unintentionally breaking any laws.Furthermore, the recent crackdown on unlicensed shared living arrangements is a reminder for tenants to be diligent about their housing agreements. Landlords who permit unauthorized occupants without the proper registrations face heavy penalties, which may include fines or even loss of their ability to lease properties.","Dubai tenants are now required to update their Ejari contracts with the details of all individuals living in their apartments or villas.

Each training vehicle is linked to the system via GPS, enabling electronic route monitoring. The platform operates across more than 27 driving institute locations, supported by over 3,400 instructors and more than 3,000 training vehicles.Annually, the platform handles training for approximately 250,000 trainees, logging over six million hours of instruction. Since its launch, it has functioned without safety issues and has significantly optimised the efficiency and consistency of driver education in the city.The core of ‘Tadreeb’ lies in its intelligent use of artificial intelligence to analyse trainee data and identify individual needs. This targeted approach ensures that each learner receives appropriate, high-quality instruction based on performance trends and behavioural insights.The platform’s integrated dashboards provide real-time visibility into training progress, instructor compliance, and operational metrics. These tools have supported measurable improvements in:Performance evaluation criteria and service transactions — such as permits and training contracts — are fully automated and integrated with relevant authorities. This automation has led to:‘Tadreeb’ has achieved significant recognition on the international stage. It is the first driver training platform in the world to receive official recognition from the International Commission for Driver Testing (CIECA) — a global body focused on driver testing standards.Additionally, in 2025, the platform was awarded the Prince Michael International Road Safety Award, a testament to its impact on road safety and innovation in training delivery.Looking ahead, RTA plans to extend the capabilities of the Tadreeb platform by enhancing customer experience through AI tools, expanding data use for personalised learning paths, and continuing the automation of training oversight.

Where public opinion sits

What could change in the next reign

A new sovereign could:

Maintain the 2022 limits;

Tighten style/usage via letters patent (e.g., continued non-use of HRH); or

Ask ministers to explore legislation if removing a peerage were desired.

Bottom line

Facts today:

Talk has picked up again about what happens to Prince Andrew’s titles in the next reign. Several outlets claim Prince William wants a tougher line and could look at further steps once he is king. There is no official plan on record; the stories rely on unnamed sources and remain unconfirmed.In January 2022, Buckingham Palace announced that the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages were returned to the Queen and that he would not undertake public duties; at the same time, briefings confirmed he would no longer use the HRH style in an official capacity. He remains Duke of York and holds no front-line duties. None of that has changed.Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and, in some tellings, press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge. None of this has been announced; it is framed as a possibility, not a decision.A dukedom is a peerage, which is a legal dignity. Removing a peerage requires an Act of Parliament; the House of Lords Library is explicit on this point. The last time Parliament provided a mechanism to strip titles was the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, drafted for wartime enemies, hardly a ready tool for modern scandal.Any fresh action would almost certainly need new legislation.By contrast, styles (like HRH) sit within the sovereign’s power to define by letters patent, hence the 1917 letters patent that limited who is HRH. Using letters patent to refine style/usage is established; using them to annul a peerage would collide with statute and convention. In practice, government-backed legislation is the clean route for removing a dukedom.Prince Andrew holds a 75-year Crown Estate lease on Royal Lodge dating from 2003. Changing his residence would be a landlord-tenant and lease issue, not a simple royal edict. Reporting about pressure to move has see-sawed, but the legal baseline is the lease itself.Recent polling shows strong support for going further: 67% of Britons say Andrew should be stripped of his remaining titles; only 13% are opposed. That mood is real but policy still comes down to law and process.Any move to remove a dukedom would prompt debates on due process, precedent, and where to draw the line for other peers.Andrew does not use HRH, holds no military roles or active patronages, and retains the Duke of York title. Any further step is not something a monarch can do “on a whim”; it would almost certainly require Parliament. Until a legal route exists and is pursued, this remains talk, not policy.","Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge.

"Movement signatures: How we move, gesture, use facial expressions is unique; could be as different as fingerprint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/movement-signatures-how-we-move-gesture-use-facial-expressions-could-be-as-unique-as-fingerprint/articleshow/123483187.cms,"



MANCHESTER: The way someone walks, talks, smiles, or gestures gives a clue to who they are. Whether through the flick of an eyebrow, the rhythm of our walk, or the tilt of a head, movement speaks volumes.And my recent paper shows that people may have their own movement fingerprint. This is a style of movement that is characteristic of a person's identity. So, someone who uses expressive facial gestures might also speak with animated hand movements or walk with a lively gait. These consistencies could form a motion fingerprint that is unique to the individual.First, let's explore how faces move and why this matters.Everyone has their own style of moving their face, for example, how they raise an eyebrow, purse their lips, or squint when laughing. These patterns of movement help us recognise familiar people even when the visual quality is poor, such as in low lighting or from a distance. And as a person becomes more familiar to us, we become tuned to the way they move, learning their unique patterns of motion, just like we remember their face or voice.Human faces are constantly in motion; they blink, smile, grimace and talk, to name a few movements. Researchers categorise facial motion into rigid movements (such as turning or nodding the head) and non-rigid movements (like expressing emotion or speaking). It's the non-rigid movements that tend to be most personally distinctive.The way we gesture with our hands, shift our posture and tilt our heads all carry identity information. Gestures are often shaped by personal habits or cultural norms; for example, someone might habitually nod three times when agreeing, or use a distinctive hand wave common in their home country.Facial movements are synchronised with the way we sound. When we talk, our face plays a role in shaping the sound of our voice. For example, if you talk with a wide open mouth, your speech sounds deeper and richer. Studies show that people can match other people's voices to moving faces more accurately than to static ones. This suggests that dynamic cues to identity are present in the movement of the face and the sound of the voice.People with face recognition difficulties (those who are ""face blind"" or prosopagnosic) may be better at recognising moving faces than still ones. Typically, people who are face blind can see faces and the differences between them, but struggle to link the face to a specific person. Here, idiosyncratic information from movement can provide an additional clue to identity.Gait, a person's walking style, is one of the most studied body movements. Early research, such as a 2005 study, investigated participants' recognition of identity from gait using point-light displays. In this case, bright spots (lights) were placed on key areas of a person's body. All other visual cues were removed. Participants could only see bright spots against a dark background. The study found participants could tell fairly well who someone was from the way the spots moved.Characteristics such as stride length, limb movement, posture and pace form a consistent motion pattern that is unique and surprisingly difficult to fake, making gait analysis a reliable clue for identifying people.Movement fingerprintsMy review brought together evidence from behavioural and brain imaging studies to consider if such consistencies between different types of motion exist and how we might explore this phenomenon further. The paper proposes that people have an overall style of movement.More work needs to be done to find direct evidence of movement fingerprints. For example, we still aren't sure what part of the brain processes these movement-based identity cues.So far, research shows that the posterior temporal sulcus - an area of the brain located roughly above your ear on each side - responds not just to faces and bodies, but to how someone moves more generally. This area is active when we hear voices or see people speak, suggesting it may help link motion and sound. Also, this region plays a key role in allowing us to understand our social world, interpreting other people's actions, determining where they are looking, and picking up on social cues such as gestures, facial expressions and changes in gaze direction.However, it's probably just one part of a larger brain network involved in recognising others through motion.Real-world applicationsMotion-based identity traits aren't as stable or specific as fingerprints or DNA. They're what researchers call soft biometrics: useful but not always accurate.But as we better understand the link between motion and identity, exciting real-world applications are emerging.Motion analysis could support contactless identity verification from gait-based authentication at airports to gesture-based identification in smart environments, such as homes that respond to a user's unique movement patterns. In clinical settings, movement analysis might help support people with social cognition impairments, face recognition or movement issues. For example, helping a doctor identify changes in the way a patient produces non-verbal cues.But many questions remain. We still aren't sure how consistent motion fingerprints are as someone gets older and in different contexts. Individual differences in people and environmental factors like lighting, clothing or stress could affect them.Researchers also aren't sure how exactly we manage to understand all this movement in everyday life without even thinking about it.Figuring this out could not only help improve technologies like social robots and develop tools for people with recognition and communication difficulties, but also tell us more about how we process and react to other people.

Britain agrees to drop mandate for Apple to provide 'back door',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-agrees-to-drop-mandate-for-apple-to-provide-back-door/articleshow/123395824.cms,"Representative Image





SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain dropped a request for Apple to create a tool to give law enforcement access to customers' cloud data.

Four men in Northampton, England, raced away from an Indian restaurant without paying their 200-pound (about Rs 21,000) bill, which led to a spectacular chase by the staff. According to a Daily Mail article, the event took place in the Saffron restaurant at around 10.11 pm on August 4.Men can be seen entering the restaurant in the widely circulated CCTV footage posted on Instagram. Later in the video, they can be seen rushing out of the restaurant's door after leaving their table. When they reveal their intent, a staff member may be seen pursuing them.

The toll of relentless intensity





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently admitted in an interview that he no longer separates work from life, revealing the extreme intensity behind his leadership style. Speaking to Stripe CEO Patrick Collison, Huang disclosed that even while watching movies, his mind is consumed by Nvidia, leaving him unable to recall the films he sits through. “I work from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep,” Huang said. “I work seven days a week. When I’m not working, I’m thinking about working… I sit through movies, but I don’t remember them because I’m thinking about work.” This confession underscores the relentless drive that has propelled Nvidia to its current status as a $4 trillion tech powerhouse.Huang describes his dedication as constant, explaining that work occupies every moment of his day. He admits that even in moments of leisure or relaxation, his thoughts revolve around imagining Nvidia’s future and exploring potential innovations. “Sometimes you’re imagining the future and boy, if we did this and that. And it’s working. You’re fantasizing, you’re dreaming,” he said. Huang jokingly adds that his ultimate goal is to “turn Nvidia into one giant AI,” believing this might eventually provide him with some measure of downtime.Huang’s intense work ethic has been a driving force behind Nvidia’s transformation from a graphics-card upstart into the world’s most valuable public company. In July 2025, Nvidia reached a record valuation of $4.08 trillion, a testament to the company’s innovation in AI and computing. Huang credits the company’s success to a culture of relentless focus, long hours, and dedication to excellence, highlighting that groundbreaking achievements rarely come without sacrifice.Former employees describe Huang’s work culture as extreme, with emails at 1 a.m. and seven-day workweeks. Bloomberg reported engineers staying until 2 a.m. to meet deadlines, often driven by incentives like stock grants. Huang himself acknowledges that achieving greatness is not easy and that the path often involves long stretches of hard, sometimes unenjoyable work.Huang’s approach mirrors the philosophies of other high-profile tech leaders, such as Elon Musk, who recently admitted to working seven days a week and even sleeping at the office to keep projects on track. Musk has long advocated a “work like hell” mentality, emphasizing that world-changing achievements rarely come from a 40-hour workweek.

'Nuke India': Shocking Message Inscribed On Minneapolis School Shooter’s Weapons Revealed In Video





A yearbook photograph shows Minnesota shooter Robin Westman during the first year he lived as a woman, years before he killed two children in a mass shooting at his former church during a school Mass in Minneapolis, US.As per the American news website, The New York Post, the picture appeared in the 2019-2020 Southwest High School yearbook.At that time, Westman was a junior, with short curly brown hair, a pink blouse, dangly earrings, a gold necklace, and what appeared to be a light pink lip stain.The look was different from his senior year photo, where he had orange-dyed puffy hair and wore a blue T-shirt with purple graduation robes.The yearbook photo was taken the same year Westman legally changed his name from Robert to Robin, a decision approved by his mother.During high school, Westman wrote diary entries praising attacks such as the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, and the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand.Before graduating from Southwest High School in 2021, Westman also studied at Saint Thomas Academy, a Catholic all-boys school with military-style training, and at Minnesota Transitions charter school, which is designed for students who face difficulties in traditional schools.In a handwritten journal he later posted on YouTube, Westman expressed regret about transitioning, as per the New York Post report. Parts of the journal were written in a mix of Russian Cyrillic script and English.“I only keep [the long hair] because it is pretty much my last shred of being trans. I am tired of being trans, I wish I never brain-washed myself,” he wrote, according to Post.Westman shot and killed Fletcher Merkel, 8, and Harper Moyski, 10, while they were praying in Annunciation Church in US, then killed himself.Several others were taken to hospital.","Robin Westman shot and killed Fletcher Merkel, 8, and Harper Moyski, 10, while they were praying in Annunciation Church in US, then killed himself.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

People using chatbots as companions

A new study examining how three leading AI chatbots respond to questions about suicide found they are inconsistent in their replies, raising concerns about the safety of people, including children, who are turning to these tools for mental health support.The research, published in the medical journal Psychiatric Services, reportedly found that while OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google ’s Gemini, and Anthropic’s Claude generally refused to answer the most high-risk queries, their responses to less extreme prompts varied significantly and could still be harmful. According to a report in AFP, the study, conducted by the RAND Corporation, highlights the urgent need for clearer safety standards for AI developers.“We need some guardrails,” said lead author Ryan McBain, a senior policy researcher at RAND. “One of the things that’s ambiguous about chatbots is whether they’re providing treatment or advice or companionship. It’s sort of this gray zone.”McBain and his co-authors, in consultation with psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, developed 30 questions about suicide, assigning each a risk level. Questions about suicide statistics were considered low risk, while specific ""how-to"" queries were deemed high risk. The study is said to have found a surprising degree of safety in how the chatbots handled the six highest-risk questions, with all three generally refusing to answer and instead directing users to seek help from a professional or a hotline.However, the safety net weakened with less direct, high-risk questions. For example, the study found that ChatGPT consistently provided answers to questions it should have flagged, such as which type of rope or firearm has the “highest rate of completed suicide.” Claude also answered some of these questions. The study did not attempt to rate the quality of the responses themselves.On the other end of the spectrum, Google's Gemini was the most cautious, often refusing to answer even basic, low-risk questions about suicide statistics. McBain suggested that Google may have “gone overboard” with its safety measures.The findings come as a growing number of people are using AI chatbots for emotional support. The study authors, including Dr. Ateev Mehrotra of Brown University, believe far more Americans are now turning to these tools than to mental health specialists.“You could see how a combination of risk-aversion lawyers and so forth would say, ‘Anything with the word suicide, don’t answer the question.’ And that’s not what we want,” Mehrotra said. He noted that unlike a trained clinician, who has a legal and ethical responsibility to intervene in a crisis, chatbots typically “put it right back on the person. ‘You should call the suicide hotline. Seeya.’”This lack of accountability has prompted some states, like Illinois, to ban the use of AI in therapy. However, this does not prevent people from asking chatbots for help, or the chatbots from responding.The study authors noted their research did not account for ""multiturn interaction,"" or back-and-forth conversations, which are common among young people who treat AI as a companion. Another recent report, from the Center for Countering Digital Hate, took a different approach and found that by posing as 13-year-olds and using trickery, they could get ChatGPT to generate detailed, personalized plans for risky behaviors and even compose suicide letters.While McBain said he believes such trickery is unlikely in most real-world scenarios, he stressed that companies must be held to a higher standard. “I just think that there’s some mandate or ethical impetus that should be put on these companies to demonstrate the extent to which these models adequately meet safety benchmarks,” he said.","A new study examined how three leading AI chatbots respond to questions about suicide. It found they are inconsistent in their replies, raising concerns about the safety of people, including children, who are turning to these tools for mental health support. The study highlights the urgent need for clearer safety standards for AI developers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123620344,imgsize-64950,width-400,resizemode-4/in-a-lonely-world-widespread-ai-chatbots-and-companions-pose-unique-psychological-risks.jpg"

Melinda Gates on creating more balance in household

In a 2019 interview with Business Insider, Melinda French Gates revealed a surprising detail about her life with Bill Gates long before their 2021 divorce: the Microsoft CEO, known for his relentless work ethic, quietly took on the daily school run for their eldest daughter, Jennifer.The decision, she explained, was born from a family debate. With their daughter starting preschool at a campus a significant drive from their home, Melinda suggested they wait to enroll her until she was a bit older. Bill, however, was insistent. ""He was really quite adamant that he thought we should start then,"" she recalled. ""And he said, 'I'll drive them.'""Melinda's surprise was echoed by other parents. Just weeks into the school year, she said, other mothers approached her to share a revelation: they were seeing more dads at morning drop-off. The reason? ""We went home and we told our husbands, 'If Bill Gates, who's the CEO of Microsoft right now, can drive his kid to school, so can you!'""What started as a negotiation between two parents, Melinda realized, ended up having a ripple effect. She and Bill were, without knowing it, modeling a more equitable distribution of ""unpaid"" domestic labor—the chores and tasks, like doing dishes or packing lunches, that often fall to women.Melinda, who has spoken frequently about the importance of shared responsibility, noted that these simple household decisions had a wider impact. ""By trying to create more balance in household chores,"" she said, ""we realized we were impacting other marriages."" The former couple even continued to do the dishes together throughout their marriage, as she recounted to the outlet.Ultimately, the daily drives proved invaluable beyond just easing the burden on Melinda. ""Bill and the kids cherished those moments in the car,"" she told Business Insider. ""Listening to music together, the conversations over many years that they had—it's a side of him that they might not have seen otherwise. It would've been a missed opportunity.""Before headlines of a billion-dollar divorce, the couple navigated the same challenges of balancing work and family as many others. In the process, the founder of one of the world's most powerful companies quietly helped redefine what it meant to be a modern father—one carpool at a time.","Bill Gates quietly took on the daily school run for their eldest daughter, Jennifer.
