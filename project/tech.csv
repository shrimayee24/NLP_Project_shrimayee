The offensive posts from the verified account of the popular red puppet included hateful targeting of jews and other minorities. The screenshots of the disturbing posts quickly circulated online before being deleted.As reported by Reuters, after the hack the posts which appeared on Elmo’s X account included slurs against Jews, insults directed at US President Donald Trump, and references to conspiracy theories involving Jeffrey Epstein.

Meta follows YouTube in cracking down on ‘unoriginal’ Facebook content,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/meta-follows-youtube-in-cracking-down-on-unoriginal-facebook-content/articleshow/122482040.cms,"Meta announces new rules to crackdown ‘unoriginal’ Facebook content



Meta explains what’s unoriginal content



Meta also laid down some practices which will help the creators in maximising the output of their content



After YouTube , now Meta has announced its plans to crack down on ‘unoriginal’ content across its social media platform Facebook. The company has detailed the new measures on the Facebook Creators blog. With this move Meta aims to combat low-quality, repurposed, or plagiarized material that are circulating on the platform. “We’re making progress ‑ in the first half of 2025, we took action on around 500,000 accounts engaged in spammy behavior or fake engagement, applying measures ranging from demoting their comments and reducing the distribution of their content to preventing these accounts from monetizing. We also took down around 10 million profiles impersonating large content producers,” said the company.The company claims that under the new rules, the creators who engage in lazy reposting — uploading content without commentary, transformation, or credit—will face temporary loss of monetization and reduced reach across all posts. Along with this, Meta is also testing a feature which that adds a link to the original creator on duplicate videos, helping viewers find the source and ensuring proper attribution.Meta also revealed that the reaction videos, trend participation, and transformative edits are still welcome. And the crackdown majorly focuses on accounts that impersonate the original creators and exploit the viral content for engagement and don’t value add anything.Meta explains that Unoriginal content reuses or repurposes another creator's content repeatedly without crediting them, taking advantage of their creativity and hard work.“We love it when creators reshare content, add commentary in a reaction video or join in on a trend, adding their unique take. What we want to combat is the repeated reposting of content from other creators without permission or meaningful enhancements”, said the company.To ensure your content is set up for success on Facebook, please follow these best practices:* Post original content. Pages and profiles receive the greatest distribution when they consist primarily of original content that you filmed or created.* Make meaningful enhancements. You can use content you're approved to use from other sources, as long as you make it your own through creative editing, voiceover or commentary.* Tell a story. Authentic storytelling resonates with viewers and is more likely to perform well.* Avoid watermarks. Avoid using visible third party watermarks and content that is visibly recycled from other apps or sources.* Use high-quality captions. Keep your captions and hashtags relevant to the content."," Meta has announced its plans to crack down on ‘unoriginal’ content across its social media platform Facebook.

The Film: A Quieter, Hopeful Superman



FAQs

Q1. Why did Dubai light up the Burj Khalifa for Superman?

Q2. Can I still see the Superman display?

Q3. What’s special about this Superman movie?





Dubai doesn’t do things halfway, especially when it comes to global pop culture moments. This weekend, to mark the release of James Gunn’s new Superman, the city turned the Burj Khalifa into a superhero beacon.The LED façade lit up with scenes from the movie, including a close-up of David Corenswet as Clark Kent and Superman, with the words “Dubai, look up” flashing across the skyline. It wasn’t subtle, and that was the point. It was bold, clear, and unmistakably Dubai.The promotion, organized by Reel Cinemas, drew crowds downtown and plenty of praise online. One user called it “the best promotion for a movie ever.” Whether or not you agree, it’s hard to argue with the scale.But the Burj Khalifa wasn’t the only place Superman touched down.At the Dubai Mall waterfall, shoppers got a surprise. Nestled among the silver diving statues, a Superman figure made a low-key appearance. The mall leaned into the moment, sharing on Instagram:“Superman just flew into Dubai Mall.”It was small, but effective and added just enough wonder to make people stop and look twice.Meanwhile, over at Ski Dubai, things got cooler.A digital display showed Superman and Krypto soaring above the snowy indoor slopes. The promo invited families to book advance tickets at VOX Cinemas. There was even a screening that allowed pets to join their humans in the theatre. For a film that features Superman’s loyal dog, Krypto, the gesture made sense and it definitely made social media.James Gunn’s take on Superman isn’t just another reboot. It’s a reset. Starring David Corenswet as a more grounded, thoughtful Clark Kent, the movie leans into emotional beats rather than just big action.Critics have responded well. The film holds an 83% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with reviewers calling it a “fresh start” and praising its emotional depth. It’s not trying to be the biggest superhero movie ever, it’s trying to bring heart back to the franchise.And it seems to be working. Globally, the movie opened to $217 million in its first weekend, including strong numbers in the UAE and across the region.It was part of a local promotional campaign tied to the film’s global release. Dubai often uses the Burj Khalifa for major entertainment launches, from Marvel movies to concerts.The Burj Khalifa show was a timed activation. However, events at Dubai Mall and Ski Dubai may continue through July, depending on footfall and cinema schedules.Directed by James Gunn, this version focuses more on Clark Kent’s humanity and less on destruction and spectacle. It’s being positioned as the starting point for a new, connected DC universe.","Dubai celebrated the new Superman film by lighting up Burj Khalifa with clips from the movie.

Q: Can I re-enter Saudi with a new visa during the 30-day period?





In late June 2025, Saudi Arabia’s General Directorate of Passports (Jawazat) unveiled a groundbreaking policy, visit visa holders whose visas expire can now request a 30-day exit permit via the Absher platform and its Tawasul service. After paying any outstanding fines, this grant allows legal departure without punishment.Previously, overstayers faced immediate fines or arrest. This policy signals a new approach: balancing enforcement with flexibility for those delayed by travel issues, health concerns, or emergencies .Exiting under the grace period is crucial. Overstaying beyond 30 days results in harsh penalties:Although intended for Hajj and Umrah peak periods, these rules now apply tovisit visa holder, year-round.Eligible individuals include holders of expired tourist, business, or family visit visas and Umrah visas—applicable once per person.Note the exceptions:The grace policy is part of an ongoing effort to digitize Saudi's immigration infrastructure:Saudi Arabia’s shift reflects a larger move under Vision 2030, using technology to streamline operations, reduce paperwork, and clamp down on irregular visa cases. Modernisation goals include:For expats and sponsors, this means compliance is real-time and transparent.Now excuses like “I did not know” won’t hold water once Absher sends the alert.The exit window policy is not an isolated change. Saudi recently introduced skill-based visas, which:Together, these reforms present a Saudi Arabia in transition, moving from rigid control toward flexible, skill-based mobility.Failure to comply will restore older penalties; fines, bans, and possible jail time.Saudi Arabia’s new 30-day exit grace period, integrated with digital systems, marks a fresh and fairer approach to immigration. Pairing this with skill-based visa reforms signals readiness to shift from arbitrary control to a more transparent, performance-driven, and global profile. Still, this grace is not a loophole, time matters, and overstays bring serious consequences. As Saudi modernizes, staying informed and compliant will be vital for every visitor.Saudi Arabia is making visa compliance automatic and shared not only for visitors but also for those who manage their immigration status. By combining in Absher with stiff penalties, the government is sending a message. Sponsors and expats now share responsibility, and mistakes can be costly.Only if your visit visa was still valid. Overstaying beyond expiry even within 90 days of entry relies on the 30-day exit application.You may face fines up to SAR 50,000, jail up to six months, deportation, and likely a multi-year re-entry ban.Only once per applicant, tied to their expired visa.No. This window is strictly for exit only.","Saudi Arabia introduced a 30-day grace period effective June 26 for expired visit visas. Failure to leave within this window still triggers severe consequences: fines up to SAR 50,000, imprisonment up to 6 months, deportation, and multi-year bans. Travellers and expats must stay informed via official platforms like Absher and Jawazat to stay compliant.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122435549,imgsize-206427,width-400,resizemode-4/122435549.jpg"

Q1. How can I tell if a Wi-Fi network is a honeypot?

Q2. Is using a VPN enough to stay safe on public Wi-Fi?

Q3. What should I do if I suspect I’ve connected to a fake Wi-Fi hotspot?





When you travel abroad, connecting to free Wi-Fi in airports, hotels, or cafés seems harmless. It’s fast, easy, and usually part of the plan. But that free internet can come with hidden dangers you might not expect. Many UAE residents don’t realize that cybercriminals can use these networks against them.Hackers create fake Wi-Fi networks that look legitimate. These traps are called honeypots. They trick users into connecting so hackers can steal sensitive data like passwords, emails, or even banking details. Unlike a visible virus or attack, this kind of threat is silent. You might never know you’ve been targeted.Even real public Wi-Fi isn’t always safe. Many lack strong security, making it easier for hackers to eavesdrop or push malware to your device. The UAE Cyber Security Council warns travelers to be cautious and protect their digital lives.A honeypot is a fake Wi-Fi network set up by hackers. It looks like a normal public network, think “Airport_Free_WiFi” or “Hotel_Guest.” But when you connect, your data can be intercepted. Hackers can watch your online activity, steal passwords, or even access your private messages.These fake hotspots are dangerous because they don’t require passwords or verification. They are designed to be attractive so you’ll join quickly, without thinking twice.This is one of the most common ways hackers steal your data on public Wi-Fi. Imagine you’re talking to a friend, but someone else secretly listens in and can even change the conversation. That’s a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack.When you use public Wi-Fi, hackers can insert themselves between your device and the website you’re visiting. They can capture your login info, credit card numbers, or private messages. And since it happens quietly, you usually won’t notice until it’s too late.Public Wi-Fi networks, even real ones, usually don’t use strong encryption. Encryption is like a lock for your data. Without it, anyone nearby can listen to your internet traffic. Hackers can inject malware or redirect you to fake websites designed to steal your information.Also, many public networks require you to agree to terms and conditions before connecting. These agreements sometimes give the network permission to track your location, monitor your browsing habits, or collect personal data. Most people click “” without reading, unknowingly giving up privacy.Here are simple steps to protect your data when using public Wi-Fi abroad:It’s hard to tell just by the name. If the network name looks generic or suspicious, or if it doesn’t require a password, be cautious. Ask staff to confirm the official network.A VPN greatly improves your security by encrypting your data. But you should still avoid risky activities like banking or sharing sensitive info on public networks.Disconnect immediately. Change your passwords, especially for important accounts.

Banning or licensing? Dubai’s E-scooter safety needs smarter regulation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/banning-or-licensing-dubais-e-scooter-safety-needs-smarter-regulation/articleshow/122429418.cms,"E-scooter riders in Dubai face new rules as calls grow for safety over bans/ Representative Image

TL;DR

13 people died in e-scooter and e-bike incidents in Dubai in early 2025, triggering bans in some areas.

E-scooters offer vital transport options for residents who don’t drive, especially in large communities.

Instead of banning, a mix of education, licensing, and clear rules could make streets safer for everyone.

Education & Licensing or Banning?



Safety risks: Riders often ignore traffic rules.

Pedestrian danger: Scooters zip through crowded sidewalks.

No system to hold reckless riders accountable.

The argument for licensing and education

Not everyone can afford a car or taxi.

E-scooters are practical for short trips in large communities.

More Balanced Solutions: What Could Work Instead of a Ban?

Mandatory Licensing or Permit System: Riders must pass a short safety course and get a digital permit. This filters out riders who don’t understand road rules.

E-Scooters Back on Dubai Metro, But With Rules

No riding in stations, footbridges, or on platforms.

Must be folded at all times and powered off.

Cannot block doors, aisles, or seats.

No wet, dirty, or damaged scooters.

No charging at stations.

Batteries must meet international safety standards (like UL, IEC).

The Debate Over Freedom and Safety: What’s the Real Solution?

FAQs

Q1. Are e-scooters banned everywhere in Dubai now?

Q2. Can I take my e-scooter on the Metro?

Q3. Do I need a license to ride an e-scooter in Dubai?





Dubai is seeing a sharp rise in e-scooter and e-bike accidents. In just the first five months of 2025, 13 people lost their lives in micromobility-related incidents. That’s already more than the 10 deaths recorded in all of 2024. In response, some neighbourhoods, including Victory Heights and Jumeirah Beach Residence have banned e-scooters completely.But for many residents, especially those without cars, e-scooters are more than a trend. They're a necessity. In communities like Green Community DIP-1, riding one can cut a 20-minute walk down to 3 minutes, a big deal in Dubai's summer heat.The current approach feels all-or-nothing. Either full freedom or total bans. But the issue might not be the vehicles themselves, it’s the lack of consistent rules, awareness, and enforcement.So the real question is: do we need more bans, or just better systems?Right now, anyone aged 16 or above can ride an e-scooter in Dubai. Helmets are mandatory, but you’ll often see people riding without them. There’s no requirement for training, testing, or understanding the rules of the road.The argument for banningThe problem is often poor behavior not the scooters themselves.A structured training or licensing system could help filter out unsafe riders, much like we do with cars. Without that, people will continue riding without the knowledge to do it safely.Instead of banning scooters outright, here’s what a more measured approach could look like:In October 2025, the RTA lifted its ban on e-scooters aboard public transport, allowing foldable models on the Metro and Tram under strict safety conditions.This move shows that the city isn’t anti-scooter, it just wants clear safety measures in place.This issue comes down to balance. On one side: people’s right to use simple, affordable transport. On the other: the public’s right to feel safe in shared spaces.Banning all scooters because of a few bad riders may be a quick fix, but it’s not a long-term answer. The better path might be tougher to build, it requires laws, education, awareness, and real enforcement but it’s fairer. And it actually solves the root of the problem.No. Only some residential areas have banned them. You can still ride in approved zones and public roads where allowed by the RTA.Yes, but only if it’s foldable and you follow all RTA rules (like keeping it off, clean, and not blocking doors).As of now, no license is required. But there are growing calls for a formal training or permit system to improve safety.","13 people died in e-scooter and e-bike incidents in Dubai in early 2025, triggering bans in some areas.

Israel’s new national communications satellite, Dror-1, was successfully launched into space early Sunday morning from Elon Musk ’s SpaceX launch facility in Florida.The Dror-1 satellite, developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), weighs 4.5 tons, spans 17.8 meters, and is equipped with the largest transmission and reception antennas ever built in Israel, according to Israel National News.It is the first in a new line of satellites that will replace the older Amos series, and is designed to fully meet Israel’s communication needs for the next 15 years.According to IAI, Dror-1 is among the most advanced communication satellites in the world, built almost entirely with Israeli-made technologies. It includes a digital communication payload and “smartphone in space” features that allow for agile and adaptable communication throughout its operational life, as per Sat News.The satellite was carried into orbit on SpaceX Falcon 9 two-stage rocket. The booster, making its 13th flight, successfully returned to Earth, landing on a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean, avoiding a sonic boom over Florida.The second stage continued to push the satellite into a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), a path that will allow Dror-1 to reach a fixed position relative to Earth.SpaceX referred to the launch as “Commercial GTO 1,” a naming convention it has not previously used.This mission marks SpaceX’s 519th launch overall, and its 85th of 2025.In the coming days, Dror-1 will open its solar panels and antennas and begin maneuvering into its final geostationary orbit, a process expected to take about two weeks.IAI described the mission as a milestone for Israel’s space capabilities, demonstrating its ability to develop and deploy cutting-edge satellite technology using mostly local resources.","Israel's new national communications satellite, Dror-1, was successfully launched into space early Sunday morning from Elon Musk ’s SpaceX launch facility in Florida.

TL;DR

You need written permission from your landlord before you sublet.

You also need to register the sublease with Ejari, or it’s not legal.

1. Check Your Lease First

2. Get Written Approval

The name of the person moving in How long they’ll stay Whether they’re renting a room or the whole unit

3. Register the Sublease with Ejari

Without an Ejari, your subtenant won’t be able to set up DEWA (utilities), internet, or even get a parking permit. More importantly, an unregistered sublease is considered illegal, no matter what your landlord says

Sharing your apartment might seem like a smart way to earn some extra money. Rents in Dubai aren’t cheap, and many tenants are looking for ways to split costs or make side income. But renting out part of your flat, even just a room, comes with legal risks.Dubai tenancy law is clear: you can’t sublet unless your landlord agrees in writing. And even with permission, you need to go through the proper steps to make it official. Skip them, and you could end up in real trouble.Here’s what you need to know before you start.The starting point is your rental contract. Some leases clearly say that subletting is not allowed. Others don’t mention it at all. Either way, you need to get the landlord’s approval before subletting, even if it’s just one room or a short stay.Allowing someone to live in your flat in exchange for rent, without written permission, is a breach of Dubai’s tenancy rules.A casual text from your landlord isn’t enough. You’ll need a signed letter or agreement that shows they’re okay with the sublease. This protects you in case anything goes wrong.What to include:If the landlord says no, that’s the end of it. You can’t sublet legally without their okay.Once you have permission, your next step is Ejari. This is the official rental registration system in Dubai. You or your subtenant will need to register the sublease to make it legal.Why it matters:You can register at any typing center or through the Dubai REST app.If you keep the DEWA account in your name but someone else is living there, make sure you have a clear deal about who pays what. Misunderstandings over bills are common.And if you register the sublease properly, your subtenant can open their own utility account. That way, things stay clean.When you sublet, you don’t stop being the tenant. You’re still on the hook for rent, damages, and contract terms. If your subtenant breaks something or stops paying, it’s your problem.Also, many buildings have rules against short-term stays or sharing. Check with your building management before you go ahead.Subletting can help cover your costs, but it’s not as simple as handing someone a key. Without your landlord’s written consent and a registered Ejari, you’re putting your lease and your deposit at risk.Take the time to do it right. If the landlord says no, respect that. If they agree, make sure everything’s on paper and registered. That’s the only way to protect yourself.Only if your building allows short-term rentals and you register with Dubai Tourism. Most tenants aren’t allowed to do this under standard contracts.Same rules apply. If money is changing hands, it counts as subletting. You still need permission and a registered Ejari for that person.Probably. DEWA records, building access logs, and Ejari mismatches make it easy to spot. If they find out, they can start eviction proceedings.Only if your landlord agrees. Charging extra without permission could be seen as profiteering, which is not allowed.","Dubai tenancy law is clear: you can’t sublet unless your landlord agrees in writing.

Q3. When and where does WOOHOO open?





Artificial intelligence is becoming part of many areas in the Arab world. It’s in education, banking, and even helping people manage money. Now, AI is stepping into a new place: the kitchen.Dubai is set to open a restaurant called WOOHOO, where the kitchen is guided by an AI chef. It’s the first in the world to do this. The restaurant will be near the Burj Khalifa, one of the most famous landmarks.Here’s the catch: humans still cook the food. But everything else, from what’s on the menu to the music and even the way servers act, will be created by Chef Aiman, an AI developed by UMAI.Chef Aiman is not your usual kitchen helper. It’s an AI designed to work alongside human chefs. Its job is to help come up with recipes, suggest ingredients, and make sure dishes are balanced and precise.The name Aiman comes from “AI” and “man,” hinting at a blend of technology and human creativity. The AI has been trained on thousands of recipes from all over the world. It also knows a lot about food science and how ingredients work together on a molecular level.Instead of guessing, Chef Aiman breaks down food into smaller parts like texture, acidity, and umami, the savory flavor we all know.It then mixes and matches these to find new and interesting flavor combinations.Unlike a real chef, Chef Aiman can’t taste or smell the food it makes. It doesn’t have senses like humans do. But it has something else: a huge database of food science and recipes.Because of this, it can spot combinations people might miss. For example, it looks for ways to reuse food that usually gets thrown away, like meat scraps or fat, to reduce waste. This makes the kitchen more sustainable.This focus on using all parts of ingredients is rare in restaurants. It’s a smart way to cut down on food waste while creating new dishes.Chef Aiman isn’t just a tool that sends over recipes. It’s interactive. Human chefs can actually talk to it, ask questions, and get real-time feedback.One chef described it like a conversation. In a video, a chef was seen saying, “I was talking to AI-man,” as he scribbled notes while the AI guided him through steps and ingredients. This back-and-forth is a big part of how it works. The AI helps chefs build menus, tweak dishes, and plan the entire cooking process.WOOHOO calls itself “dining in the future.” It plans to open its doors in September 2025 in central Dubai, close to the Burj Khalifa.The menu will feature international dishes with a touch of Asian flavors. But the real story is how it blends AI’s precise insights with human creativity. Dishes will change with the seasons, cultural influences, and even moods, something Chef Aiman can adjust for by analyzing data.The restaurant’s design and service will also reflect AI input, creating a dining experience unlike any other.Chef Aiman isn’t just a silent helper in the kitchen. It’s becoming a voice in the food world. It appears on podcasts, talking about how AI can understand taste, the ethics of cooking, and what the future of food might look like.Most AI in restaurants works behind the scenes, handling orders or customer questions. Chef Aiman is different. It’s front and center, creating and guiding what people eat.With its ability to learn from global data, Chef Aiman can adjust dishes based on what’s fresh, what’s culturally relevant, and even how people feel. This is a new way AI and cooking come together.No. Humans still prepare and cook all the meals. Chef Aiman helps design the recipes and guides the kitchen staff.No. It doesn’t have senses. It works by analyzing data about ingredients and flavors.It will open in September 2025, in the center of Dubai, near the Burj Khalifa.","Dubai is set to open a restaurant called WOOHOO, where the kitchen is guided by an AI chef.

Running a restaurant in UAE? Here are the rules you can’t ignore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/running-a-restaurant-in-uae-here-are-the-rules-you-cant-ignore/articleshow/122388992.cms,"Arabic menus and cultural compliance are a must for restaurants in the UAE /Representative Image

TL;DR:

Arabic menus and signage aren’t optional. It’s a legal and cultural requirement.

Alcohol, pork, and shisha each come with their own set of strict handling rules.

UAE law also controls your closing time, packaging, and even your music volume.

Menus Must Include Arabic

Serving Alcohol? Follow These Steps



You’ll need more than a license. You’ll need systems. Alcohol can only be sold or served with the right permit. Dishes prepared with alcohol must be stored, cooked, and served separately. The use of different utensils and prep stations is a must. Menus must clearly state “contains alcohol” in both Arabic and English.

Restrictions on Pork Products?

Only licensed venues (usually hotels) can serve it. Pork must be stored and prepared in fully separate areas. Use different cooking tools, no overlap. Label it clearly on the menu, with no room for confusion.

Offering Shisha? You’ll Need a Permit



A separate license is required. It can only be served in designated outdoor or ventilated areas. You can’t serve shisha near schools or mosques. Daily cleaning and equipment checks are mandatory and may be inspected.

Your Restaurant Hours and Behavior Matter Too

Most places close by midnight, unless you have permission to stay open later. During Ramadan, food and drink can’t be served publicly in the daytime. Some places can apply for screened dining areas for non-Muslims. Loud music near prayer times or religious areas isn’t allowed. Staff dress code and conduct must be modest and respectful, especially front-of-house staff.

No More Single-Use Plastics

Plastic cutlery, plates, straws, stirrers Plastic bags and food containers

Why Following the Rules Is Good Business

FAQs

Q1. Do I need Arabic menus even if I serve tourists?

Q2. Can I cook with alcohol without labeling it?

Q3. Is pork allowed in all restaurants?





Owning a restaurant in UAE takes more than serving good food. There’s no shortage of food businesses in the UAE. But running one here isn’t just about serving good meals. It's about knowing where you are and following the rules that come with it.You’ll be dealing with local laws, cultural expectations, and regulatory bodies that don’t leave much room for guesswork. Some rules are clear. Others catch new owners off guard.Here’s what every restaurant owner should know, before facing fines or trouble.Arabic is a core part of doing business in the UAE. Arabic must be included on all menus, even if your primary language is English. If your menu doesn’t include Arabic, you’re breaking the law. This applies across printed menus, screens, delivery platforms, anywhere a customer sees food options.Authorities have fined restaurants before for ignoring this. And lately, there’s growing public demand to see more Arabic used, not less. It’s not just about compliance. It’s about respect.Restaurants that skip Arabic send the wrong message. People notice.If there is a buffet, those dishes should be kept apart and clearly labeled.Alcohol bottles used in cooking must be clearly marked and kept in a separate storage area. Even accidental cross-use can lead to penalties.Pork is allowed but only under strict control:Don’t assume you can just add pork to the menu because your kitchen is clean.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

The new iOS app called Sun Day helps users track their UV exposure and estimate vitamin D levels based on location, skin type, and how much clothing they're wearing.The app works by using your phone's location to pull up the local UV index, then lets you manually toggle when you're stepping in and out of sunlight. Tell it your skin type from six options, mention whether you're rocking shorts and a t-shirt or bundled up, and Sun Day calculates how much vitamin D you're getting and how long you can stay outside before risking a burn.This follows last weekend's release of Bitchat, Dorsey's encrypted peer-to-peer messaging app that works over Bluetooth without needing internet. Both apps are part of what he calls his ""learning"" process through weekend coding projects, and he's building them using an open-source AI coding tool called Goose , which is developed by Dorsey’s Block .The app keeps things simple. You tap a button when you go outside, tap it again when you head back in, and it gives you a rough estimate of your vitamin D gains for that session and the whole day. It also shows useful info like sunrise and sunset times, cloud cover, and your personal burn limit based on the UV index.Sun Day is currently available through Apple's TestFlight beta program, with the full source code posted on GitHub for anyone who wants to dig in. There's no word yet on when it might hit the regular App Store or if an Android version is planned.

YouTube new monetisation rules: Why the 2025 policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety, accountability, and protecting minors from online harassment, inappropriate content, live chat abuse, privacy violations, and potential exploitation during livestreams.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue. Simple re-uploads or minimal edits will not qualify.","On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.

Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI has reportedly implemented a controversial policy which requires all its employees to install a ‘spyware software’ on their laptops issued by the company. This move of the company which aims to enhance the security has started discussions about the privacy of the employees. As reported by Business Insider, the staff at xAI involved in the training of Grok has been asked to install a monitoring tool called Hubstaff, which will keep a track of the websites visited, apps used, mouse movements and more.According to a report by Business Insider, Elon Musk’s AI startup has asked the employees training Grok to download and install a workforce management system called Hubstaff. This monitoring toll is designed to keep track of employee activity including keystrokes, screen activity, and application usage.The company has not yet revealed the exact reason behind this new policy, but it is speculated to be a response to the highly competitive and sensitive nature of AI development, where intellectual property and data security are paramount.Initially, the directive applied to all employees, regardless of whether they had company-issued laptops, with a July 11 deadline for compliance. Later the company asked the employees using their personal devices to either purchase a new device using the xAI $50 per month tech stipend or create different profiles to separate their work from personal browsing.The company’s HR team said that the new software would help the company in streamlining the work process and will also offer better insights into daily tutoring activities. “This new tool serves to streamline work processes, provide clearer insights into daily tutoring activities, and ensure resources align with Human Data priorities,"" the company's human resources team said in a mass email to employees.However, the employees feel that the new monitoring tool is “surveillance disguised as productivity”.The report further adds that apart from Hubstaff, xAI also uses HR manager Rippling to clock the hours of workers. Along with this, the company’s in-house system Starfleet tracks the amount of time the tutors spent on each task.Meanwhile, it has been a tough time for xAI. The Elon Musk-owned company apologised “for the horrific behaviour that many experienced” for 16 hours, starting on July 8. Through the official Grok account on X (formerly Twitter), the AI company said that “the update was to provide helpful and truthful responses to users” but it spit out responses which “contained extremist views.”xAI has also provided an explanation on what went wrong. It said that the incident stemmed from a July code update that activated deprecated instructions, causing Grok to reflect extremist views from X posts for 16 hours, a vulnerability not anticipated despite pre-release testing, as revealed by xAI's investigation.","Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI has reportedly implemented a controversial policy which requires all its employees to install a ‘spyware software’ on their laptops. This move of the company which aims to enhance the security has started discussions about the privacy of the employees. The company has not yet revealed the exact reason behind this new policy, but it is speculated to be a response to the highly competitive and sensitive nature of AI.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122442925,imgsize-13890,width-400,resizemode-4/SpaceX-makes-rare-2-billion-investment-in-Elon-Musks-AI-startup-xAI.jpg"

Jensen Huang questions MIT study

How Nvidia CEO uses AI himself, and why he says it makes him smarter

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed recent MIT research suggesting artificial intelligence diminishes cognitive abilities, arguing instead that his daily AI use has actually enhanced his thinking skills. Speaking on CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" that aired Sunday, Huang said he uses AI ""literally every single day"" and believes his "" cognitive skills are actually advancing.""""I haven't looked at their research yet, but I have to admit, I'm using AI literally every single day,"" Huang stated during the interview. ""I think my cognitive skills are actually advancing, and the reason for that is because I am not asking it to do the thinking for me.""The MIT Media Lab study, which analyzed 54 subjects writing SAT essays using ChatGPT, Google Search, or no tools, found that ChatGPT users showed the lowest brain engagement and ""consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels."" Researchers used EEG technology to monitor brain activity across 32 regions during the writing process.Huang challenged the study's methodology, questioning how participants were using AI tools . ""I'm not exactly sure what people are using it for that would cause you to now not have to think,"" he said on the CNN program. ""But if you have the thing in order, for example, the idea of prompting an AI, the idea of asking questions... you're spending most of your time today asking me questions in order to ask good questions. It's a highly cognitive skill.""Nvidia CEO emphasized that AI should be used as a learning tool rather than a replacement for thinking. ""I'm asking it to teach me many things that I don't know or help me solve problems otherwise I wouldn't be able to solve reasonably or research,"" Huang explained during the Sunday interview.Huang further that effective AI interaction requires sophisticated cognitive skills, particularly in formulating quality questions. ""As a CEO, I spend most of my time asking questions, and 90% of my instructions are actually, you know, conflated with questions,"" Huang explained. ""When I'm interacting with AI, it's a questioning system. You're asking a question, so I think that in order to formulate good questions, you have to be thinking, have to be analytical, reasoning yourself.""Huang described his approach of using multiple AI systems to cross-reference and critique responses. ""I wouldn't just receive it. Usually, what I do is say, 'Are you sure this is the best answer you can provide?' Take the answer from one AI, give it to another AI, ask them to critique itself,"" he said during the CNN interview. ""There's no different than getting three doctors' opinions.""This methodology, according to Huang, actually strengthens analytical abilities rather than weakening them. ""So I think that process of critiquing and critiquing the answers of your critical thinking enhances cognitive skills,"" he concluded on ""Fareed Zakaria GPS,"" offering direct advice to the MIT study participants: ""Apply critical thinking.""","MIT study found ChatGPT users showed lowest brain engagement and ""consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels"" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says he uses AI ""literally every single day"" and believes his "" cognitive skills are actually advancing"" He argues formulating quality questions for AI requires analytical and reasoning skills.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122438099,imgsize-57344,width-400,resizemode-4/122438099.jpg"

How the technology works

Can the visually impaired also enjoy the fun and thrill of a Formula E race? Yes, it’s now possible — thanks to a new initiative by Formula E and Google Cloud: an AI-powered audio race report. This initiative promotes inclusivity and makes motorsport more accessible for blind and visually impaired fans. Google Cloud will work with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) to conduct focus groups and user testing during upcoming race weekends in Berlin and London, with a full rollout planned for Formula E season 12.The project was unveiled by Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds at the Google Cloud Summit in London. It uses Google Cloud’s generative AI technology to create rich, descriptive audio summaries of every E-Prix race. These reports will offer fans a dynamic recap that captures the excitement and key moments of each race, available on demand shortly after the chequered flag.The initiative originated from a Google Cloud Hackathon held during the 2024 London E-Prix. It is being developed in close partnership with RNIB to ensure the final product meets the needs of visually impaired users.Sharing his enthusiasm about the collaboration, Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds said, “At Formula E, we believe the thrill of electric racing should be accessible to everyone. This innovative collaboration with Google Cloud is a fantastic example of how technology can be used for good—creating a brand-new way for blind and visually impaired fans to experience the drama and emotion of our sport. By working closely with the RNIB, we are ensuring this innovation is truly inclusive and fit for purpose, so that no fan is left behind. ”John Abel, Managing Director of Specialised Software at Google Cloud, added, “For too long, the visual nature of racing has been a barrier for fans who are blind or visually impaired. Google Cloud's AI technology will act as a digital storyteller, creating a vivid audio narrative that brings the speed, strategy, and excitement of Formula E to life. We are proud to work alongside a partner like Formula E that shares our passion for using innovation to break down barriers and connect people through shared experiences. ”Sonali Rai, RNIB’s Media, Culture and Immersive Technology Lead, also said, “Audio description transforms how blind and partially sighted motorsport fans can fully engage in enjoying the full racing spectacle—taking in the visceral sounds of cars on the track while feeling the passion of the crowd.”She continued, “RNIB has been working with Formula E and Google Cloud on this AI-powered podcast, which promises to give a full picture of the race in an accessible and engaging way for blind and partially sighted fans. Formula E’s commitment to working directly with the community to develop this technology is exactly the right approach. It sets a fantastic standard in inclusivity for other sports to follow and stay on track with new advances in innovation. ”The audio report is generated through a multi-stage process powered by Google Cloud's AI platform, Vertex AI. Google’s Chirp model accurately transcribes live race commentary. Google’s Gemini models analyze the transcribed commentary along with live timing data and other official race information. The AI identifies key events such as overtakes, incidents, and strategic pit stops and generates an engaging, fact-based race summary.Also Read: Berlin E-Prix: From Oliver Rowland’s World Championship win to Felipe Drugovich’s debut, there’s a lot to look forward to The text is then converted into natural, expressive speech using advanced text-to-speech technology, resulting in a polished audio report ready for distribution.
