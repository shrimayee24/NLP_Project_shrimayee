New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Prabhakar Raghavan

will transition to the role of Chief Technologist

Google has appointed Nick Fox, a seasoned leader within the company's search and ads division

Here's the memo Google CEO Sundar Pichai sent to Google employees:

Hi Googlers,

It's been an exciting few days for AI across our products. We saw NotebookLM with Audio Overviews go viral, added more ways to find information in Search and Lens, and launched a revamped Google Shopping for the AI era. We also just shared a big milestone in our work to help doctors use AI to detect diabetic retinopathy: 600,000 screenings and counting, and we’re expanding access to more people across India and Thailand. There’s a lot more to come.

AI moves faster than any technology before it. To keep increasing the pace of progress, we've been making shifts to simplify our structures along the way, including the creation of Google DeepMind and the joining of the Platforms & Devices teams. As a next step, Prabhakar and I have been thinking through how to structure our Knowledge & Information team for the Gemini era, and today we shared the following changes:

The Gemini app team led by Sissie will join Google DeepMind under Demis. As the name suggests, the Gemini app is the direct consumer interface to the latest and greatest Gemini models. Bringing the teams closer together will improve feedback loops, enable fast deployment of our new models in the Gemini app, make our post-training work proceed more efficiently and build on our great product momentum.

The Assistant teams focused on devices and home experiences will move to Platforms & Devices so they can sit closer to the product surfaces they’re building for and bring our AI-powered home initiatives into one team and focus on improving user experience.

In parallel to this, Prabhakar has decided it’s time to make a big leap in his own career. After 12 years leading teams across Google, he’ll return to his computer science roots and take on the role of Chief Technologist, Google. In this role, he’ll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence. Nick Fox, a longtime Googler and member of Prabhakar’s leadership team, will be stepping up to lead K&I, which includes our Search, Ads, Geo, and Commerce products.

Prabhakar's leadership journey at Google has been remarkable, spanning Research, Workspace, Ads, and K&I. He led the

team in launching Smart Reply and Smart Compose as early examples of using AI to improve products, and took Gmail and Drive past 1 billion users. Across K&I, Prabhakar and team have achieved significant growth and innovation: from launching AI Overviews, a groundbreaking advancement in Search that benefits hundreds of millions of users worldwide to introducing new search modalities like Circle to Search, video understanding, and ""shop what you see"" in Lens — all while improving core Search functionality. Maps and Shopping have transformed with AI-driven features like immersive view and virtual try-on. And in Ads, we’ve made real progress with AI-powered ad formats and streamlined campaign management, while continuing to innovate with Performance Max to empower millions of businesses.

I’m so grateful to Prabhakar for the strong foundation and leadership bench he’s built across K&I. That includes his incredible senior leaders and Nick who is ready to hit the ground running in his new role as SVP of K&I!

Over the past few years, Nick has been instrumental in shaping Google's AI product roadmap and collaborating closely with Prabhakar and his leadership team on K&I's strategy. And throughout his career, Nick has demonstrated leadership across nearly every facet of K&I, from Product and Design in Search and Assistant, to our Shopping, Travel, and Payments products. He was also a pioneering leader in Ads, where he helped establish a rigorous quality and user-focused approach that remains key to our success. Nick has launched innovative consumer products like Google Fi and spearheaded complex initiatives such as RCS messaging. I frequently turn to Nick to tackle our most challenging product questions and he consistently delivers progress with tenacity, speed, and optimism.

Congratulations to Nick, and a heartfelt thank you to Prabhakar for his leadership through numerous technology shifts and for building a strong foundation for the future.

- Sundar","Google has appointed Nick Fox, a seasoned leader within the company's search and ads division. The Gemini app team led by Sissie will join Google DeepMind under Demis.

What is significance of this Apple-Google partnership

The US Department of Justice is ""very likely"" to prohibit Google 's long-standing search deal with Apple , according to Jefferies analysts. This decision could mark an end to the 22-year-long partnership, which has been in place since 2002 and is still continuing.The $25 billion agreement, which makes Google the default search engine on iPhones , is estimated to account for 20% of Apple's pretax profit and 6.3% of its total revenue.Jefferies analysts predict the ban could result in an 8% to 11% decline in Apple's share prices.At the centre of the largest antitrust trial in decades, Google's practice of paying billions annually to secure prominent placement on devices has come under scrutiny. The DOJ argues that these deals stifle competition and innovation, while Google maintains that its dominance stems from consumer preference.Despite the potential setback, the full impact may not be immediate. Jefferies estimates a final court outcome could take three to eight years, including appeals. This timeline could allow Apple to develop alternative strategies, such as exploring its own search engine or deepening AI integrations.The case's outcome could have far-reaching implications for the tech industry. It may force Apple to reconsider its search strategy and potentially open doors for competitors like Microsoft . The decision could also fundamentally alter Google's ability to maintain its search engine market dominance through financial agreements.",Jefferies analysts predict the ban could result in an 8% to 11% decline in Apple's share prices.

The Watson Issue and the Cost in Dollar Denomination

Watson's Poor Performance on Field

Rumor Mills for an Alternate SnapShot

Critical Choice Ahead for the Browns



Cleveland Browns have seen the first half of their regular season; but, so far, they seem on the brink of disaster in search of a lifeline for salvation for the entire season. Insult to injury but also cost: $230 million tied into the franchise.The question the Browns have to ask themselves is if they will make a decisive move or let hopes to make the playoffs slip into their fingers.Not to mention how dire the situation is with the fact that Deshaun Watson just signed a mammoth 2022 contract. Former NFL player Chris Canty has called for a draconian approach: ""They need to cut Deshaun Watson after this season and absorb a $100 million hit on next year's cap. Take the pain now rather than dragging it out for three or four years.Not holding Watson, though, doesn't exactly give the Browns any respite; after dumping Watson, it would already leave them with a $72.9 million hit once the season ends after 2025.Watson hasn't exactly been thrilling anyone this season. In his six games so far, he has only been able to garner 1,050 passing yards, five touchdowns, and three interceptions, never ever getting over 200 yards passing in one game. As Canty noted, the Browns would almost have to go the same way the Denver Broncos went with Russell Wilson-but on an even more intense level.Also Read - How NFL Players Invest Speculations about Watson's future almost came ahead of discussing who could replace him, most especially by Colorado Shedeur Sanders. He has just been phenomenal throughout the season so far, having thrown 72.6% complete passes for 2,018 yards and 17 touchdowns in six games. To count among his awesome skills, NFL Scout Dame Parson singles out his very natural passing skills on a quick release with accuracy - one thing of dire need to the Browns.Currently ranked 28th in the NFL in quarterback rankings, Watson has the worst QBR in the league at 21.7. The Browns are at a crossroads: do they get out of Watson's deal by taking a historic cap hit , or do they press through with Watson and wait for him to find some semblance of his former self while bringing joy back to their fans? Those answers may find themselves in Week 7 as the season wears on.Also Read - Record Breaking Viewership of NFL","Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson is tied to a $230 million contract through 2022.

Can the Rodgers-Adams reunion revitalize the Jets' season?



Aaron Rodgers & Davante Adams Talk Reunion After Trade To The Jets | Pat McAfee Show

Could Adams be the answer for Rodgers amid Williams' struggles?



In the wake of a tough Week 6 loss to the Buffalo Bills , New York Jets QB Aaron Rodgers finds a silver lining with the return of former teammate Davante Adams . This reunion not only lifts team morale but also raises hopes for a turnaround in the Jets' struggling 2-4 season. The question on everyone's mind: can Adams rekindle the spark that once made them an unstoppable duo?Also Read: “[Jerry Jones] Was Out of Line”: Cowboys owner’s Radio outburst sheds light on NFL Media’s dark side, says Mike Florio After a disappointing loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 6, New York Jets QB Aaron Rodgers has reason to celebrate: his former teammate, Davante Adams, is back in the locker room.Having a close friend by your side can boost morale, but the question remains—can Adams turn around the Jets' 2-4 season?Rodgers described Adams' return as surreal and reflected on his remarkable transformation from “fat to fit” by taking Rodgers' advice seriously. When asked if Adams could enhance the Jets' offense, Rodgers confidently stated, “Yeah, I mean, he can do a lot of different things. He can play all three positions: on the ball, receiver, off the ball, and slot. He’s got a high football IQ. I think he’s going to help.” That's high praise for the star wideout.Rodgers also expressed optimism for the team’s younger players, noting,“I think he can help teach the young guys who are willing and eager to listen coz he’s a master of route running and releases. He’s always working on his craft.” On his on-field chemistry with Adams, he added, “We click. I mean we could literally watch a highlight clip and both of us not only know the game, but the play in the situation and the thoughts that were behind and maybe a conversation that happened. So that’s a gift.” The statistics certainly backup Rodgers’ enthusiasm. (Via: EssentiallySports)The Green Bay Packers locker room was a powerhouse for Aaron Rodgers and Davante Adams. Together, they lit up the field, with Adams racking up 622 catches, 7,590 yards, and 69 touchdowns in 108 games. Rodgers thrived alongside him, boasting a passer rating of 103.5, 28,368 yards, and 237 touchdowns. Yet, before reuniting with his old teammate, Rodgers criticized Mike Williams for the loss to the Bills.The Jets endured a disappointing Week 6, falling to the Buffalo Bills 20-23. Their performance was marred by red zone struggles, missed kicks, and penalties, but Aaron Rodgers notably highlighted a key mistake by wide receiver Mike Williams. “It’s two vertical [routes]. Allen [Lazard] is down the seam and Mike is down the red line. I’m looking at Allen, he puts his hand up and three guys go with him. So I’m throwing a no-look to the red line. And when I peek my eyes back there, [Williams] is running an in-breaker. He’s got to be on the red line. It’s the little things every single time.” he stated.This miscommunication proved costly, especially when the Jets needed a conversion on third-and-16, leading to an interception by Taron Johnson. Williams’ struggles extend beyond this moment; he has yet to score a touchdown this season, accumulating just 145 yards and 10 receptions with a longest catch of 22 yards.In contrast, Davante Adams of the Las Vegas Raiders is in excellent form, with 18 catches, 209 yards, and a touchdown over three games. The seasoned receiver boasts impressive career stats, including 10,990 yards and 96 touchdowns across 153 games.The Jets will look to turn their fortunes around against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Monday, October 21, at Acrisure Stadium, as fans eagerly await the potential Rodgers-Adams connection to spark a turnaround.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes delivers strong message to Travis Kelce and team following Chiefs' shocking offensive stats","New York Jets QB Aaron Rodgers has reason to celebrate: his former teammate, Davante Adams, is back in the locker room.

Jerry Jones loses it on Radio after Cowboys' Birthday blowout



Jerry Jones lashes out at radio hosts after Dallas Cowboys loss | Pro Football Talk | NFL on NBC

How did the radio hosts respond to Jerry Jones' anger?



Power and frustration collided on air when Jerry Jones lashed out at the hosts of 105.3 The Fan following a disastrous Cowboys game. His explosive interview, fueled by birthday disappointment after the Lions' blowout win, put the spotlight on Jones' temper—and the pressures media faces when questioning powerful NFL figures.Here’s how NFL commentators and insiders are weighing in on this media meltdown.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes delivers strong message to Travis Kelce and team following Chiefs' shocking offensive stats The Cowboys' recent game was a disaster, leaving Jerry Jones to witness a crushing loss to the Lions on his birthday. This setback likely fueled his frustration, leading to an explosive interview on 105.3 The Fan’s “Shan and RJ” the following Tuesday. When questioned about upgrades to the Cowboys’ roster, Jones lost his temper and even threatened the radio hosts.This incident exposes a troubling side of NFL media , withMike Florio commenting on Sunday Night Football on NFL on NBC that Jones clearly crossed the line. He noted, “….they haven’t been to the conference Championship game in 30 years, I think the hosts were totally fair trying to ask him why isn’t this? What it’s supposed to be? Yeah, Jerry [Jones] crossed the line here, he was out of line.” (via: EssentiallySports)Florio and co-host Michael Holley also pointed out that Jones' outburst illustrates the power dynamics in sports media, particularly how influential figures like the billionaire owner of the Cowboys can exert pressure on local media outlets, even if they don’t directly pay them.Florio views this as indicative of a broader issue within NFL media, where teams and owners expect reporters to conform and shy away from tough questions. Jerry Jones has attempted to justify his recent outburst to The Athletic’s Dianna Russini, stating,“I don’t know that I would go as far as (calling) the volume connotation as yelling. OK? But the facts are that if I’m going to be grilled by the tribunal, I don’t need it to be by the guys I’m paying.”He added, “I can take it from fans and take it from other people. I take a lot of pride in how fair and how much I try to work with the media, we’re brothers and sisters. But I was a little frustrated there today. … The wrong ones were doing the questioning.” This response seems vague at best, arguably attempting to justify his emotional reaction, which may have negatively impacted the show's hosts.After facing the threat of termination from Jerry Jones, the hosts of 105.3 The Fan, Shan Shariff and RJ Choppy, no longer seem to hold the 82-year-old in high regard. On Wednesday morning’s show, they recapped the incident, sharing their perspectives on Jones’ recent outburst.Shariff expressed his frustration, stating,“It’s really insulting, really demeaning, really insulting and again, out of nowhere. We have done 14 years of interviews with this man.” RJ Choppy echoed his sentiment, adding, “I didn’t get upset with it, but it was like, ‘You know what? Screw you man.”Furthermore, Shariff clarified that although they enjoy special privileges—“like access to Jones, head coach Mike McCarthy and certain players”—due to their show airing on the Cowboys’ flagship station, it’s Audacy that pays them, not Jones. This has led the hosts to feel insulted by the Dallas team owner.Also Read: Shannon Sharpe slams Kevin Stefanski for relying on Deshaun Watson despite disappointing performances for Browns",Jerry Jones lashed out at the hosts of 105.3 The Fan following a disastrous Cowboys game.
