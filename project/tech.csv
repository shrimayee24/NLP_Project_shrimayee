They also put a hilarious name to the school 'Epstein day school'.""We have kid spitting on each other and everything else since they heard their beloved Miss Hailey say ""spit on that thang"" on YouTube,"" the satire piece said.So no, the 'hawk tuah' girl was not actually fired from her job but somebody else was for using that meme.

Health risks of laptop heat on your body; here's what every user should know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/laptops-pc/health-risks-of-laptop-heat-on-your-body-heres-what-every-user-should-know/articleshow/111239097.cms,"What are the common sources of laptop heat

Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU): The CPU and GPU are the primary sources of heat in a laptop. These components perform complex computations and processes, which generate significant heat, especially during intensive tasks like gaming, video editing, or running multiple applications.

Battery: Laptop batteries, especially during charging and discharging, can produce considerable heat. Older batteries or those in poor condition tend to overheat more frequently.

Hard Drive and Solid State Drive (SSD): Data processing and storage activities within hard drives and SSDs also contribute to heat generation, although SSDs typically generate less heat compared to traditional hard drives.

Cooling systems: Fans and heat sinks are designed to dissipate heat away from the laptop's internal components. However, dust accumulation and inadequate ventilation can impair their effectiveness, leading to increased surface temperatures.

External environment: Using laptops in hot environments or on surfaces that block ventilation, such as beds or couches, can exacerbate overheating issues.

Health effects of laptop heat on human body

Skin burns and heat rash: Prolonged contact with a hot laptop can cause skin burns or heat rash, especially on the thighs and legs. This condition, often referred to as ""toasted skin syndrome"" or erythema ab igne, is characterised by red, mottled skin.

Reproductive health issues: For men, placing a laptop on the lap for extended periods can increase scrotal temperature, potentially affecting sperm quality and fertility.

Musculoskeletal problems: The discomfort from laptop heat can lead to poor posture as users adjust their position to avoid the heat. This can result in musculoskeletal issues, including back and neck pain.

Discomfort and reduced productivity: The general discomfort caused by excessive heat can hinder concentration and productivity, leading to a less efficient work environment.

Ways to reduce the impact of laptop heat

Use a laptop cooling pad: Cooling pads provide additional ventilation and help dissipate heat away from the laptop, reducing its surface temperature.

Avoid direct contact: Place your laptop on a desk or table instead of your lap. If using it on your lap is necessary, use a laptop stand or a cushion to create a barrier between your skin and the device.

Maintain good ventilation: Ensure that your laptop's vents are not obstructed. Clean the vents regularly to remove dust and improve airflow.

Take breaks: Taking regular breaks can prevent prolonged exposure to heat. This also promotes better posture and reduces the risk of musculoskeletal problems.

Update software: Keep your laptop's software and drivers updated. Updates often include performance improvements that can reduce heat generation.

Monitor temperature: Use software tools to monitor your laptop's temperature. This can help you take proactive measures if the device starts to overheat.

Service your laptop: Regular maintenance, including cleaning the internal components and replacing thermal paste, can improve your laptop's cooling efficiency.

Choose a well-ventilated environment: Using your laptop in a cool, well-ventilated environment can significantly reduce overheating issues.

'You can’t suppress it forever': Prince Harry opens up about losing mother Diana at 12,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/you-cant-suppress-it-forever-prince-harry-opens-up-about-losing-mother-diana-at-12/articleshow/111300423.cms,"Prince Harry’s Afternoon with Scotty’s

BBC News Feature on Event with Prince Harry

NEW DELHI: Prince Harry has appeared in a new video discussing grief , encouraging children and young people to express their emotions. Speaking as a global ambassador for Scotty’s Little Soldiers, a charity that supports kids who have lost parents in the military, Harry shared his personal experiences.Having lost his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, at the age of 12, he offers his perspective on coping with loss.The video, shot in May and released ahead of Armed Forces Day, aims to highlight the support needs of bereaved military children in the UK.Harry spoke frankly about the misconceptions children can have after losing a loved one. He explained that it can be easy to convince oneself that prolonged sadness is necessary to prove the person is missed. He said, however, that the lost loved one would likely want the living to find happiness.""It’s so easy as a kid to think or convince yourself….you convince yourself that the person you’ve lost wants you, or you need to be sad for as long as possible to prove to them that they are missed. But then there’s this realisation of, no, they must want me to be happy,"" he said.Prince Harry, 39, has previously criticised what he feels was a lack of family support following his mother’s death in 1997. He believes this led him to suppress his emotions until he sought therapy. He stressed the importance of talking about loss as a way to celebrate the lives of those who have passed.""That’s the hardest thing, especially for kids, I think, which is, 'I don’t want to talk about it because it will make me sad, but once realising that if I do talk about it, I’m celebrating their life, then actually, things become easier'… as opposed to this 'I’m just not going to talk about it, and that’s the best form of coping,' when in fact it’s not. It can be for a period of time…you can’t suppress it forever. It’s not sustainable. And will eat away at you inside,"" he added.Addressing the difficulty of discussing painful topics, he noted the natural defense mechanisms that come into play. ""No one wants to be in the position where they are forced to talk about the very thing they don’t want to talk about, especially when every defense mechanism in your mind, nervous system and everything else is saying 'do not go there',"" he said.The video features a conversation with Nikki Scott, founder of Scotty’s Little Soldiers. She recounted the heart-wrenching moment she had to tell her five-year-old son, Kai, that his father, Cpl Lee Scott, had been killed in Afghanistan in 2009. At the time, she also had a seven-month-old daughter, Brooke.The charity released the video to draw attention to the ongoing needs of bereaved military children. Scott was inspired to create Scotty’s Little Soldiers after witnessing the positive effects a family holiday had on her grieving son.Expressing his admiration for Scott’s work, Harry said, ""What you’ve done is incredible. It is truly inspirational. I’m really honored and privileged to be part of Scotty’s now and I really look forward to us doing everything we can to bring in more people, more interest, raise more funds and be able to get the message out there to get more kids the support they so desperately need.""Scotty’s Little Soldiers currently supports over 680 members and estimates that each year 2,100 children are newly bereaved of a parent who served in the British Armed Forces. The charity's mission is to ensure these children receive the emotional support they need to cope with their loss and lead fulfilling lives.The video aims to help children understand that expressing their feelings is a vital part of healing. Through this initiative, Prince Harry hopes to bring attention to the importance of open conversations about grief and loss.","Prince Harry is a global ambassador for Scotty's Little Soldiers, a charity that supports kids who have lost parents in the military.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme . This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy . Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Service bots get our lingo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/service-bots-get-our-lingo/articleshow/111329125.cms,"Moving to complex functions

Indic language capability

is a little expensive now

The other day I decided to check out an airline’s chatbot to see how it works. I keyed in: “I’m travelling with my 8-year-old son, recommend the best flight without disturbing his sleep”. It asked for my source and destination, which I gave as Chennai and Hyderabad. It asked for the date. I typed ₹Mon’ (for Monday), but it did not recognise what I meant.I typed ₹tom’, it correctly recognised it as tomorrow.The bot responded that there were no flights that “fully meet” my specified criteria and provided a bunch of options. I then asked for the cheapest flight, and non-stop flights. The options it provided were correct – I confirmed that on MakeMyTrip and Google Flights. It automatically filled the passenger list as 1 adult and 1 child for booking. It even clarified the availability of gluten free food for my fictional son.Customer support bots have come a long way from the days of clunky bots that only answered FAQs. These sophisticated generative AI-based tools are much better than their predecessors, though still far from perfect. Sometimes they ask silly questions even after being explicitly told. They struggle to recognise colloquial words, have woefully poor memory, unlike human agents. But at least you don’t have to listen to hold music for 15 minutes.The leap comes from GenAI ’s ability to understand conversations better, their ability to understand multilingual queries , and support for interfaces like voice and videos. As these systems improve, customer support will become a lot quicker and easier for users, and hugely cheaper for companies, since they won’t have to hire thousands of contact centre staff.Ramprakash Ramamoorthy, director of AI Research at Zoho Corp, says with GenAI, the next goal is to make customer assistant bots do more complex and autonomous functions. He says they could hand over the issue to human agents when it figures it can’t handle it. He says they may even be able to process warranty claims, for instance. “As soon as you reach out, the system will be able to cross-check the database for similar issues/ queries where warranty claims are applicable. A human agent will have to call a supervisor to do the same job,” he says.But these are still some time away. Even for basic customer support services, companies are being careful due to concerns around data privacy, and hallucination. Nobody, after all, wants to get into a situation like Air Canada did earlier this year when its chatbot offered a discount to a customer that it wasn’t supposed to.Chaitanya Chokkareddy, cofounder of Ozonetel, the Hyderabadbased customer experience tech provider, says the focus currently is on automating the most common, repetitive queries. Chatbots, he says, fail in non-common areas of work.He says a lot of work is happening with AI in the back-end like data analysis, summary, intent analysis, and quality control, focusing on efficiency and productivity of human customer agents and improving margins of companies. “We handle about 20 million calls per day which last about 3 to 5 minutes each, and a lot of that data is currently not accessible to managers to make better decisions on their product and services. Demand for back-end services is higher than customer facing applications,” he says.While AI assistants perform relatively well in English, their performance in Indic languages is not great. Ozonetel is building Telugu language tokenisation by working with a non-profit and 1 lakh student interns to build a Telugu database. But Indian languages, he says, cost around 5x to 10x more compared to English because of the complex tokenisation of Indian languages compared to the Roman alphabet. “AI models are charged based on usage and chatbots using Indic scripts have more tokens and hence have higher computational costs. In many cases, the costs are equivalent to a human being and so our customers don’t want to automate,” Chaitanya says.Ankush Sabharwal’s CoRover.ai also has a local language model called BharatGPT. The bot can respond to voice queries in Indian languages, and provide tailored information. It also has video chatbots with pre-generated videos and text-to-video conversion and lip sync, which can be used for purposes like internal training.Ankush says redundant workload should be automated first, and as the adoption increases, more clear use cases will emerge. He says problems like hallucination can be reduced with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and use of domain-specific small models.Abhiroop Medhekar, founder & CEO of financing platform Velocity, says they have built text-to-speech and speech-to-text tech for AI-agent voice call automation. They initially used it internally and then started commercial offerings. “Some BFSI applications require an immediate response from customers, but customers frequently don’t respond to mails or WhatsApp reminders. The current robotic IVR calls are not effective either. But these GenAI-based voice calls are interactive and provide better results,” he says.","Chatbots have come a long way from the days of clunky bots that only answered FAQs.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

Save money on your OTT subscriptions with these best tips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/save-money-on-your-ott-subscriptions-with-these-best-tips/articleshow/111267043.cms,"Tips to slash your OTT subscription costs

Evaluate your subscriptions

How often do you use each service?

Are there overlapping content offerings?

Which services offer the most value for your viewing preferences?

Take advantage of free trials

Bundle subscriptions

Share subscriptions with family and friends

Look for discounts and promotions

Opt for ad-supported plans

Downgrade to a lower tier

Cancel unused subscriptions

Take advantage of yearly plans

Keep an eye on price increases

Rotate OTT subscriptions based on content releases

Use cashback and reward programs

Use public libraries

Monitor your viewing habits

In the age of streaming, Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms have completely transformed the way we consume entertainment. These platforms offer a vast array of content, from movies and TV shows to documentaries and live sports, making it possible to access virtually any type of entertainment on demand. The convenience and variety offered by OTT services have led to their widespread adoption, and many households now subscribe to multiple streaming platforms to cater to diverse viewing preferences.However, with the increasing number of available options, managing multiple subscriptions can become overwhelming and costly. Each platform typically requires a separate subscription fee, and these costs can quickly add up, putting a strain on your budget. Moreover, the abundance of content across various services means that it's easy to subscribe to more than you actually need or use, leading to unnecessary expenses.Fortunately, there are several strategies you can employ to save money on OTT subscriptions without sacrificing your viewing experience. By being strategic about your subscription choices and making the most of available offers and features, you can enjoy your favourite shows and movies while keeping costs under control.The first step towards saving on OTT subscriptions is to evaluate your current subscriptions. List all the streaming services you subscribe to and consider the following:By assessing your usage and preferences, you can identify subscriptions to cancel or downgrade. If you rarely watch content on a particular platform, consider cancelling it and redirecting those funds to a service you use more frequently.Many OTT platforms offer free trials for new users, ranging from a week to a month. Use these free trials to explore different services and their content libraries without committing financially. Set reminders to cancel the trial before it ends to avoid charges. You can also take turns using free trials from different platforms to enjoy their content without paying for multiple subscriptions simultaneously.Many streaming services provide bundled packages that combine multiple subscriptions at a reduced price. For instance, Disney+ offers a bundle that includes Hulu and ESPN+ for less than the cost of subscribing to each service separately. Search for bundles that match your viewing habits and preferences to save money.Many OTT platforms permit multiple profiles or simultaneous streaming on various devices. Utilise this feature by sharing subscriptions with family members or friends. Split the cost of a subscription among multiple users to reduce individual expenses. Check each platform's terms of service to ensure you are not violating any rules.Watch for discounts and promotions from OTT platforms, as many services provide special deals during holidays, anniversaries, or other significant events. Additionally, some platforms provide discounts for students, military personnel, and senior citizens. Sign up for newsletters or follow the platforms on social media to stay informed about upcoming promotions.Many streaming services provide ad-supported plans at a reduced cost compared to their ad-free versions. Although watching ads might be a slight inconvenience, it can lead to substantial savings. Evaluate whether ad-supported plans are a viable option for you, especially if the cost difference is substantial.If you don't need all the features offered by your current subscription tier, consider downgrading to a lower tier. If you're currently subscribed to a premium plan that includes 4K streaming but primarily watch content on a standard HD screen, transitioning to a standard plan could be a cost-saving option. Evaluate your viewing habits and requirements to decide if downgrading to a lower-tier plan would meet your needs effectively.Over time, it's common to collect multiple subscriptions, some of which may remain unused. Regularly assess your subscriptions and cancel those that are no longer in use. This straightforward action can redirect funds to more worthwhile purposes. Be vigilant about monitoring cancellation deadlines to prevent unnecessary charges for services you no longer require.Choosing a yearly plan instead of monthly subscriptions can lead to significant savings. Numerous OTT platforms offer discounts on annual subscriptions, equating to several months of service for free compared to monthly rates. Opting for a yearly plan is a prudent decision if you anticipate long-term use of a service, ensuring cost-effectiveness in the long run.Streaming services occasionally increase their subscription prices. Stay informed about upcoming price hikes and evaluate whether the service still offers good value at the new rate. If a price increase makes a subscription less affordable, consider switching to a different service or taking advantage of available promotions.The content offerings on OTT platforms are dynamic, regularly updating with new movies and shows while removing others. To optimise your savings, consider rotating your subscriptions according to the release schedules of your preferred content. Subscribe to a service for a period, enjoy the content you want, then cancel and switch to another platform. This method ensures you only pay for subscriptions when actively watching content that aligns with your current interests.Certain credit cards and cashback apps provide rewards for streaming service transactions, allowing you to earn cashback or points that can be used towards future subscriptions. Additionally, several OTT platforms have referral programs that offer incentives such as free months of service for referring new subscribers. These programs can help you maximise savings and get more value out of your streaming subscriptions.Several public libraries collaborate with streaming platforms like Kanopy and Hoopla to provide complimentary access to their services. Contact your local library to inquire about available OTT services, enabling you to enjoy a wide selection of movies and shows at no extra expense.Finally, paying attention to your viewing habits can assist you in making well-informed choices regarding your subscriptions. Monitor the time you spend on each platform and the types of content you enjoy the most. This data can help you select subscriptions that are not only cost-effective but also cater to your entertainment preferences effectively.","In the age of streaming, Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms have completely transformed the way we consume entertainment.

Apple Intelligence launch in China may face these three ‘challenges’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-intelligence-launch-in-china-may-face-these-three-challenges/articleshow/111147927.cms,"Tough rules for AI models

Ban on ChatGPT, which will be integrated in Apple devices

Privacy, a core focus for Apple

China has tough rules for AI models

Ban on OpenAI’s ChatGPT in China

Private Cloud Compute

Apple has announced Apple Intelligence , a suite of AI features that will run on iPhones, iPads and Mac PCs. The AI features will be available later this year to users globally, including China – one the most critical markets for the company. However, the company’s big AI push may face some challenges in China as regulators have in place strict rules around the technology amid tough competition.The three challenges that the company may face in China are (via CNBC):China’s AI market is tightly regulated and all companies launching AI models must have approval from the regulators for the commercial use of LLMs.The country has also made it mandatory for Generative AI providers to take down “illegal” content.Since some of the features of Apple Intelligence are developed by the company itself, Apple will likely need to get its AI model approved by authorities under Chinese rules.China has also banned OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Some of Apple’s voice assistant Siri’s capabilities are dependent on ChatGPT. This could mean that Apple may have to find a local AI company that provides the same level of capabilities as ChatGPT. Baidu and Alibaba are among China’s technology giants that have their own LLMs and voice assistants.Apple's AI launch highlighted a focus on user privacy. Their new system, Private Cloud Compute, processes user data on Apple-owned servers, with the company claiming the data itself is not stored.However, in China, Apple's iCloud data is stored on servers located locally and operated by a third party. This may raise concerns about whether Apple can maintain complete control over its AI computing servers in the country.This means that Apple must have a similar partnership for its AI servers in the region to keep user data private.","Apple has announced Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that will run on iPhones, iPads and Mac PCs.

Starting June 25, HDFC Bank will stop sending text alerts for low-value UPI transactions. This means that HDFC Bank customers will receive SMS alerts for UPI transactions exceeding Rs 100 when sending money and similar notification for when received is above Rs 500. However, the bank will continue to send email alerts for all transactions with no absolutely change.In a mail as well as SMS alert sent to its customers, HDFC Bank said: “Starting from 25th June, 2024: Email Alerts: Continue to receive email alerts for all UPI transactions.SMS Notifications: Now only for transactions above Rs 100 (money sent/paid) and Rs 500 (money received).”This change aligns with banking norms, which require text messages for transactions over Rs 5,000. Despite this, many banks send alerts for lower-value debits as well. HDFC Bank stated that feedback indicated alerts for low-value transactions were deemed 'not useful,' as there is often duplication of notifications from UPI payment apps.Bankers noted that bulk text messages cost between Rs 0.01-0.03 each. With UPI transactions averaging around 40 crores per day, banks collectively spend several crores daily on text message alerts.Banks are also promoting the use of UPI Lite for transactions up to Rs 500. UPI Lite allows a small amount of money to be set aside by the app, facilitating quick payments without the need for second-factor authentication.By reducing the frequency of low-value transaction alerts, HDFC Bank and others aim to streamline notifications for customers while also cutting costs.

iPhone 16 case leaked: This is what the upcoming iPhone may look like,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/iphone-16-case-leaked-this-is-what-the-upcoming-iphone-may-look-like/articleshow/111236649.cms,"iPhone 16 design change: What to expect



Apple is expected to launch its next-gen iPhone 16 series models in September. However, rumours and speculations related to the upcoming iPhones are already making the rounds on the internet. Now, a new leak suggests that the iPhone 16 may get a major design overhaul.In a post shared on the social media platform X (earlier Twitter), a tipster named Ice Universe shared a video showing the alleged case of the upcoming iPhone 16.The leaked case reveals that the upcoming iPhone 16 may have a vertical rear camera setup, similar to the one that was last seen on iPhone 12.The new case design also reveals a new cutout at the right side of the phone which may house a dedicated camera shutter button for the iPhone 16 Pro models.The dedicated shutter button which is expected to come powered by the company’s haptic engine is rumoured to join the existing physical buttons. This button may use a soft tap for focus and a double tap/hard press for capture, offering an improved camera experience.This alignment will reportedly enable spatial video recording capabilities similar to iPhone 15 Pro which has two cameras stacked vertically while the third camera is arranged diagonally.However, the latest rumours contradict earlier reports that suggested that the iPhone 16 may arrive with a buttonless design.The leaked case also suggests that Apple may be adding more buttons alongside the volume and power controls. The customisable ""Action"" button, which was introduced in iPhone 15 Pro, may also make a return in iPhone 16. This button also has the potential to replace the mute switch and offer users programmable functionalities. If these rumours are to be true, it would significantly alter the look and feel of the iPhone 16 lineup.","A new leak suggests that the iPhone 16 may get a major design overhaul.
