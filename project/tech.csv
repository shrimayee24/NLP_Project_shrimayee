"Went hands-on with Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Edge, and it’s the haute couture of phones",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/reviews/went-hands-on-with-samsungs-galaxy-s25-edge-and-its-the-haute-couture-of-phones/articleshow/121266099.cms,"

Barely there, fully here

Expect the unexpected



The price conundrum

True elegance, as the fashion world knows, lies in the perfect silhouette, and Samsung has translated that ethos into the Galaxy S25 Edge . When the company first teased its super-thin phone in January, many scoffed. In an age of ever-larger batteries and camera arrays, who would choose artful minimalism over raw practicality? And yet here we are, four months on, holding the S25 Edge , still getting used to how different it feels. Its slender form cuts through the sea of look-alikes, reminding us that sometimes a quiet gesture leaves the deepest impression.The dimensions tell you it's thin, at 5.8mm, but numbers don't prepare you for how it actually feels in hand. It's almost disconcertingly light at just 163g, barely heavier than the much smaller standard S25 with its 6.2-inch display. This phone manages a magic trick that photos simply can't convey. In isolated images, it looks like any other sleek Samsung slab. It's only when placed beside other phones that the dimensional difference becomes apparent. Put it next to some of the phones nearby, and the Edge appears almost impossibly slim, like something from a concept render rather than a production device.What's most remarkable is how this lightness transforms the experience of using a large-screen phone. The 6.7-inch display is identical in size to the S25 Plus, but the drastically reduced weight makes one-handed use far less fatiguing. My wrists didn't ache after extended scrolling sessions, and the phone practically disappeared in my pocket, a welcome change from the brick-like presence of most modern flagships.Samsung hasn't compromised on durability despite the slim profile. The Edge uses the same titanium frame as the S25 Ultra, which feels cool and premium to the touch. It's also the first phone to feature Corning's new Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2, which promises enhanced crack resistance, though it lacks the anti-reflective properties of the Ultra's Gorilla Armor 2 coating. Add in the expected IP68 water and dust resistance, and this is a surprisingly robust device despite its delicate appearance.The camera housing is a curious departure from Samsung's recent design language, unlike the other S25 models with their visually cohesive camera arrays, the Edge sports a unique dual-lens setup that looks distinctly different. It's an odd break in Samsung's usually consistent family design, and similarly odd break in Samsung’s usually consistent habit of putting in a telephoto lens in Galaxy S phones, as the Galaxy S25 Edge doesn’t have one (more on that a few paragraphs later.)Thin phones used to mean less. The Edge changes that. Beyond its dramatic dimensions, the S25 Edge is essentially built from parts of its siblings. Samsung seems to have cherry-picked elements from across the S25 lineup to create something that sits between the Plus and Ultra in both features and price.From the Galaxy S25 Ultra , it inherits the 200MP main camera sensor and titanium frame. From the S25 Plus, it takes the identical 6.7-inch AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate and those perfectly flat edges. And from the base S25, it borrows the slower 25W charging and, unfortunately, a smaller-than-expected battery.Under the hood, you'll find the same Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset powering the entire S25 lineup, paired with a generous 12GB of RAM. And all that AI that’s Samsung flaunts for other of its S25 phones, that’s also here.One thing that Samsung couldn’t help cutting is the battery. Speaking of which, the 3,900mAh cell is perhaps the Edge's most concerning specification. It's smaller than even the base S25's 4,000mAh battery, despite powering a significantly larger display. Samsung claims up to 24 hours of video playback, but that's still five hours less than the S25 and six less than the Plus. Time will tell whether the Edge can make it through a full day of real-world usage.The another obvious sacrifice is in the camera department. The Edge sports just two rear lenses: that impressive 200MP main sensor and a 12MP ultrawide. There's no telephoto lens whatsoever, which feels like a significant omission for a ever-so-premium phone in 2025. Samsung has attempted to compensate leveraging that high-resolution main sensor for 2x zoom crops, although the digital zoom is limited to 10x (compared to 30x on other S25 models). There's no getting around the versatility hit.The Edge does gain one unique feature over its siblings, though — Log video recording through the 12MP selfie camera, which even the Ultra doesn't offer. It's an interesting addition that content creators might appreciate, though it feels like an odd exclusive feature.This is where the plot thickens, just slightly . The Galaxy S25 Edge comes at Rs 109,999, positioning it firmly as a premium flagship. That places it above the Rs 99,999 S25 Plus and just short of the Ultra’s Rs 1,29,999 price tag, creating a somewhat awkward position in Samsung's lineup.For that premium, you're primarily paying for the engineering achievement and the unique experience of an ultra-thin, ultra-light phone with a large display. Whether this premium is justified will largely depend on how much you value the Edge's singular design achievement.After my brief time with the device, I can say the experience of using something this thin and light is genuinely refreshing, a distinctive departure from the increasingly homogeneous phone landscape. But whether that novelty translates into practical benefits during day-to-day use remains to be seen, and if you’re someone who’s waiting to know the same, you should probably wait for our full review.","The Galaxy S25 Edge has a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate.

If you're stuck, we've got you covered—with helpful hints, category explanations, and today's final answers. Let's dive in.Connections is a daily word game developed by The New York Times and edited by Wyna Liu. It challenges players to identify groups of four related words from a pool of sixteen. These connections can range from straightforward themes (like types of fruit) to more clever or abstract links (like homophones or metaphors). The goal is to correctly group the words into four sets, each reflecting a specific theme or pattern. It’s a game of logic, language, and a little bit of luck.Here’s how the game works:You’re presented with 16 words.Your task is to sort these into four groups of four that share a common connection.The connections could be anything—TV shows, synonyms, board game terms, parts of the body, homophones, and more.You can shuffle the words for a fresh perspective.You get four chances to make mistakes before the game ends.Each group is color-coded by difficulty:You can play it online through the NYT Games app or directly on the New York Times website.Need a little nudge before you dive into the answers? Here are some themed hints to point you in the right direction without giving the game away:If you're still stumped, here are the exact themes used in today’s puzzle:Yellow: Fundraising eventGreen: Spaces on a Monopoly boardBlue: Features of a toothed whalePurple: Homophones for parts of the footHere are the four correct groupings for today’s puzzle, Connections #708:Yellow — Fundraising Event:BALL, BENEFIT, FUNCTION, GALAThese words all represent types of social gatherings often organized for fundraising purposes.Green — Spaces on a Monopoly Board:AVENUE, CHANCE, RAILROAD, UTILITYEach of these appears on a traditional Monopoly board, falling under different property or card types.Blue — Features of a Toothed Whale:BLUBBER, FLIPPER, FLUKE, MELONThese are all anatomical features found on toothed whales. ""Melon,"" for instance, refers to the fatty organ involved in echolocation.Purple — Homophones for Parts of the Foot:BAWL, HEAL, SOUL, TOWThese are homophones for “ball,” “heel,” “sole,” and “toe.” This category was a bit trickier due to its reliance on sound-alike words.Today’s Connections puzzle was a clever mix of straightforward categories and subtle wordplay. If you managed to solve it all—well done! And if you didn’t, no worries; the beauty of the game lies in the challenge, and there’s always a new one tomorrow.

Apple Pay down: Outage disrupts digital payments as users report widespread issues,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-pay-down-outage-disrupts-digital-payments-as-users-report-widespread-issues/articleshow/121219458.cms,"Apple Pay Outage

Apple Pay outage: Widespread user reports highlight major disruption

Apple's status page confirms the outage

Resolution and current status

Impact on users and financial transactions

Apple Pay , one of the world's most widely used digital payment platforms, experienced a significant outage on May 16, 2025, affecting thousands of users across the United States. As per reports, the disruption, which began around 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time left many unable to make transactions, access their digital wallets, or use related services like Apple Cash and Apple Card. While Apple has since restored most of its services, the incident highlights the growing dependency on digital financial systems and the potential challenges they face.The first signs of the outage appeared when thousands of users began reporting issues on the popular outage tracking platform, Down Detector. At its peak, nearly 3,000 reports were logged, indicating a widespread problem affecting Apple Pay, Wallet, Cash, and Card services. Many users also took to social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, and Bluesky to share their frustrations about being unable to complete routine transactions. Apple Pay is not available in India.For nearly two hours, Apple Pay and Wallet remained inaccessible for many, significantly impacting users who rely on the service for daily purchases, transportation, and peer-to-peer payments. This prompted many to seek alternative payment methods, with some noting the inconvenience of being unable to access ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, which often depend on Apple Pay for quick transactions.Apple's official status page, which initially showed all systems as operational, eventually confirmed the widespread disruption. The page listed ongoing issues with Apple Pay, Apple Wallet, Apple Card, and Apple Cash, stating that ""some users may be experiencing issues with this service."" This acknowledgment came roughly an hour after the first reports surfaced, reflecting a delayed response to the problem.By late morning, Apple had updated its status page to indicate that Apple Cash and Apple Card services had returned to normal, while Apple Pay and Wallet continued to experience problems. Despite these updates, some users continued to report lingering issues, suggesting that the recovery process was not uniform across all regions or devices.As of 11:11 a.m. Pacific Time, Apple reported that all affected services, including Apple Pay and Wallet, had been restored. However, the company's status page provided no specific details about the cause of the outage or the steps taken to resolve it. Apple has not yet released an official statement addressing the incident, and requests for comment have so far gone unanswered.While the outage appears to be resolved for most users, some have continued to report sporadic connectivity issues, indicating that the recovery may still be ongoing for a subset of the user base. The incident also sparked renewed discussions online about the importance of having backup payment options, especially as digital payment systems become more deeply integrated into daily life.The timing of the outage, occurring on a Friday morning, likely added to the inconvenience for users attempting to pay bills, transfer funds, or make weekend plans. The incident also highlights the broader implications of relying on digital payment systems, which, while convenient, can leave users vulnerable to sudden disruptions.Given the scale and duration of the outage, Apple Pay's temporary unavailability serves as a reminder of the critical role digital payment platforms now play in global commerce. It also underscores the need for robust backup systems and clear communication from service providers when technical issues arise.","Apple Pay, one of the world's most widely used digital payment platforms, experienced a significant outage on May 16, 2025.

Bryan Johnson drains all plasma from his body



Science behind plasma replacement



Bryan Johnson’s experiments spark mixed reactions online



Johnson’s experiments blend science with spectacle, causing debate



Also Read |

In the constantly changing universe of longevity science and biohacking, there are few figures who inspire as much fascination—and debate—as Bryan Johnson . The 46-year-old tech mogul, most famous for his multimillion-dollar crusade to reverse biological aging, has again caught public attention. This time, by having performed a procedure that sounds more like science fiction than science reality: a full-body plasma replacement .In a recent Instagram post, Johnson unveiled matter-of-factly, ""I drained all of the plasma from my body,"" saying his doctor described it as ""the cleanest she's ever seen."" To most, such an extreme procedure would be seen as outrageous, even perilous. For Johnson, though, it's merely another step on his individual mission to resist the aging process.This is not Johnson's initial plasma manipulation experiment. Previously, in a highly publicized attempt, he received plasma infusions from his adolescent son as part of what became referred to as the ""blood boy"" procedure under the theory that young blood could revitalize aged tissue—a theory based on disputed animal research.His most recent project, which he is now calling ""V2,"" is an even more extreme iteration of that idea. Rather than just being infused with donor plasma, Johnson had all his plasma taken out and replaced by albumin, the main protein in plasma that serves to control blood volume and transport vital substances throughout the body.As Johnson describes it, the objective of this process is a sort of biological do-over. He asserts that today's body is not able to efficiently get rid of waste and toxins because of lifestyle and environmental choices. By not keeping any of his plasma, he wants to wipe the biochemical clean slate and start over.Although Johnson's plasma replacement therapy is undoubtedly dramatic, its scientific merit is questionable. Transfusions of albumin are medically employed in hospitals to treat certain illnesses such as liver failure or shock, but complete plasma replacement in a healthy subject is very rare and unexplored territory.Johnson has said that his team is tracking a broad range of biomarkers both before and after the procedure to assess its possible impact on longevity, inflammation, and cellular health. Without peer-reviewed data or clinical trials, though, it's impossible to make firm conclusions.In spite of this, Johnson reports the experience as being dull. ""Nothing, really,"" he said he felt afterwards. ""I felt the same, went to bed, slept the same."" Whether this indicates that the treatment did not have any effect—or whether subtleties will manifest themselves in time—is still uncertain.As with most of Johnson's experiments, public reaction has varied from wonder to mockery. Social media users did not hesitate, with one commenting, ""Bro is giving so much free data and results,"" while another recognized, ""If people could keep from getting threatened by the harshness of his actions, they'd really see the potential for value his findings could have towards global longevity.""Others were more cynical, comparing his detailed biohacking regimens with less complicated, time-proven methods of aging. One reader posted a poignant remark, ""My grandmother lived to 100. She liked life, stayed active, and looked great—all without having her blood drained.""However, there is the feeling that—at least controversially—Johnson's work adds worthwhile data to the overall discussion of aging and longevity. His openness to testing himself provides insight into what the future of preventative medicine and personal optimization will be like.Bryan Johnson's experiments remain on the tightrope between medical progress and contemporary performance art. Critics point out that his techniques are expensive, out-of-reach, and maybe even irresponsible. Supporters reply that all science leaps start with experimentation that pushes the boundaries.What is clear is that Johnson's fundamental purpose speaks to a universal human aspiration: to prolong life, augment vitality, and put off the inexorable decay of age. His odyssey poses deeper questions regarding the morality of self-experimentation, the availability of anti-aging technology, and the thin dividing line between ingenuity and mania.",Tech mogul Bryan Johnson has performed a full-body plasma replacement.

"Microsoft's fired AI director to 6,000 laid off employees along with her: ""These are people who…""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/microsofts-fired-ai-director-to-6000-laid-off-employees-along-with-her-these-are-people-who/articleshow/121245726.cms,"Microsoft layoffs 2025 hit 6,000 employees worldwide, including AI Director Gabriela de Queiroz. As the tech giant pushes deeper into artificial intelligence, industry experts question the decision. Find out why even AI leaders weren’t safe from Microsoft’s sudden cuts.

Poll Do you think AI will replace more jobs in the future? No, humans will always be needed. Yes, it's inevitable.

To those also affected—you're not alone, we're at least 6,000, says Microsoft's fired AI director

Microsoft announced last week that it is laying off approximately 6,000 employees, nearly 3% of its global workforce—in what marks the company's second-largest job reduction in its history. Among those affected was Gabriela de Queiroz , Director of Artificial Intelligence for Microsoft for Startups , who shared the ""bittersweet news"" of her departure on social media.""I was impacted by Microsoft's latest round of layoffs. Am I sad? Absolutely. I'm heartbroken to see so many talented people I've had the honor of working with being let go. These are people who cared deeply, went above and beyond, and truly made a difference,"" Gabriela de Queiroz wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter), alongside a picture of herself smiling.The layoffs come as Microsoft aggressively pushes into artificial intelligence, with CEO Satya Nadella revealing in April that AI now writes up to 30% of code in some Microsoft projects. Software engineers bore the brunt of the cuts, representing over 40% of the approximately 2,000 positions eliminated in Washington state alone, according to Bloomberg analysis.Despite being asked to stop work immediately and set an out-of-office message, Gabriela de Queiroz chose to stay longer. ""I chose to stay a little longer—showing up for meetings, saying goodbye, wrapping up what I could. That felt right to me,"" she explained in her social media posts.The irony of laying off an AI director while the company invests heavily in AI technology wasn't lost on industry observers. One Microsoft vice president recently told his team to use AI chatbots to generate half their computer code, up from the current 20-30%, before more than a dozen engineers on his team were subsequently laid off.""But if you know me, you know I always look at the bright side. I'm an optimist at heart. That hasn't changed. My smile, my gratitude, my belief that each day is a gift—that's all still here,"" Gabriela de Queiroz wrote, maintaining her positive outlook despite the circumstances.The cuts affect all levels, teams, and geographies as Microsoft streamlines operations and reduces management layers. ""What's next? I don't know yet. It's too soon to say. But I trust that something good will come out of this,"" Gabriela de Queiroz concluded, addressing fellow impacted employees: ""To those also affected—you're not alone. We are at least 6,000.""","Microsoft announced last week that it is laying off approximately 6,000 employees, nearly 3% of its global workforce.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Google’s Sundar Pichai calls R1 ‘impressive’

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has praised the Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) startup DeepSeek’s flagship model, R1, saying that it is the first large language model (LLM) that he’s seen to rival OpenAI’s performance – essentially keeping it on a higher pedestal than Google’s Gemini and the one that powers Grok, the AI chatbot by Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI.“OpenAI has been so far ahead that no one's really come close,” Nadella told Bloomberg Businessweek.“DeepSeek, and R1 in particular, was the first model I’ve seen post some points,” added Nadella.Microsoft began offering R1 through its Azure AI Foundry in January, alongside models from OpenAI, Meta and Mistral. Microsoft VP Asha Sharma said R1 underwent “rigorous red teaming and safety evaluations” before being made available, and emphasized that data processed through Azure would not be routed to DeepSeek’s servers in China.DeepSeek made waves earlier this year when it launched R1, impressing both the tech industry and investors. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the competition, calling R1 “an impressive model” and noting its strong performance at a lower cost. He added that DeepSeek’s emergence prompted OpenAI to accelerate some product releases.Even Google CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the ‘impressive work’ of DeepSeek's team Alphabet’s Q4 2024 earnings call earlier this year.“I think [DeepSeek has] a tremendous team. I think they've done very, very good work,” Pichai said.R1’s popularity surged in January when its free chatbot app topped Apple’s US App Store, sparking concerns among investors about potential impacts on demand for AI hardware like Nvidia chips. DeepSeek’s ability to deliver high-quality models at a lower price triggered a sell-off in AI-related stocks.However, Ben Buchanan, a former AI advisor in the former US President Joe Biden administration, suggested the hype may be overstated.“DeepSeek’s engineers are extremely talented,” he said on The Ezra Klein Show, adding that their breakthroughs are largely in line with algorithmic efficiency work seen across the industry.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella praises DeepSeek's flagship model, R1.

But his lack of selfcontrol cost him his annual bonus/ NYT (Screengrab)





With a keen sense of smell and legs that seem too short for his body, Fu Zai has won a huge social media audience that has followed him doing official duties since he started as a sniffer dog last fall. He was a puppy when a trainer spotted him at a park and recruited him to Weifang Public Security Bureau in Shandong.A love of earning treats as rewards has earned Fu Zai strong performance reviews. But it’s also proved a challenge, as his trainer has found that keeping him in line is not easy.Fu Zai was caught on camera recently grabbing a bite of a sausage in a child’s hand during patrol. Officers have since tried to train him to better resist food, but many on social media offered support — and free sausages — for Fu Zai the next time he patrolled the streets. In another video, some of the corgi’s toys and snacks — part of a Lunar New Year “bonus”— were confiscated for sleeping on the job and using his bowl as a urinal. Experts said such behaviour is normal for corgis. “That’s why they’re challenging, too, because they get distracted pretty easily,” said Leonardo Palacio, owner of a training school in Connecticut.Fu Zai is an unusual choice for police work. Traditionally, corgis were bred to work on farms, herding cattle by biting their ankles.In recent times, they have become popular choices for pets, most famously associated with Queen Elizabeth II. But some have retained the propensity to nip. That trait might dissuade trainers when assessing the suitability of a dog for disciplined forces, said a trainer at Hong Kong Canine.Fu Zai’s trainer said he had initially ruled out a corgi as a police dog because of the breed’s reputation. Meeting Fu Zai changed his mind. He later invited Fu Zai to train at the police base. Over the next few months, the corgi excelled in detecting explosives. Moreover, he could fit under tight spaces some other dogs couldn’t reach.Fu Zai became a full-fledged member of Weifang police in Oct. He has since been beamed around the internet as a friendly face for the force, making frequent appearances on its official account on Douyin, China’s version of TikTok. A separate account, named “Fu Zai and his comrades,” has more than 400,000 followers. But the drive for food that helped him land the job also gotten him into some of his troubles. Whether as temptation he can’t resist or a treat used in training, there will probably be more sausage in Fu Zai’s future.","Fu Zai was a puppy when a trainer spotted him at a park and recruited him to Weifang Public Security Bureau in Shandong.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim.

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What Elon Musk's Grok coming to Azure means for OpenAI

What Elon Musk's Grok coming to Azure means for Microsoft

In a surprising announcement at its annual Build developer conference, Microsoft revealed that it is expanding its Azure AI Foundry model offerings to include Grok 3 and Grok 3 mini from xAI, the AI startup founded by billionaire Elon Musk . This announcement positions Microsoft as one of the first major cloud providers to offer managed access to Grok, the AI model known for its controversial and often unfiltered approach.""These models will have all the service level agreements (SLAs) Azure customers expect from any Microsoft product,"" the company stated. The Grok AI models will be hosted and billed directly by Microsoft, making them available to its own product teams and enterprise clients through the Azure AI Foundry service.Elon Musk made a friendly virtual appearance at Microsoft's annual technology showcase to reveal that his Grok artificial intelligence chatbot will now be hosted on Microsoft's data centers. “It’s fantastic to have you at our developer conference,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said to Musk in a pre-recorded video conversation broadcast at Microsoft's Build conference in Seattle.This unexpected addition has already sparked internal discussions and could potentially strain Microsoft's existing partnership with OpenAI , a leading AI research and deployment company in which Microsoft has heavily invested. Over the past year, Microsoft has been strategically diversifying its Azure AI Foundry platform, incorporating models from various AI labs that directly compete with OpenAI's offerings.Available through the Azure AI Foundry platform, Grok 3 and Grok 3 mini will come with the robust service-level agreements that Azure customers have come to expect. Furthermore, Microsoft will handle the billing directly, aligning with the model of other AI models hosted on the platform.Grok, which currently powers several features on Musk's social media platform X, has garnered significant attention for its unconventional approach. When first announced several years ago, Musk positioned Grok as an ""anti-woke"" AI, willing to tackle controversial topics that other AI systems often avoid. This has manifested in Grok's ability to generate vulgar responses when prompted and its generally more permissive stance on sensitive subjects, as indicated by benchmarks like SpeechMap.However, Grok's journey has not been without controversy. Recent reports have highlighted instances of the AI model generating inappropriate responses, including allegedly undressing photos of women. Earlier this year, Grok briefly censored mentions of prominent figures like Donald Trump and Musk himself. Just last week, an ""unauthorized modification"" led Grok to repeatedly generate references to white genocide in South Africa under specific prompts.Notably, the Grok 3 and Grok 3 mini models available through Azure AI Foundry are expected to be more controlled than their counterparts on X. Microsoft has indicated that these models will come with enhanced data integration, customization options, and governance capabilities that may not be readily available through xAI's direct API. This suggests a more enterprise-ready and moderated version of Grok will be offered to Azure customers.The inclusion of Grok in Azure AI Foundry marks a significant step in Microsoft's strategy to offer a diverse range of AI models to its customers, even if it means incorporating technology from a sometimes-contentious figure like Elon Musk and potentially complicating its relationship with key partner OpenAI. The industry will be watching closely to see how this development unfolds and the impact it has on the competitive landscape of AI cloud services.",Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok will now be hosted on Microsoft's data centers. The Grok AI models will be hosted and billed directly by Microsoft. This announcement positions Microsoft as one of the first major cloud providers to offer managed access to Grok.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121276692,imgsize-26882,width-400,resizemode-4/Microsoft-Build-2025-Timings-where-to-watch-and-what-to-expect.jpg"

GTA 6 release and updates FAQs

What is the official release date of GTA 6?

Grand Theft Auto VI will launch on May 26, 2026, according to Rockstar’s announcement on May 2, 2025.

Why was GTA 6 delayed from 2025?

Rockstar stated that the delay was to ensure the game meets the quality expectations of players and the studio’s own development standards.

What platforms will GTA 6 be available on?

Although not officially confirmed, GTA 6 is expected to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Will there be new trailers before the release?

Yes, Rockstar has confirmed that more information and footage will be released in the months following the release date announcement.

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for GTA 6, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

"One question that Geoffrey Hinton, the Godfather of AI says OpenAI’s GPT-4 still gets wrong",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/one-question-that-geoffrey-hinton-the-godfather-of-ai-says-openais-gpt-4-still-gets-wrong/articleshow/121273934.cms,"""Sally has three brothers. Each of her brothers has two sisters. How many sisters does Sally have?""

""It surprises me. It surprises me it still screws up on that,""

Geoffrey Hinton on the limits of AI

Geoffrey Hinton , the Godfather of AI has admitted that he sometimes trusts his favorite chatbot more than he should. In a recent interview with CBS, Hinton revealed that he uses OpenAI 's GPT-4 and he tends to believe what GPT-4 tells him, even though he knows he should be more careful. “I tend to believe what it says, even though I should probably be suspicious,” he said. Sharing an example from his own experience, he said that he once asked GPT-4 a simple riddle:The correct answer is one as Sally herself is one of the two sisters, and each brother has the same two sisters. But GPT-4 answered two, which surprised Hinton.he said during the interview.Stating that while GPT-4 is very advanced, it’s not perfect, he said “It's an expert at everything. It's not a very good expert at everything.”Still, Hinton believes future AI models will improve. When asked if GPT-5 would get the riddle right, he replied, ""Yeah, I suspect.""OpenAI launched GPT-4 in 2023 and became popular for clearing difficult exams like the SAT, GRE, and bar exam. In May 2024, OpenAI released GPT-4o, which became the default model for ChatGPT.The company recently unveiled new models—GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 Mini, and GPT-4.1 Nano that are designed to outperform previous iterations, offering developers more efficient and cost-effective AI solutions.One of the standout features of GPT-4.1 is its expanded context window, supporting up to 1 million tokens, significantly surpassing the 128,000-token limit of its predecessor, GPT-4o.

What Cellcom said about the service outage



“We want to be upfront with you — what we hoped would be a short-term issue is now looking like a longer recovery. Our teams and partners continue working around the clock on a complex technical issue affecting voice and SMS services.

Data, mobile/landline internet, iMessage, and RCS are still working for most. Number porting is currently unavailable. In the meantime, some customers are using apps like WhatsApp or FaceTime to stay connected.

We know how disruptive this is — and how unacceptable it feels. You rely on us, and we’re not meeting that standard right now. We’re truly sorry.

Our teams are here to support you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out with questions, and continue following this page or visit www.cellcom.com/service for updates.

Thank you for sticking with us. Your encouragement and feedback mean more than you know — and we won’t stop until this is resolved.”
